= Gathering information to troubleshoot hosted control planes

When you need to troubleshoot an issue with hosted control plane clusters, you can gather information by running the `hypershift dump cluster` command. The command generates output for the management cluster and the hosted cluster.

The output for the management cluster contains the following content:

* *Cluster-scoped resources:* These resources are node definitions of the management cluster.
* *The `hypershift-dump` compressed file:* This file is useful if you need to share the content with other people.
* *Namespaced resources:* These resources include all of the objects from the relevant namespaces, such as config maps, services, events, and logs.
* *Network logs:* These logs include the OVN northbound and southbound databases and the status for each one.
* *Hosted clusters:* This level of output involves all of the resources inside of the hosted cluster.

The output for the hosted cluster contains the following content:

* *Cluster-scoped resources:* These resources include all of the cluster-wide objects, such as nodes and CRDs.
* *Namespaced resources:* These resources include all of the objects from the relevant namespaces, such as config maps, services, events, and logs.

Although the output does not contain any secret objects from the cluster, it can contain references to the names of secrets.

.Prerequisites

* You must have `cluster-admin` access to the management cluster.

* You need the `name` value for the `HostedCluster` resource and the namespace where the CR is deployed.

* You must have the `hcp` command line interface installed. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.8/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#hosted-install-cli[Installing the hosted control planes command line interface].

* You must have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed.

* You must ensure that the `kubeconfig` file is loaded and is pointing to the management cluster.

.Procedure

* To gather output for troubleshooting, enter the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ CLUSTERNAME="samplecluster"
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ CLUSTERNS="clusters"
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir clusterDump-${CLUSTERNS}-${CLUSTERNAME}
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ hypershift dump cluster \
    --name ${CLUSTERNAME} \
    --namespace ${CLUSTERNS} \
    --dump-guest-cluster \
    --artifact-dir clusterDump-${CLUSTERNS}-${CLUSTERNAME}
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
2023-06-06T12:18:20+02:00   INFO    Archiving dump  {"command": "tar", "args": ["-cvzf", "hypershift-dump.tar.gz", "cluster-scoped-resources", "event-filter.html", "namespaces", "network_logs", "timestamp"]}
2023-06-06T12:18:21+02:00   INFO    Successfully archived dump  {"duration": "1.519376292s"}
----

* To configure the command-line interface so that it impersonates all of the queries against the management cluster by using a username or service account, enter the `hypershift dump cluster` command with the `--as` flag.
+
The service account must have enough permissions to query all of the objects from the namespaces, so the `cluster-admin` role is recommended to make sure you have enough permissions. The service account must be located in or have permissions to query the namespace of the `HostedControlPlane` resource.
+
If your username or service account does not have enough permissions, the output contains only the objects that you have permissions to access. During that process, you might see `forbidden` errors.
+
** To use impersonation by using a service account, enter the following commands. Replace values as necessary:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ CLUSTERNAME="samplecluster"
----
+

= Checking why worker nodes did not join the hosted cluster

If your control plane API endpoint is available, but worker nodes did not join the hosted cluster on AWS, you can debug worker node issues. To troubleshoot why worker nodes did not join the hosted cluster on AWS, you can check the following information.

:FeatureName: Hosted control planes on AWS
// When including this file, ensure that {FeatureName} is set immediately before
// the include. Otherwise it will result in an incorrect replacement.

:!FeatureName:

.Prerequisites
//lahinson - sept. 2023 - after ACM 2.9 is GA on 13 Nov., update this link to point to 2.9
* You have link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.8/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#hosting-service-cluster-configure-aws[configured the hosting cluster on AWS].
* Your control plane API endpoint is available.

.Procedure

. Address any error messages in the status of the `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` resources:

.. Check the status of the `HostedCluster` resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get hc -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> <hosted_cluster_name> -o jsonpath='{.status}'
----

.. Check the status of the `NodePool` resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get hc -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> <hosted_cluster_name> -o jsonpath='{.status}'
----
+
If you did not find any error messages in the status of the `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` resources, proceed to the next step.

. Check if your worker machines are created by running the following commands, replacing values as necessary:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ HC_NAMESPACE="clusters"
$ HC_NAME="cluster_name"
$ CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE="${HC_NAMESPACE}-${HC_NAME}"
$ oc get machines.cluster.x-k8s.io -n $CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE
$ oc get awsmachines -n $CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE
----

. If worker machines do not exist, check if the `machinedeployment` and `machineset` resources are created by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinedeployment -n $CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE
$ oc get machineset -n $CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE
----

. If the `machinedeployment` and `machineset` resources do not exist, check logs of the HyperShift Operator by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs deployment/operator -n hypershift
----

. If worker machines exist but are not provisioned in the hosted cluster, check the log of the cluster API provider by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs deployment/capi-provider -c manager -n $CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE
----

. If worker machines exist and are provisioned in the cluster, ensure that machines are initialized through Ignition successfully by checking the system console logs. Check the system console logs of every machine by using the `console-logs` utility by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./bin/hypershift console-logs aws --name $HC_NAME --aws-creds ~/.aws/credentials --output-dir /tmp/console-logs
----
+
You can access the system console logs in the `/tmp/console-logs` directory. The control plane exposes the Ignition endpoint. If you see an error related to the Ignition endpoint, then the Ignition endpoint is not accessible from the worker nodes through `https`.

. If worker machines are provisioned and initialized through Ignition successfully, you can extract and access the journal logs of every worker machine by creating a bastion machine. A bastion machine allows you to access worker machines by using SSH.

.. Create a bastion machine by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./bin/hypershift create bastion aws --aws-creds ~/.aws/credentials --name $CLUSTER_NAME --ssh-key-file /tmp/ssh/id_rsa.pub
----

.. Optional: If you used the `--generate-ssh` flag when creating the cluster, you can extract the public and private key for the cluster by running the following commands:
+
[souce,terminal]
----
$ mkdir /tmp/ssh
$ oc get secret -n clusters ${HC_NAME}-ssh-key -o jsonpath='{ .data.id_rsa }' | base64 -d > /tmp/ssh/id_rsa
$ oc get secret -n clusters ${HC_NAME}-ssh-key -o jsonpath='{ .data.id_rsa\.pub }' | base64 -d > /tmp/ssh/id_rsa.pub
----

.. Extract journal logs from the every worker machine by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir /tmp/journals
$ INFRAID="$(oc get hc -n clusters $CLUSTER_NAME -o jsonpath='{ .spec.infraID }')"
$ SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=/tmp/ssh/id_rsa
$ ./test/e2e/util/dump/copy-machine-journals.sh /tmp/journals
----
+
You must place journal logs in the `/tmp/journals` directory in a compressed format. Check for the error that indicates why kubelet did not join the cluster.
