You can deploy {product-title} clusters by using two different control plane configurations: standalone or hosted control planes. The standalone configuration uses dedicated virtual machines or physical machines to host the control plane. With hosted control planes for {product-title}, you create control planes as pods on a hosting cluster without the need for dedicated virtual or physical machines for each control plane.

[id="hosted-control-planes-architecture_{context}"]
== Architecture of hosted control planes

{product-title} is often deployed in a coupled, or standalone, model, where a cluster consists of a control plane and a data plane. The control plane includes an API endpoint, a storage endpoint, a workload scheduler, and an actuator that ensures state. The data plane includes compute, storage, and networking where workloads and applications run.

The standalone control plane is hosted by a dedicated group of nodes, which can be physical or virtual, with a minimum number to ensure quorum. The network stack is shared. Administrator access to a cluster offers visibility into the cluster's control plane, machine management APIs, and other components that contribute to the state of a cluster.

Although the standalone model works well, some situations require an architecture where the control plane and data plane are decoupled. In those cases, the data plane is on a separate network domain with a dedicated physical hosting environment. The control plane is hosted by using high-level primitives such as deployments and stateful sets that are native to Kubernetes. The control plane is treated as any other workload.

[id="hosted-control-planes-benefits_{context}"]
== Benefits of hosted control planes

With hosted control planes for {product-title}, you can pave the way for a true hybrid-cloud approach and enjoy several other benefits.

* The security boundaries between management and workloads are stronger because the control plane is decoupled and hosted on a dedicated hosting service cluster. As a result, you are less likely to leak credentials for clusters to other users. Because infrastructure secret account management is also decoupled, cluster infrastructure administrators cannot accidentally delete control plane infrastructure.

* With hosted control planes, you can run many control planes on fewer nodes. As a result, clusters are more affordable.

* Because the control planes consist of pods that are launched on {product-title}, control planes start quickly. The same principles apply to control planes and workloads, such as monitoring, logging, and auto-scaling.

* From an infrastructure perspective, you can push registries, HAProxy, cluster monitoring, storage nodes, and other infrastructure components to the tenant's cloud provider account, isolating usage to the tenant.

* From an operational perspective, multicluster management is more centralized, which results in fewer external factors that affect the cluster status and consistency. Site reliability engineers have a central place to debug issues and navigate to the cluster data plane, which can lead to shorter Time to Resolution (TTR) and greater productivity.

[id="hosted-control-planes-concepts-personas_{context}"]
= Glossary of common concepts and personas for hosted control planes

When you use hosted control planes for {product-title}, it is important to understand its key concepts and the personas that are involved.

[id="hosted-control-planes-concepts_{context}"]
== Concepts

hosted cluster:: An {product-title} cluster with its control plane and API endpoint hosted on a management cluster. The hosted cluster includes the control plane and its corresponding data plane.

hosted cluster infrastructure:: Network, compute, and storage resources that exist in the tenant or end-user cloud account.

hosted control plane:: An {product-title} control plane that runs on the management cluster, which is exposed by the API endpoint of a hosted cluster. The components of a control plane include etcd, the Kubernetes API server, the Kubernetes controller manager, and a VPN.

hosting cluster:: See _management cluster_.

managed cluster:: A cluster that the hub cluster manages. This term is specific to the cluster lifecycle that the multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator manages in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management. A managed cluster is not the same thing as a _management cluster_. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.8/html/about/welcome-to-red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-for-kubernetes#managed-cluster[Managed cluster].

management cluster:: An {product-title} cluster where the HyperShift Operator is deployed and where the control planes for hosted clusters are hosted. The management cluster is synonymous with the _hosting cluster_.

management cluster infrastructure:: Network, compute, and storage resources of the management cluster.

[id="hosted-control-planes-personas_{context}"]
== Personas

cluster instance administrator:: Users who assume this role are the equivalent of administrators in standalone {product-title}. This user has the `cluster-admin` role in the provisioned cluster, but might not have power over when or how the cluster is updated or configured. This user might have read-only access to see some configuration projected into the cluster.

cluster instance user:: Users who assume this role are the equivalent of developers in standalone {product-title}. This user does not have a view into OperatorHub or machines.

cluster service consumer:: Users who assume this role can request control planes and worker nodes, drive updates, or modify externalized configurations. Typically, this user does not manage or access cloud credentials or infrastructure encryption keys. The cluster service consumer persona can request hosted clusters and interact with node pools. Users who assume this role have RBAC to create, read, update, or delete hosted clusters and node pools within a logical boundary.

cluster service provider:: Users who assume this role typically have the `cluster-admin` role on the management cluster and have RBAC to monitor and own the availability of the HyperShift Operator as well as the control planes for the tenant's hosted clusters. The cluster service provider persona is responsible for several activities, including the following examples:
** Owning service-level objects for control plane availability, uptime, and stability
** Configuring the cloud account for the management cluster to host control planes
** Configuring the user-provisioned infrastructure, which includes the host awareness of available compute resources

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="hosted-control-planes-version-support_{context}"]
= Versioning for hosted control planes

With each major, minor, or patch version release of {product-title}, two components of hosted control planes are released:

* HyperShift Operator
* Command-line interface (CLI)

The HyperShift Operator manages the lifecycle of hosted clusters that are represented by `HostedCluster` API resources. The HyperShift Operator is released with each {product-title} release. After the HyperShift Operator is installed, it creates a config map called `supported-versions` in the HyperShift namespace, as shown in the following example. The config map describes the HostedCluster versions that can be deployed.

[source,yaml]
----
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      supported-versions: '{"versions":["4.14"]}'
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      labels:
        hypershift.openshift.io/supported-versions: "true"
      name: supported-versions
      namespace: hypershift
----

The CLI is a helper utility for development purposes. The CLI is released as part of any HyperShift Operator release. No compatibility policies are guaranteed.

The API, `hypershift.openshift.io`, provides a way to create and manage lightweight, flexible, heterogeneous {product-title} clusters at scale. The API exposes two user-facing resources: `HostedCluster` and `NodePool`. A `HostedCluster` resource encapsulates the control plane and common data plane configuration. When you create a `HostedCluster` resource, you have a fully functional control plane with no attached nodes. A `NodePool` resource is a scalable set of worker nodes that is attached to a `HostedCluster` resource.

The API version policy generally aligns with the policy for link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/#api-versioning[Kubernetes API versioning].
