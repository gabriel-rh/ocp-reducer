toc::[]

For users to interact with {product-title}, they must first authenticate
to the cluster. The authentication layer identifies the user associated with requests to the
{product-title} API. The authorization layer then uses information about the
requesting user to determine if the request is allowed.

= Users

A _user_ in {product-title} is an entity that can make requests to the
{product-title} API. An {product-title} `User` object represents an actor which
can be granted permissions in the system by adding roles to them or to their
groups. Typically, this represents the account of a developer or
administrator that is interacting with {product-title}.

Several types of users can exist:

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===

|User type
|Description

|`Regular users`
|This is the way most interactive {product-title} users are
represented. Regular users are created automatically in the system upon
first login or can be created via the API. Regular users are represented
with the `User` object. Examples: `joe` `alice`

|`System users`
|Many of these are created automatically when the infrastructure
 is defined, mainly for the purpose of enabling the infrastructure to
 interact with the API securely. They include a cluster administrator
 (with access to everything), a per-node user, users for use by routers
 and registries, and various others. Finally, there is an `anonymous`
 system user that is used by default for unauthenticated requests. Examples:
`system:admin` `system:openshift-registry` `system:node:node1.example.com`

|`Service accounts`
|These are special system users associated with projects; some are created automatically when
the project is first created, while project administrators can create more
for the purpose of defining access to the contents of each project.
Service accounts are represented with the `ServiceAccount` object. Examples:
`system:serviceaccount:default:deployer` `system:serviceaccount:foo:builder`

|===

Each user must authenticate in
some way to access {product-title}. API requests with no authentication
or invalid authentication are authenticated as requests by the `anonymous`
system user. After authentication, policy determines what the user is
authorized to do.

[id="rbac-groups_{context}"]
= Groups

A user can be assigned to one or more _groups_, each of which represent a
certain set of users. Groups are useful when managing authorization policies
to grant permissions to multiple users at once, for example allowing
access to objects within a project, versus granting
them to users individually.

In addition to explicitly defined groups, there are also
system groups, or _virtual groups_, that are automatically provisioned by
the cluster.

The following default virtual groups are most important:

//WHY?

[cols="2,5",options="header"]
|===

|Virtual group |Description

|`system:authenticated` |Automatically associated with all authenticated users.
|`system:authenticated:oauth` |Automatically associated with all users authenticated with an OAuth access token.
|`system:unauthenticated` |Automatically associated with all unauthenticated users.

[id="rbac-api-authentication_{context}"]
= API authentication
Requests to the {product-title} API are authenticated using the following
methods:

OAuth access tokens::
* Obtained from the {product-title} OAuth server using the
`_<namespace_route>_/oauth/authorize` and `_<namespace_route>_/oauth/token`
endpoints.
* Sent as an `Authorization: Bearer...` header.
* Sent as a websocket subprotocol header in the form
`base64url.bearer.authorization.k8s.io.<base64url-encoded-token>` for websocket
requests.

X.509 client certificates::
* Requires an HTTPS connection to the API server.
* Verified by the API server against a trusted certificate authority bundle.
* The API server creates and distributes certificates to controllers to authenticate themselves.

Any request with an invalid access token or an invalid certificate is rejected
by the authentication layer with a `401` error.

If no access token or certificate is presented, the authentication layer assigns
the `system:anonymous` virtual user and the `system:unauthenticated` virtual
group to the request. This allows the authorization layer to determine which
requests, if any, an anonymous user is allowed to make.

[id="oauth-server-overview_{context}"]
= {product-title} OAuth server

The {product-title} master includes a built-in OAuth server. Users obtain OAuth
access tokens to authenticate themselves to the API.

When a person requests a new OAuth token, the OAuth server uses the configured
identity provider
to determine the identity of the person making the request.

It then determines what user that identity maps to, creates an access token for
that user, and returns the token for use.

[id="oauth-token-requests_{context}"]
== OAuth token requests

Every request for an OAuth token must specify the OAuth client that will
receive and use the token. The following OAuth clients are automatically
created when starting the {product-title} API:

[options="header"]
|===

|OAuth client |Usage

|`openshift-browser-client`
|Requests tokens at `<namespace_route>/oauth/token/request` with a user-agent that can handle interactive logins. ^[1]^

|`openshift-challenging-client`
|Requests tokens with a user-agent that can handle `WWW-Authenticate` challenges.

|===
[.small]

1. `<namespace_route>` refers to the namespace route. This is found by
running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get route oauth-openshift -n openshift-authentication -o json | jq .spec.host
----
--

All requests for OAuth tokens involve a request to
`<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize`. Most authentication integrations place an
authenticating proxy in front of this endpoint, or configure
{product-title} to validate credentials against a backing identity provider.
Requests to `<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize` can come from user-agents that
cannot display interactive login pages, such as the CLI. Therefore,
{product-title} supports authenticating using a `WWW-Authenticate`
challenge in addition to interactive login flows.

If an authenticating proxy is placed in front of the
`<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize` endpoint, it sends unauthenticated,
non-browser user-agents `WWW-Authenticate` challenges rather than
displaying an interactive login page or redirecting to an interactive
login flow.

[NOTE]
====
To prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against browser
clients,  only send Basic authentication challenges with if a
`X-CSRF-Token` header is on the request. Clients that expect
to receive Basic `WWW-Authenticate` challenges must set this header to a
non-empty value.

If the authenticating proxy cannot support `WWW-Authenticate` challenges,
or if {product-title} is configured to use an identity provider that does
not support WWW-Authenticate challenges, you must use a browser to manually
obtain a token from
`<namespace_route>/oauth/token/request`.
