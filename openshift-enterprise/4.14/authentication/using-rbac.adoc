[id="authorization-overview_{context}"]
= RBAC overview

Role-based access control (RBAC) objects determine whether a user is allowed to
perform a given action within a project.

administrators can use the cluster roles and
bindings to control who has various access levels to the {product-title}
platform itself and all projects.

Developers can use local roles and bindings to control who has access
to their projects. Note that authorization is a separate step from
authentication, which is more about determining the identity of who is taking the action.

Authorization is managed using:

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===

|Authorization object |Description

|Rules |Sets of permitted verbs on a set of objects. For example,
whether a user or service account can `create` pods.

|Roles |Collections of rules. You can associate, or bind, users and groups
to multiple roles.

|Bindings |Associations between users and/or groups with a role.
|===


Be mindful of the difference between local and cluster bindings. For example,
if you bind the `cluster-admin` role to a user by using a local role binding,
it might appear that this user has the privileges of a cluster administrator.
This is not the case. Binding the `cluster-admin` to a user in a project
grants super administrator privileges for only that
project to the user. That user has the permissions of the cluster role
`admin`, plus a few additional permissions like the ability to edit rate limits,
for that project.
This binding can be confusing via the web console UI, which does not list
cluster role bindings that are bound to true cluster administrators. However, it
does list local role bindings that you can use to locally bind `cluster-admin`.

////
If you do, when you upgrade
your cluster, the default roles are updated and
automatically reconciled when the server is started. During reconciliation, any
permissions that are missing from
the default roles are added. If you added more permissions to the role, they are
not removed.

If you customized the default roles and configured them to prevent automatic
role reconciliation, you must manually update policy definitions
when you upgrade {product-title}.
////


The relationships between cluster roles, local roles, cluster role bindings,
local role bindings, users, groups and service accounts are illustrated below.

image::rbac.png[{product-title} RBAC]

[WARNING]
====
The `get pods/exec`, `get pods/*`, and `get *` rules grant execution privileges when they are applied to a role. Apply the principle of least privilege and assign only the minimal RBAC rights required for users and agents. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6989997[RBAC rules allow execution privileges].
====

[id="evaluating-authorization_{context}"]
== Evaluating authorization

{product-title} evaluates authorization by using:

Identity:: The user name and list of groups that the user belongs to.

Action:: The action you perform. In most cases, this consists of:
* *Project*: The project you access. A project is a Kubernetes namespace with
additional annotations that allows a community of users to organize and manage
their content in isolation from other communities.
* *Verb* : The action itself:  `get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `deletecollection`, or `watch`.
* *Resource name*: The API endpoint that you access.
Bindings:: The full list of bindings, the associations between users or groups
with a role.

{product-title} evaluates authorization by using the following steps:

. The identity and the project-scoped action is used to find all bindings that
apply to the user or their groups.
. Bindings are used to locate all the roles that apply.
. Roles are used to find all the rules that apply.
. The action is checked against each rule to find a match.
. If no matching rule is found, the action is then denied by default.


including a matrix of the verbs and resources each are associated with.

[id="rbac-projects-namespaces_{context}"]
= Projects and namespaces

A Kubernetes _namespace_ provides a mechanism to scope resources in a cluster.
The
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/namespaces/[Kubernetes documentation]
has more information on namespaces.

Namespaces provide a unique scope for:

* Named resources to avoid basic naming collisions.
* Delegated management authority to trusted users.
* The ability to limit community resource consumption.

Most objects in the system are scoped by namespace, but some are
excepted and have no namespace, including nodes and users.

A _project_ is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations and is the central vehicle
by which access to resources for regular users is managed.
A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in
isolation from other communities. Users must be given access to projects by administrators,
or if allowed to create projects, automatically have access to their own projects.

Projects can have a separate `name`, `displayName`, and `description`.

- The mandatory `name` is a unique identifier for the project and is most visible when using the CLI tools or API. The maximum name length is 63 characters.
- The optional `displayName` is how the project is displayed in the web console (defaults to `name`).
- The optional `description` can be a more detailed description of the project and is also visible in the web console.

Each project scopes its own set of:

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===

|Object
|Description

|`Objects`
|Pods, services, replication controllers, etc.

|`Policies`
|Rules for which users can or cannot perform actions on objects.

|`Constraints`
|Quotas for each kind of object that can be limited.

|`Service accounts`
|Service accounts act automatically with designated access to objects in the project.

|===

Cluster administrators can create projects and delegate administrative rights
for the project to any member of the user community. Cluster administrators can
also allow developers to create their own projects.

Developers and administrators can interact with projects by using the CLI or the
web console.

[id="rbac-default-projects_{context}"]
= Default projects

{product-title} comes with a number of default projects, and projects
starting with `openshift-` are the most essential to users.
These projects host master components that run as pods and other infrastructure
components. The pods created in these namespaces that have a
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/guaranteed-scheduling-critical-addon-pods/#rescheduler-guaranteed-scheduling-of-critical-add-ons[critical pod annotation]
are considered critical, and the have guaranteed admission by kubelet.
Pods created for master components in these namespaces are already marked as
critical.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not run workloads in or share access to default projects. Default projects are reserved for running core cluster components.

The following default projects are considered highly privileged: `default`, `kube-public`, `kube-system`, `openshift`, `openshift-infra`, `openshift-node`, and other system-created projects that have the `openshift.io/run-level` label set to `0` or `1`. Functionality that relies on admission plugins, such as pod security admission, security context constraints, cluster resource quotas, and image reference resolution, does not work in highly privileged projects.

[id="adding-roles_{context}"]
= Adding roles to users

You can use  the `oc adm` administrator CLI to manage the roles and bindings.

Binding, or adding, a role to users or groups gives the user or group the access
that is granted by the role. You can add and remove roles to and from users and
groups using `oc adm policy` commands.

You can bind any of the default cluster roles to local users or groups in your
project.

.Procedure

. Add a role to a user in a specific project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user <role> <user> -n <project>
----
+
For example, you can add the `admin` role to the `alice` user in `joe` project
by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin alice -n joe
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the role to the user:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: admin-0
  namespace: joe
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: admin
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: alice
----
====

. View the local role bindings and verify the addition in the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac -n <project>
----
