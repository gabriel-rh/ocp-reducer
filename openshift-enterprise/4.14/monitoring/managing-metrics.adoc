[id="understanding-metrics_{context}"]
= Understanding metrics

[role="_abstract"]
In {product-title} {product-version},
cluster components are monitored by scraping metrics exposed through service endpoints. You can also configure metrics collection for user-defined projects. Metrics enable you to monitor how cluster components and your own workloads are performing.

You can define the metrics that you want to provide for your own workloads by using Prometheus client libraries at the application level.

In {product-title}, metrics are exposed through an HTTP service endpoint under the `/metrics` canonical name. You can list all available metrics for a service by running a `curl` query against `\http://<endpoint>/metrics`. For instance, you can expose a route to the `prometheus-example-app` example application and then run the following to view all of its available metrics:

[source,terminal]
----
$ curl http://<example_app_endpoint>/metrics
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
# HELP http_requests_total Count of all HTTP requests
# TYPE http_requests_total counter
http_requests_total{code="200",method="get"} 4
http_requests_total{code="404",method="get"} 2

You can create a `ServiceMonitor` resource to scrape metrics from a service endpoint in a user-defined project. This assumes that your application uses a Prometheus client library to expose metrics to the `/metrics` canonical name.

This section describes how to deploy a sample service in a user-defined project and then create a `ServiceMonitor` resource that defines how that service should be monitored.

= Deploying a sample service

To test monitoring of a service in a user-defined project, you can deploy a sample service.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for the service configuration. In this example, it is called `prometheus-example-app.yaml`.

. Add the following deployment and service configuration details to the file:
+
[source,yaml]

    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
    name: web
  selector:
    app: prometheus-example-app
  type: ClusterIP
----
+
This configuration deploys a service named `prometheus-example-app` in the user-defined `ns1` project. This service exposes the custom `version` metric.

. Apply the configuration to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f prometheus-example-app.yaml
----
+
It takes some time to deploy the service.

. You can check that the pod is running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n ns1 get pod
----
+
.Example output

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="specifying-how-a-service-is-monitored_{context}"]
= Specifying how a service is monitored

[role="_abstract"]
To use the metrics exposed by your service, you must configure {product-title} monitoring to scrape metrics from the `/metrics` endpoint. You can do this using a `ServiceMonitor` custom resource definition (CRD) that specifies how a service should be monitored, or a `PodMonitor` CRD that specifies how a pod should be monitored. The former requires a `Service` object, while the latter does not, allowing Prometheus to directly scrape metrics from the metrics endpoint exposed by a pod.

This procedure shows you how to create a `ServiceMonitor` resource for a service in a user-defined project.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role or the `monitoring-edit` cluster role.
* You have enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* For this example, you have deployed the `prometheus-example-app` sample service in the `ns1` project.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `prometheus-example-app` sample service does not support TLS authentication.
====

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for the `ServiceMonitor` resource configuration. In this example, the file is called `example-app-service-monitor.yaml`.

. Add the following `ServiceMonitor` resource configuration details:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    k8s-app: prometheus-example-monitor
  name: prometheus-example-monitor
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  endpoints:
  - interval: 30s
    port: web
    scheme: http
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus-example-app
----
+
This defines a `ServiceMonitor` resource that scrapes the metrics exposed by the `prometheus-example-app` sample service, which includes the `version` metric.
+
[NOTE]
====
A `ServiceMonitor` resource in a user-defined namespace can only discover services in the same namespace. That is, the `namespaceSelector` field of the `ServiceMonitor` resource is always ignored.
====

. Apply the configuration to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f example-app-service-monitor.yaml
----
+
It takes some time to deploy the `ServiceMonitor` resource.

. You can check that the `ServiceMonitor` resource is running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n ns1 get servicemonitor
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                         AGE
prometheus-example-monitor   81m
