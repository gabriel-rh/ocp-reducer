[id="about-using-redfish-hardware-events"]
== About bare-metal events

Use the {redfish-operator} to subscribe applications that run in your {product-title} cluster to events that are generated on the underlying bare-metal host. The Redfish service publishes events on a node and transmits them on an advanced message queue to subscribed applications.

Bare-metal events are based on the open Redfish standard that is developed under the guidance of the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). Redfish provides a secure industry-standard protocol with a REST API. The protocol is used for the management of distributed, converged or software-defined resources and infrastructure.

Hardware-related events published through Redfish includes:

* Breaches of temperature limits
* Server status
* Fan status

Begin using bare-metal events by deploying the {redfish-operator} Operator and subscribing your application to the service. The {redfish-operator} Operator installs and manages the lifecycle of the Redfish bare-metal event service.

[NOTE]
====
The {redfish-operator} works only with Redfish-capable devices on single-node clusters provisioned on bare-metal infrastructure.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="nw-rfhe-introduction_{context}"]
= How bare-metal events work

The {redfish-operator} enables applications running on bare-metal clusters to respond quickly to Redfish hardware changes and failures such as breaches of temperature thresholds, fan failure, disk loss, power outages, and memory failure. These hardware events are delivered over a reliable low-latency transport channel based on Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). The latency of the messaging service is between 10 to 20 milliseconds.

The {redfish-operator} provides a publish-subscribe service for the hardware events. Applications can use a REST API to subscribe to the events. The {redfish-operator} supports hardware that complies with Redfish OpenAPI v1.8 or later.

[id="rfhe-elements_{context}"]
== {redfish-operator} data flow

The following figure illustrates an example bare-metal events data flow:

.{redfish-operator} data flow
image::319_OpenShift_redfish_bare-metal_OCP_nodes_0323.png[Bare-metal events data flow]

=== Operator-managed pod

The Operator uses custom resources to manage the pod containing the {redfish-operator} and its components using the `HardwareEvent` CR.

=== {redfish-operator}

At startup, the {redfish-operator} queries the Redfish API and downloads all the message registries, including custom registries. The {redfish-operator} then begins to receive subscribed events from the Redfish hardware.

The {redfish-operator} enables applications running on bare-metal clusters to respond quickly to Redfish hardware changes and failures such as breaches of temperature thresholds, fan failure, disk loss, power outages, and memory failure. The events are reported using the `HardwareEvent` CR.

=== Cloud native event

Cloud native events (CNE) is a REST API specification for defining the format of event data.

=== CNCF CloudEvents

link:https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] is a vendor-neutral specification developed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) for defining the format of event data.

=== HTTP transport or AMQP dispatch router

The HTTP transport or AMQP dispatch router is responsible for the message delivery service between publisher and subscriber.

[NOTE]
====
Use HTTP transport instead of AMQP for PTP and bare-metal events where possible.
AMQ Interconnect is EOL from 30 June 2024.
Extended life cycle support (ELS) for AMQ Interconnect ends 29 November 2029.
For more information see, link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes#p_Interconnect[Red Hat AMQ Interconnect support status].
====

=== Cloud event proxy sidecar

The cloud event proxy sidecar container image is based on the O-RAN API specification and provides a publish-subscribe event framework for hardware events.

[id="rfhe-data-flow_{context}"]
== Redfish message parsing service

In addition to handling Redfish events, the {redfish-operator} provides message parsing for events without a `Message` property. The proxy downloads all the Redfish message registries including vendor specific registries from the hardware when it starts. If an event does not contain a `Message` property, the proxy uses the Redfish message registries to construct the `Message` and `Resolution` properties and add them to the event before passing the event to the cloud events framework. This service allows Redfish events to have smaller message size and lower transmission latency.

[id="subscribing-hw-events"]
== Subscribing to Redfish BMC bare-metal events for a cluster node

You can subscribe to Redfish BMC events generated on a node in your cluster by creating a `BMCEventSubscription` custom resource (CR) for the node, creating a `HardwareEvent` CR for the event, and creating a `Secret` CR for the BMC.

:leveloffset: +2

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * monitoring/using-rfhe.adoc

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="nw-rfhe-creating-bmc-event-sub_{context}"]
= Subscribing to bare-metal events

You can configure the baseboard management controller (BMC) to send bare-metal events to subscribed applications running in an {product-title} cluster. Example Redfish bare-metal events include an increase in device temperature, or removal of a device. You subscribe applications to bare-metal events using a REST API.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only create a `BMCEventSubscription` custom resource (CR) for physical hardware that supports Redfish and has a vendor interface set to `redfish` or `idrac-redfish`.
====

[NOTE]
====
Use the `BMCEventSubscription` CR to subscribe to predefined Redfish events. The Redfish standard does not provide an option to create specific alerts and thresholds. For example, to receive an alert event when an enclosure's temperature exceeds 40° Celsius, you must manually configure the event according to the vendor's recommendations.
====

Perform the following procedure to subscribe to bare-metal events for the node using a `BMCEventSubscription` CR.

.Prerequisites
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* Get the user name and password for the BMC.

* Deploy a bare-metal node with a Redfish-enabled Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) in your cluster, and enable Redfish events on the BMC.
+
[NOTE]
====
Enabling Redfish events on specific hardware is outside the scope of this information. For more information about enabling Redfish events for your specific hardware, consult the BMC manufacturer documentation.
====

.Procedure

. Confirm that the node hardware has the Redfish `EventService` enabled by running the following `curl` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl https://<bmc_ip_address>/redfish/v1/EventService --insecure -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u "<bmc_username>:<password>"

= Querying Redfish bare-metal event subscriptions with curl

Some hardware vendors limit the amount of Redfish hardware event subscriptions. You can query the number of Redfish event subscriptions by using `curl`.

.Prerequisites
* Get the user name and password for the BMC.
* Deploy a bare-metal node with a Redfish-enabled Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) in your cluster, and enable Redfish hardware events on the BMC.

.Procedure

. Check the current subscriptions for the BMC by running the following `curl` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl --globoff -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X GET --user <bmc_username>:<password> https://<bmc_ip_address>/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions
----
+
where:
+
--
bmc_ip_address:: is the IP address of the BMC where the Redfish events are generated.
--
+

[id="nw-rfhe-creating-hardware-event_{context}"]
= Creating the bare-metal event and Secret CRs

To start using bare-metal events, create the `HardwareEvent` custom resource (CR) for the host where the Redfish hardware is present. Hardware events and faults are reported in the `hw-event-proxy` logs.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {product-title} CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have installed the {redfish-operator}.

* You have created a `BMCEventSubscription` CR for the BMC Redfish hardware.

.Procedure

. Create the `HardwareEvent` custom resource (CR):
+
[NOTE]
====
Multiple `HardwareEvent` resources are not permitted.
====

.. Save the following YAML in the `hw-event.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "event.redhat-cne.org/v1alpha1"
kind: "HardwareEvent"
metadata:
  name: "hardware-event"
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/hw-event: "" <1>
  logLevel: "debug" <2>
  msgParserTimeout: "10" <3>
----
+
--
<1> Required. Use the `nodeSelector` field to target nodes with the specified label, for example, `node-role.kubernetes.io/hw-event: ""`.
+
[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} 4.13 or later, you do not need to set the `spec.transportHost` field in the `HardwareEvent` resource when you use HTTP transport for bare-metal events.
Set `transportHost` only when you use AMQP transport for bare-metal events.
====
<2> Optional. The default value is `debug`. Sets the log level in `hw-event-proxy` logs. The following log levels are available: `fatal`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`.
<3> Optional. Sets the timeout value in milliseconds for the Message Parser. If a message parsing request is not responded to within the timeout duration, the original hardware event message is passed to the cloud native event framework. The default value is 10.
--

.. Apply the `HardwareEvent` CR in the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f hardware-event.yaml
----

. Create a BMC username and password `Secret` CR that enables the hardware events proxy to access the Redfish message registry for the bare-metal host.
+
.. Save the following YAML in the `hw-event-bmc-secret.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: redfish-basic-auth
type: Opaque
stringData: <1>
  username: <bmc_username>
  password: <bmc_password>
  # BMC host DNS or IP address
  hostaddr: <bmc_host_ip_address>
----
<1> Enter plain text values for the various items under `stringData`.
+
.. Create the `Secret` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f hw-event-bmc-secret.yaml

= Subscribing applications to bare-metal events REST API reference

Use the bare-metal events REST API to subscribe an application to the bare-metal events that are generated on the parent node.

Subscribe applications to Redfish events by using the resource address `/cluster/node/<node_name>/redfish/event`, where `<node_name>` is the cluster node running the application.

Deploy your `cloud-event-consumer` application container and `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar container in a separate application pod. The `cloud-event-consumer` application subscribes to the `cloud-event-proxy` container in the application pod.

Use the following API endpoints to subscribe the `cloud-event-consumer` application to Redfish events posted by the `cloud-event-proxy` container at [x-]`http://localhost:8089/api/ocloudNotifications/v1/` in the application pod:

* `/api/ocloudNotifications/v1/subscriptions`
- `POST`: Creates a new subscription
- `GET`: Retrieves a list of subscriptions
* `/api/ocloudNotifications/v1/subscriptions/<subscription_id>`
- `GET`: Returns details for the specified subscription ID
* `api/ocloudNotifications/v1/subscriptions/status/<subscription_id>`
- `PUT`: Creates a new status ping request for the specified subscription ID
* `/api/ocloudNotifications/v1/health`
- `GET`: Returns the health status of `ocloudNotifications` API

[NOTE]
====
`9089` is the default port for the `cloud-event-consumer` container deployed in the application pod. You can configure a different port for your application as required.

[id="cnf-migrating-from-amqp-to-http-transport_{context}"]
= Migrating consumer applications to use HTTP transport for PTP or bare-metal events

If you have previously deployed PTP or bare-metal events consumer applications, you need to update the applications to use HTTP message transport.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have updated the PTP Operator or {redfish-operator} to version 4.13+ which uses HTTP transport by default.

.Procedure

. Update your events consumer application to use HTTP transport.
Set the `http-event-publishers` variable for the cloud event sidecar deployment.
+
For example, in a cluster with PTP events configured, the following YAML snippet illustrates a cloud event sidecar deployment:
+
[source,yaml]
----
containers:
  - name: cloud-event-sidecar
    image: cloud-event-sidecar
    args:
      - "--metrics-addr=127.0.0.1:9091"
      - "--store-path=/store"
      - "--transport-host=consumer-events-subscription-service.cloud-events.svc.cluster.local:9043"
      - "--http-event-publishers=ptp-event-publisher-service-NODE_NAME.openshift-ptp.svc.cluster.local:9043" <1>
      - "--api-port=8089"
----
<1> The PTP Operator automatically resolves `NODE_NAME` to the host that is generating the PTP events.
For example, `compute-1.example.com`.
+
In a cluster with bare-metal events configured, set the `http-event-publishers` field to `hw-event-publisher-service.openshift-bare-metal-events.svc.cluster.local:9043` in the cloud event sidecar deployment CR.

. Deploy the `consumer-events-subscription-service` service alongside the events consumer application.
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name: sidecar-consumer-secret
  name: consumer-events-subscription-service
  namespace: cloud-events
  labels:
    app: consumer-service
spec:
  ports:
    - name: sub-port
      port: 9043
  selector:
    app: consumer
  clusterIP: None
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: ClusterIP
