// The {product-title} attribute provides the context-sensitive name of the relevant OpenShift distribution, for example, "OpenShift Container Platform" or "OKD". The {product-version} attribute provides the product version relative to the distribution, for example "4.9".
// {product-title} and {product-version} are parsed when AsciiBinder queries the _distro_map.yml file in relation to the base branch of a pull request.

You can install {DTProductName} on {product-title} in either of two ways:

* You can install {DTProductName} as part of {SMProductName}. Distributed tracing is included by default in the Service Mesh installation. To install {DTProductName} as part of a service mesh, follow the xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/preparing-ossm-installation.adoc#preparing-ossm-installation[Red Hat Service Mesh Installation] instructions. You must install {DTProductName} in the same namespace as your service mesh, that is, the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` and the {DTProductName} resources must be in the same namespace.

* If you do not want to install a service mesh, you can use the {DTProductName} Operators to install {DTShortName} by itself. To install {DTProductName} without a service mesh, use the following instructions.

[id="prerequisites"]
== Prerequisites

Before you can install {DTProductName}, review the installation activities, and ensure that you meet the prerequisites:

* Possess an active {product-title} subscription on your Red Hat account. If you do not have a subscription, contact your sales representative for more information.

* Review the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-overview_architecture-installation[{product-title} {product-version} overview].
* Install {product-title} {product-version}.

** xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installing-aws-account[Install {product-title} {product-version} on AWS]
** xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-user-infra.adoc#installing-aws-user-infra[Install {product-title} {product-version} on user-provisioned AWS]

** xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere.adoc#installing-vsphere[Install {product-title} {product-version} on vSphere]
* Install the version of the `oc` CLI tool that matches your {product-title} version and add it to your path.

* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

= {DTProductName} installation overview

The steps for installing {DTProductName} are as follows:

* Review the documentation and determine your deployment strategy.

* If your deployment strategy requires persistent storage, install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator via the OperatorHub.

* Install the {JaegerName} Operator via the OperatorHub.

* Modify the custom resource YAML file to support your deployment strategy.

* Deploy one or more instances of {JaegerName} to your {product-title} environment.

[id="distr-tracing-operator-install-elasticsearch_{context}"]
= Installing the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator

The default {JaegerName} deployment uses in-memory storage because it is designed to be installed quickly for those evaluating {DTProductName}, giving demonstrations, or using {JaegerName} in a test environment. If you plan to use {JaegerName} in production, you must install and configure a persistent storage option, in this case, Elasticsearch.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the {product-title} web console.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

[WARNING]
====
Do not install Community versions of the Operators. Community Operators are not supported.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you have already installed the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator as part of OpenShift Logging, you do not need to install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator again. The {JaegerName} Operator creates the Elasticsearch instance using the installed OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Type *Elasticsearch* into the filter box to locate the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.

. Click the *OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator* provided by Red Hat to display information about the Operator.

. Click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page, select the *stable* Update Channel. This automatically updates your Operator as new versions are released.

. Accept the default *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*. This installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators-redhat` project and makes the Operator available to all projects in the cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Elasticsearch installation requires the *openshift-operators-redhat* namespace for the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator. The other {DTProductName} Operators are installed in the `openshift-operators` namespace.
====
+

. Accept the default *Automatic* approval strategy. By accepting the default, when a new version of this Operator is available, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention. If you select *Manual* updates, when a newer version of an Operator is available, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the Operator updated to the new version.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Manual* approval strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator install and subscription process.
====

. Click *Install*.

. On the *Installed Operators* page, select the `openshift-operators-redhat` project. Wait until you see that the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator shows a status of "InstallSucceeded" before continuing.

[id="distr-tracing-jaeger-operator-install_{context}"]
= Installing the {JaegerName} Operator

To install {JaegerName}, you use the link:https://operatorhub.io/[OperatorHub] to install the {JaegerName} Operator.

By default, the Operator is installed in the `openshift-operators` project.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the {product-title} web console.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* If you require persistent storage, you must also install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator before installing the {JaegerName} Operator.

[WARNING]
====
Do not install Community versions of the Operators. Community Operators are not supported.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Type *distributed tracing platform* into the filter to locate the {JaegerName} Operator.

. Click the *{JaegerName} Operator* provided by Red Hat to display information about the Operator.

. Click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page, select the *stable* Update Channel. This automatically updates your Operator as new versions are released.
//If you select a maintenance channel, for example, *Stable*, you will receive bug fixes and security patches for the length of the support cycle for that version.

. Accept the default *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*. This installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` project and makes the Operator available to all projects in the cluster.

* Accept the default *Automatic* approval strategy. By accepting the default, when a new version of this Operator is available, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention.

. Click *Install*.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. On the *Installed Operators* page, select the `openshift-operators` project. Wait until you see that the {JaegerName} Operator shows a status of "Succeeded" before continuing.
