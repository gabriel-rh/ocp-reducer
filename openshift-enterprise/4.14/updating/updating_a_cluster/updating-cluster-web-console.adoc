WARNING: This assembly has been moved into a subdirectory for 4.14+. Changes to this assembly for earlier versions should be done in separate PRs based off of their respective version branches. Otherwise, your cherry picks may fail.

You can update, or upgrade, an {product-title} cluster by using the web console. The following steps update a cluster within a minor version. You can use the same instructions for updating a cluster between minor versions.

[NOTE]
====
Use the web console or `oc adm upgrade channel _<channel>_` to change the update channel. You can follow the steps in xref:../../updating/updating_a_cluster/updating-cluster-cli.adoc#updating-cluster-cli[Updating a cluster using the CLI] to complete the update after you change to a {product-version} channel.
====

== Prerequisites

* Have access to the cluster as a user with `admin` privileges.
See xref:../../authentication/using-rbac.adoc#using-rbac[Using RBAC to define and apply permissions].
* Have a recent xref:../../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backup-etcd[etcd backup] in case your update fails and you must restore your cluster to a previous state.
* Support for {op-system-base}7 workers is removed in {product-title} {product-version}. You must replace {op-system-base}7 workers with {op-system-base}8 or {op-system} workers before updating to {product-title} {product-version}. Red Hat does not support in-place {op-system-base}7 to {op-system-base}8 updates for {op-system-base} workers; those hosts must be replaced with a clean operating system install.
* Ensure all Operators previously installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) are updated to their latest version in their latest channel. Updating the Operators ensures they have a valid update path when the default OperatorHub catalogs switch from the current minor version to the next during a cluster update. See xref:../../operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.adoc#olm-upgrading-operators[Updating installed Operators] for more information.
* Ensure that all machine config pools (MCPs) are running and not paused. Nodes associated with a paused MCP are skipped during the update process. You can pause the MCPs if you are performing a canary rollout update strategy.
//remove this???^ or maybe just add another bullet that you can break up the update?
* To accommodate the time it takes to update, you are able to do a partial update by updating the worker or custom pool nodes. You can pause and resume within the progress bar of each pool.
* If your cluster uses manually maintained credentials, update the cloud provider resources for the new release. For more information, including how to determine if this is a requirement for your cluster, see xref:../../updating/preparing_for_updates/preparing-manual-creds-update.adoc#preparing-manual-creds-update[Preparing to update a cluster with manually maintained credentials].
* Review the list of APIs that were removed in Kubernetes 1.27, migrate any affected components to use the new API version, and provide the administrator acknowledgment. For more information, see xref:../../updating/preparing_for_updates/updating-cluster-prepare.adoc#updating-cluster-prepare[Preparing to update to {product-title} 4.14].
* If you run an Operator or you have configured any application with the pod disruption budget, you might experience an interruption during the update process. If `minAvailable` is set to 1 in `PodDisruptionBudget`, the nodes are drained to apply pending machine configs which might block the eviction process. If several nodes are rebooted, all the pods might run on only one node, and the `PodDisruptionBudget` field can prevent the node drain.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* When an update is failing to complete, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) reports the status of any blocking components while attempting to reconcile the update. Rolling your cluster back to a previous version is not supported.  If your update is failing to complete, contact Red Hat support.
* Using the `unsupportedConfigOverrides` section to modify the configuration of an Operator is unsupported and might block cluster updates. You must remove this setting before you can update your cluster.

[id="update-using-custom-machine-config-pools-canary_{context}"]
= Performing a canary rollout update

In some specific use cases, you might want a more controlled update process where you do not want specific nodes updated concurrently with the rest of the cluster. These use cases include, but are not limited to:

* You have mission-critical applications that you do not want unavailable during the update. You can slowly test the applications on your nodes in small batches after the update.
* You have a small maintenance window that does not allow the time for all nodes to be updated, or you have multiple maintenance windows.

The rolling update process is *not* a typical update workflow. With larger clusters, it can be a time-consuming process that requires you execute multiple commands. This complexity can result in errors that can affect the entire cluster.  It is recommended that you carefully consider whether your organization wants to use a rolling update and carefully plan the implementation of the process before you start.

The rolling update process described in this topic involves:

* Creating one or more custom machine config pools (MCPs).
* Labeling each node that you do not want to  update immediately to move those nodes to the custom MCPs.
* Pausing those custom MCPs, which prevents updates to those nodes.
* Performing the cluster update.
* Unpausing one custom MCP, which triggers the update on those nodes.
* Testing the applications on those nodes to make sure the applications work as expected on those newly-updated nodes.
* Optionally removing the custom labels from the remaining nodes in small batches and testing the applications on those nodes.

//The following wording comes from https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/34704, not yet finalized

[NOTE]
====
Pausing an MCP should be done with careful consideration and for short periods of time only.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="machine-health-checks-pausing-web-console_{context}"]
= Pausing a MachineHealthCheck resource by using the web console

During the update process, nodes in the cluster might become temporarily unavailable. In the case of worker nodes, the machine health check might identify such nodes as unhealthy and reboot them. To avoid rebooting such nodes, pause all the `MachineHealthCheck` resources before updating the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have access to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.
. Navigate to *Compute* -> *MachineHealthChecks*.
. To pause the machine health checks, add the `cluster.x-k8s.io/paused=""` annotation to each `MachineHealthCheck` resource. For example, to add the annotation to the `machine-api-termination-handler` resource, complete the following steps:
.. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to the `machine-api-termination-handler` and click *Edit annotations*.
.. In the *Edit annotations* dialog, click *Add more*.
.. In the *Key* and *Value* fields, add `cluster.x-k8s.io/paused` and `""` values, respectively, and click *Save*.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="update-single-node-openshift_{context}"]
= About updating single node {product-title}

You can update, or upgrade, a single-node {product-title} cluster by using either the console or CLI.

However, note the following limitations:

* The prerequisite to pause the `MachineHealthCheck` resources is not required because there is no other node to perform the health check.

* Restoring a single-node {product-title} cluster using an etcd backup is not officially supported. However, it is good practice to perform the etcd backup in case your update fails. If your control plane is healthy, you might be able to restore your cluster to a previous state by using the backup.

* Updating a single-node {product-title} cluster requires downtime and can include an automatic reboot. The amount of downtime depends on the update payload, as described in the following scenarios:

** If the update payload contains an operating system update, which requires a reboot, the downtime is significant and impacts cluster management and user workloads.

** If the update contains machine configuration changes that do not require a reboot, the downtime is less, and the impact on the cluster management and user workloads is lessened. In this case, the node draining step is skipped with single-node {product-title} because there is no other node in the cluster to reschedule the workloads to.

** If the update payload does not contain an operating system update or machine configuration changes, a short API outage occurs and resolves quickly.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There are conditions, such as bugs in an updated package, that can cause the single node to not restart after a reboot. In this case, the update does not rollback automatically.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="update-upgrading-web_{context}"]
= Updating a cluster by using the web console

If updates are available, you can update your cluster from the web console.

You can find information about available {product-title} advisories and updates
link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290[in the errata section] of the Customer Portal.

.Prerequisites

* Have access to the web console as a user with `admin` privileges.
* Pause all `MachineHealthCheck` resources.

.Procedure

. From the web console, click *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings* and review the contents of the *Details* tab.

. For production clusters, ensure that the *Channel* is set to the correct channel for the version that you want to update to, such as `stable-{product-version}`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For production clusters, you must subscribe to a `stable-\*`, `eus-*` or `fast-*` channel.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
When you are ready to move to the next minor version, choose the channel that corresponds to that minor version.
The sooner the update channel is declared, the more effectively the cluster can recommend update paths to your target version.
The cluster might take some time to evaluate all the possible updates that are available and offer the best update recommendations to choose from.
Update recommendations can change over time, as they are based on what update options are available at the time.

If you cannot see an update path to your target minor version, keep updating your cluster to the latest patch release for your current version until the next minor version is available in the path.
====
** If the *Update status* is not *Updates available*, you cannot update your cluster.
** *Select channel* indicates the cluster version that your cluster is running or is updating to.

. Select a version to update to, and click *Save*.
+
The Input channel
*Update status* changes to *Update to <product-version> in progress*, and you can review the progress of the cluster update by watching the progress bars for the Operators and nodes.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are update your cluster to the next minor version, like version 4.y to 4.(y+1), it is recommended to confirm your nodes are updated before deploying workloads that rely on a new feature. Any pools with worker nodes that are not yet updated are displayed on the *Cluster Settings* page.
====

. After the update completes and the Cluster Version Operator refreshes the available updates, check if more updates are available in your current channel.
+
--
** If updates are available, continue to perform updates in the current channel until you can no longer update.
** If no updates are available, change the *Channel* to the `stable-\*`, `eus-*` or `fast-*` channel for the next minor version, and update to the version that you want in that channel.
--
+
You might need to perform several intermediate updates until you reach the version that you want.

[id="update-changing-update-server-web_{context}"]
= Changing the update server by using the web console
Changing the update server is optional. If you have an OpenShift Update Service (OSUS) installed and configured locally, you must set the URL for the server as the `upstream` to use the local server during updates.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings*, click *version*.
. Click the *YAML* tab and then edit the `upstream` parameter value:
+
.Example output
+

    clusterID: db93436d-7b05-42cc-b856-43e11ad2d31a
    upstream: '<update-server-url>' <1>
  ...
----
<1> The `<update-server-url>` variable specifies the URL for the update server.
+
The default `upstream` is `\https://api.openshift.com/api/upgrades_info/v1/graph`.

. Click *Save*.
