You must mirror container images onto a mirror registry before you can update a cluster in a disconnected environment. You can also use this procedure in connected environments to ensure your clusters run only approved container images that have satisfied your organizational controls for external content.

[NOTE]
====
Your mirror registry must be running at all times while the cluster is running.
====

The following steps outline the high-level workflow on how to mirror images to a mirror registry:

. Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) on all devices being used to retrieve and push release images.

. Download the registry pull secret and add it to your cluster.

. If you use the xref:../../../updating/updating_a_cluster/updating_disconnected_cluster/mirroring-image-repository.adoc#mirroring-ocp-resources-ocmirror[oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin]:

.. Install the oc-mirror plugin on all devices being used to retrieve and push release images.

.. Create an image set configuration file for the plugin to use when determining which release images to mirror. You can edit this configuration file later to change which release images that the plugin mirrors.

.. Mirror your targeted release images directly to a mirror registry, or to removable media and then to a mirror registry.

.. Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by the oc-mirror plugin.

.. Repeat these steps as needed to update your mirror registry.

. If you use the xref:../../../updating/updating_a_cluster/updating_disconnected_cluster/mirroring-image-repository.adoc#update-mirror-repository-adm-release-mirror_mirroring-ocp-image-repository[`oc adm release mirror` command]:

.. Set environment variables that correspond to your environment and the release images you want to mirror.

.. Mirror your targeted release images directly to a mirror registry, or to removable media and then to a mirror registry.

.. Repeat these steps as needed to update your mirror registry.

Compared to using the `oc adm release mirror` command, the oc-mirror plugin has the following advantages:

* It can mirror content other than container images.

* After mirroring images for the first time, it is easier to update images in the registry.

* The oc-mirror plugin provides an automated way to mirror the release payload from Quay, and also builds the latest graph data image for the OpenShift Update Service running in the disconnected environment.

[id="prerequisites_updating-mirroring-disconnected"]
== Prerequisites

* You must have a container image registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2[Docker v2-2] in the location that will host the {product-title} cluster, such as Red Hat Quay.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you use Red Hat Quay, you must use version 3.6 or later with the oc-mirror plugin. If you have an entitlement to Red Hat Quay, see the documentation on deploying Red Hat Quay link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3.6/html/deploy_red_hat_quay_for_proof-of-concept_non-production_purposes/[for proof-of-concept purposes] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3.6/html/deploy_red_hat_quay_on_openshift_with_the_quay_operator/[by using the Quay Operator]. If you need additional assistance selecting and installing a registry, contact your sales representative or Red Hat Support.
====
+
If you do not have an existing solution for a container image registry, the xref:../../../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-creating-registry.adoc#installing-mirroring-creating-registry[mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift] is included in {product-title} subscriptions. The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is a small-scale container registry that you can use to mirror {product-title} container images in disconnected installations and updates.

[id="updating-restricted-network-mirror-host"]
== Preparing your mirror host

Before you perform the mirror procedure, you must prepare the host to retrieve content and push it to the remote location.

[id="installation-adding-registry-pull-secret_{context}"]
= Configuring credentials that allow images to be mirrored

Create a container image registry credentials file that allows mirroring
images from Red Hat to your mirror.

[WARNING]
====
Do not use this image registry credentials file as the pull secret when you install a cluster. If you provide this file when you install cluster, all of the machines in the cluster will have write access to your mirror registry.
====

[WARNING]
====
This process requires that you have write access to a container image registry on the mirror registry and adds the credentials to a registry pull secret.
====


.Prerequisites
* You configured a mirror registry to use in your disconnected environment.
* You identified an image repository location on your mirror registry to mirror images into.
* You provisioned a mirror registry account that allows images to be uploaded to that image repository.

.Procedure

Complete the following steps on the installation host:

. Download your `registry.redhat.io` {cluster-manager-url-pull}.

. Make a copy of your pull secret in JSON format:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat ./pull-secret | jq . > <path>/<pull_secret_file_in_json> <1>
----
<1> Specify the path to the folder to store the pull secret in and a name for the JSON file that you create.
+
The contents of the file resemble the following example:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "auths": {
    "cloud.openshift.com": {
      "auth": "b3BlbnNo...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "quay.io": {
      "auth": "b3BlbnNo...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "registry.connect.redhat.com": {
      "auth": "NTE3Njg5Nj...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "registry.redhat.io": {
      "auth": "NTE3Njg5Nj...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    }
  }
}
----
// An additional step for following this procedure when using oc-mirror as part of the disconnected install process.
// Similar to the additional step above, except it is framed as optional because it is included in a disconnected update page (where users may or may not use oc-mirror for their process)
. Optional: If using the oc-mirror plugin, save the file either as `~/.docker/config.json` or `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json`.

. Generate the base64-encoded user name and password or token for your mirror registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo -n '<user_name>:<password>' | base64 -w0 <1>
BGVtbYk3ZHAtqXs=
----
<1> For `<user_name>` and `<password>`, specify the user name and password that you configured for your registry.

. Edit the JSON
file and add a section that describes your registry to it:
+
[source,json]
----
  "auths": {
    "<mirror_registry>": { <1>
      "auth": "<credentials>", <2>
      "email": "you@example.com"
    }
  },
----
<1> For `<mirror_registry>`, specify the registry domain name, and optionally the
port, that your mirror registry uses to serve content. For example,
`registry.example.com` or `registry.example.com:8443`
<2> For `<credentials>`, specify the base64-encoded user name and password for
the mirror registry.
+
The file resembles the following example:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "auths": {
    "registry.example.com": {
      "auth": "BGVtbYk3ZHAtqXs=",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "cloud.openshift.com": {

== Mirroring resources using the oc-mirror plugin

You can use the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin to mirror images to a mirror registry in your fully or partially disconnected environments. You must run oc-mirror from a system with internet connectivity to download the required images from the official Red Hat registries.

// About the oc-mirror plugin
:leveloffset: +2

// Module included in the following assemblies:

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="installation-oc-mirror-about_{context}"]
= About the oc-mirror plugin

You can use the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin to mirror all required {product-title} content and other images to your mirror registry by using a single tool. It provides the following features:

* Provides a centralized method to mirror {product-title} releases, Operators, helm charts, and other images.
* Maintains update paths for {product-title} and Operators.
* Uses a declarative image set configuration file to include only the {product-title} releases, Operators, and images that your cluster needs.
* Performs incremental mirroring, which reduces the size of future image sets.
* Prunes images from the target mirror registry that were excluded from the image set configuration since the previous execution.
* Optionally generates supporting artifacts for OpenShift Update Service (OSUS) usage.

When using the oc-mirror plugin, you specify which content to mirror in an image set configuration file. In this YAML file, you can fine-tune the configuration to only include the {product-title} releases and Operators that your cluster needs. This reduces the amount of data that you need to download and transfer. The oc-mirror plugin can also mirror arbitrary helm charts and additional container images to assist users in seamlessly synchronizing their workloads onto mirror registries.

The first time you run the oc-mirror plugin, it populates your mirror registry with the required content to perform your disconnected cluster installation or update. In order for your disconnected cluster to continue receiving updates, you must keep your mirror registry updated. To update your mirror registry, you run the oc-mirror plugin using the same configuration as the first time you ran it. The oc-mirror plugin references the metadata from the storage backend and only downloads what has been released since the last time you ran the tool. This provides update paths for {product-title} and Operators and performs dependency resolution as required.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using the oc-mirror CLI plugin to populate a mirror registry, any further updates to the mirror registry must be made using the oc-mirror tool.

= oc-mirror compatibility and support

The oc-mirror plugin supports mirroring {product-title} payload images and Operator catalogs for {product-title} versions 4.10 and later.

[NOTE]
====
On `aarch64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures the oc-mirror plugin is only supported for {product-title} versions 4.14 and later.
====

Use the latest available version of the oc-mirror plugin regardless of which versions of {product-title} you need to mirror.

// TODO: Remove this in 4.14
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you used the Technology Preview OCI local catalogs feature for the oc-mirror plugin for {product-title} 4.12, you can no longer use the OCI local catalogs feature of the oc-mirror plugin to copy a catalog locally and convert it to OCI format as a first step to mirroring to a fully disconnected cluster.

= About the mirror registry

You can mirror the images that are required for {product-title} installation and subsequent product updates to a container mirror registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2[Docker v2-2], such as Red Hat Quay. If you do not have access to a large-scale container registry, you can use the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_, which is a small-scale container registry included with {product-title} subscriptions.

Regardless of your chosen registry, the procedure to mirror content from Red Hat hosted sites on the internet to an isolated image registry is the same. After you mirror the content, you configure each cluster to retrieve this content from your mirror registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {product-registry} cannot be used as the target registry because it does not support pushing without a tag, which is required during the mirroring process.
====

If choosing a container registry that is not the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_, it must be reachable by every machine in the clusters that you provision. If the registry is unreachable, installation, updating, or normal operations such as workload relocation might fail. For that reason, you must run mirror registries in a highly available way, and the mirror registries must at least match the production availability of your {product-title} clusters.

When you populate your mirror registry with {product-title} images, you can follow two scenarios. If you have a host that can access both the internet and your mirror registry, but not your cluster nodes, you can directly mirror the content from that machine. This process is referred to as _connected mirroring_. If you have no such host, you must mirror the images to a file system and then bring that host or removable media into your restricted environment. This process is referred to as _disconnected mirroring_.

For mirrored registries, to view the source of pulled images, you must review the `Trying to access` log entry in the CRI-O logs. Other methods to view the image pull source, such as using the `crictl images` command on a node, show the non-mirrored image name, even though the image is pulled from the mirrored location.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not test third party registries with {product-title}.

= Creating the image set configuration

Before you can use the oc-mirror plugin to mirror image sets, you must create an image set configuration file. This image set configuration file defines which {product-title} releases, Operators, and other images to mirror, along with other configuration settings for the oc-mirror plugin.

You must specify a storage backend in the image set configuration file. This storage backend can be a local directory or a registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2[Docker v2-2]. The oc-mirror plugin stores metadata in this storage backend during image set creation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not delete or modify the metadata that is generated by the oc-mirror plugin. You must use the same storage backend every time you run the oc-mirror plugin for the same mirror registry.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have created a container image registry credentials file. For instructions, see _Configuring credentials that allow images to be mirrored_.

.Procedure

. Use the `oc mirror init` command to create a template for the image set configuration and save it to a file called `imageset-config.yaml`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror init --registry example.com/mirror/oc-mirror-metadata > imageset-config.yaml <1>

=== Keeping your mirror registry content updated

After you populate your target mirror registry with the initial image set, you must update it regularly so that it has the latest content. If possible, you can set up a cron job to update the mirror registry on a regular basis.

Update your image set configuration to add or remove {product-title} and Operator releases as necessary. Removed images are pruned from the mirror registry.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="oc-mirror-updating-registry-about_{context}"]
= About updating your mirror registry content

When you run the oc-mirror plugin again, it generates an image set that only contains new and updated images since the previous execution. Because it only pulls in the differences since the previous image set was created, the generated image set is often smaller and faster to process than the initial image set.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Generated image sets are sequential and must be pushed to the target mirror registry in order. You can derive the sequence number from the file name of the generated image set archive file.
====

[discrete]
== Adding new and updated images

Depending on the settings in your image set configuration, future executions of oc-mirror can mirror additional new and updated images. Review the settings in your image set configuration to ensure that you are retrieving new versions as necessary. For example, you can set the minimum and maximum versions of Operators to mirror if you want to restrict to specific versions. Alternatively, you can set the minimum version as a starting point to mirror, but keep the version range open so you keep receiving new Operator versions on future executions of oc-mirror. Omitting any minimum or maximum version gives you the full version history of an Operator in a channel. Omitting explicitly named channels gives you all releases in all channels of the specified Operator. Omitting any named Operator gives you the entire catalog of all Operators and all their versions ever released.

All these constraints and conditions are evaluated against the publicly released content by Red Hat on every invocation of oc-mirror. This way, it automatically picks up new releases and entirely new Operators. Constraints can be specified by only listing a desired set of Operators, which will not automatically add other newly released Operators into the mirror set. You can also specify a particular release channel, which limits mirroring to just this channel and not any new channels that have been added. This is important for Operator products, such as Red Hat Quay, that use different release channels for their minor releases. Lastly, you can specify a maximum version of a particular Operator, which causes the tool to only mirror the specified version range so that you do not automatically get any newer releases past the maximum version mirrored. In all these cases, you must update the image set configuration file to broaden the scope of the mirroring of Operators to get other Operators, new channels, and newer versions of Operators to be available in your target registry.

It is recommended to align constraints like channel specification or version ranges with the release strategy that a particular Operator has chosen. For example, when the Operator uses a `stable` channel, you should restrict mirroring to that channel and potentially a minimum version to find the right balance between download volume and getting stable updates regularly. If the Operator chooses a release version channel scheme, for example `stable-3.7`, you should mirror all releases in that channel. This allows you to keep receiving patch versions of the Operator, for example `3.7.1`. You can also regularly adjust the image set configuration to add channels for new product releases, for example `stable-3.8`.

[discrete]
== Pruning images

Images are pruned automatically from the target mirror registry if they are no longer included in the latest image set that was generated and mirrored. This allows you to easily manage and clean up unneeded content and reclaim storage resources.

If there are {product-title} releases or Operator versions that you no longer need, you can modify your image set configuration to exclude them, and they will be pruned from the mirror registry upon mirroring. This can be done by adjusting a minimum or maximum version range setting per Operator in the image set configuration file or by deleting the Operator from the list of Operators to mirror from the catalog. You can also remove entire Operator catalogs or entire {product-title} releases from the configuration file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If there are no new or updated images to mirror, the excluded images are not pruned from the target mirror registry. Additionally, if an Operator publisher removes an Operator version from a channel, the removed versions are pruned from the target mirror registry.
====

To disable automatic pruning of images from the target mirror registry, pass the `--skip-pruning` flag to the `oc mirror` command.

= Updating your mirror registry content

After you publish the initial image set to the mirror registry, you can use the oc-mirror plugin to keep your disconnected clusters updated.

Depending on your image set configuration, oc-mirror automatically detects newer releases of {product-title} and your selected Operators that have been released after you completed the inital mirror. It is recommended to run oc-mirror at regular intervals, for example in a nightly cron job, to receive product and security updates on a timely basis.

.Prerequisites

* You have used the oc-mirror plugin to mirror the initial image set to your mirror registry.
* You have access to the storage backend that was used for the initial execution of the oc-mirror plugin.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must use the same storage backend as the initial execution of oc-mirror for the same mirror registry. Do not delete or modify the metadata image that is generated by the oc-mirror plugin.
====

.Procedure

. If necessary, update your image set configuration file to pick up new {product-title} and Operator versions. See _Image set configuration examples_ for example mirroring use cases.

. Follow the same steps that you used to mirror your initial image set to the mirror registry. For instructions, see _Mirroring an image set in a partially disconnected environment_ or _Mirroring an image set in a fully disconnected environment_.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
* You must provide the same storage backend so that only a differential image set is created and mirrored.
* If you specified a top-level namespace for the mirror registry during the initial image set creation, then you must use this same namespace every time you run the oc-mirror plugin for the same mirror registry.

= Performing a dry run

You can use oc-mirror to perform a dry run, without actually mirroring any images. This allows you to review the list of images that would be mirrored, as well as any images that would be pruned from the mirror registry. It also allows you to catch any errors with your image set configuration early or use the generated list of images with other tools to carry out the mirroring operation.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have installed the `oc-mirror` CLI plugin.
* You have created the image set configuration file.

.Procedure

. Run the `oc mirror` command with the `--dry-run` flag to perform a dry run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror --config=./imageset-config.yaml \// <1>
  docker://registry.example:5000            \// <2>
  --dry-run                                  <3>
----
<1> Pass in the image set configuration file that was created. This procedure assumes that it is named `imageset-config.yaml`.
<2> Specify the mirror registry. Nothing is mirrored to this registry as long as you use the `--dry-run` flag.
<3> Use the `--dry-run` flag to generate the dry run artifacts and not an actual image set file.

= Including local OCI Operator catalogs

While mirroring {product-title} releases, Operator catalogs, and additional images from a registry to a partially disconnected cluster, you can include Operator catalog images from a local file-based catalog on disk. The local catalog must be in the Open Container Initiative (OCI) format.

The local catalog and its contents are mirrored to your target mirror registry based on the filtering information in the image set configuration file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When mirroring local OCI catalogs, any {product-title} releases or additional images that you want to mirror along with the local OCI-formatted catalog must be pulled from a registry.

You cannot mirror OCI catalogs along with an oc-mirror image set file on disk.
====

One example use case for using the OCI feature is if you have a CI/CD system building an OCI catalog to a location on disk, and you want to mirror that OCI catalog along with an {product-title} release to your mirror registry.

[NOTE]
====
If you used the Technology Preview OCI local catalogs feature for the oc-mirror plugin for {product-title} 4.12, you can no longer use the OCI local catalogs feature of the oc-mirror plugin to copy a catalog locally and convert it to OCI format as a first step to mirroring to a fully disconnected cluster.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have installed the `oc-mirror` CLI plugin.

.Procedure

. Create the image set configuration file and adjust the settings as necessary.
+
The following example image set configuration mirrors an OCI catalog on disk along with an {product-title} release and a UBI image from `registry.redhat.io`.

<4> Optionally, specify an alternative namespace and name to mirror the catalog as.
<5> Optionally, specify additional Operator catalogs to pull from a registry.
<6> Optionally, specify additional images to pull from a registry.

<2> Specify the registry to mirror the content to. The registry must start with `docker://`. If you specify a top-level namespace for the mirror registry, you must also use this same namespace on subsequent executions.
+
Optionally, you can specify other flags to adjust the behavior of the OCI feature:
+
`--oci-insecure-signature-policy`:: Do not push signatures to the target mirror registry.
+
`--oci-registries-config`:: Specify the path to a TOML-formatted `registries.conf` file. You can use this to mirror from a different registry, such as a pre-production location for testing, without having to change the image set configuration file. This flag only affects local OCI catalogs, not any other mirrored content.

[NOTE]
====
Using the `minVersion` and `maxVersion` properties to filter for a specific Operator version range can result in a multiple channel heads error. The error message will state that there are `multiple channel heads`. This is because when the filter is applied, the update graph of the operator is truncated.

The Operator Lifecycle Manager requires that every operator channel contains versions that form an update graph with exactly one end point, that is, the latest version of the operator. When applying the filter range that graph can turn into two or more separate graphs or a graph that has more than one end point.

To avoid this error, do not filter out the latest version of an operator. If you still run into the error, depending on the operator, either the `maxVersion` property needs to be increased or the `minVersion` property needs to be decreased. Because every operator graph can be different, you might need to adjust these values, according to the procedure, until the error is gone.

The following `ImageSetConfiguration` file uses a registry storage backend and includes all {product-title} versions starting at a minimum version of `4.13.4` to the latest version in the channel. On every invocation of oc-mirror with this image set configuration, the latest release of the `stable-4.13` channel is evaluated, so running oc-mirror at regular intervals ensures that you automatically receive the latest releases of {product-title} images.

By setting the value of `platform.architectures` to `multi`, you can ensure that the mirroring is supported for multi-architecture releases.

== Use case: Including Operator versions from a minimum to the latest

The following `ImageSetConfiguration` file uses a local storage backend and includes only the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes Operator, versions starting at 4.0.1 and later in the `stable` channel.

[NOTE]
====
When you specify a minimum or maximum version range, you might not receive all Operator versions in that range.

By default, oc-mirror excludes any versions that are skipped or replaced by a newer version in the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) specification. Operator versions that are skipped might be affected by a CVE or contain bugs. Use a newer version instead. For more information on skipped and replaced versions, see link:https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/concepts/olm-architecture/operator-catalog/creating-an-update-graph/[Creating an update graph with OLM].

To receive all Operator versions in a specified range, you can set the `mirror.operators.full` field to `true`.

The following `ImageSetConfiguration` file includes the `stable-5.7` and `stable` channels for the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator. Even if only the packages from the `stable-5.7` channel are needed, the `stable` channel must also be included in the `ImageSetConfiguration` file, because it is the default channel for the Operator. You must always include the default channel for the Operator package even if you do not use the bundles in that channel.

.oc mirror flags
[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|Flag
|Description

|`-c`, `--config` `<string>`
|Specify the path to an image set configuration file.

|`--continue-on-error`
|If any non image-pull related error occurs, continue and attempt to mirror as much as possible.

|`--dest-skip-tls`
|Disable TLS validation for the target registry.

|`--dest-use-http`
|Use plain HTTP for the target registry.

|`--dry-run`
|Print actions without mirroring images. Generates `mapping.txt` and `pruning-plan.json` files.

|`--from <string>`
|Specify the path to an image set archive that was generated by an execution of oc-mirror to load into a target registry.

|`-h`, `--help`
|Show the help.

|`--ignore-history`
|Ignore past mirrors when downloading images and packing layers. Disables incremental mirroring and might download more data.

|`--manifests-only`
|Generate manifests for `ImageContentSourcePolicy` objects to configure a cluster to use the mirror registry, but do not actually mirror any images. To use this flag, you must pass in an image set archive with the `--from` flag.

|`--max-nested-paths <int>`
|Specify the maximum number of nested paths for destination registries that limit nested paths. The default is `0`.

|`--max-per-registry <int>`
|Specify the number of concurrent requests allowed per registry. The default is `6`.

|`--oci-insecure-signature-policy`
|Do not push signatures when mirroring local OCI catalogs (with `--include-local-oci-catalogs`).

|`--oci-registries-config`
|Provide a registries configuration file to specify an alternative registry location to copy from when mirroring local OCI catalogs (with `--include-local-oci-catalogs`).

|`--skip-cleanup`
|Skip removal of artifact directories.

|`--skip-image-pin`
|Do not replace image tags with digest pins in Operator catalogs.

|`--skip-metadata-check`
|Skip metadata when publishing an image set. This is only recommended when the image set was created with `--ignore-history`.

|`--skip-missing`
|If an image is not found, skip it instead of reporting an error and aborting execution. Does not apply to custom images explicitly specified in the image set configuration.

|`--skip-pruning`
|Disable automatic pruning of images from the target mirror registry.

|`--skip-verification`
|Skip digest verification.

|`--source-skip-tls`
|Disable TLS validation for the source registry.

|`--source-use-http`
|Use plain HTTP for the source registry.

|`-v`, `--verbose` `<int>`
|Specify the number for the log level verbosity. Valid values are `0` - `9`. The default is `0`.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="update-mirror-repository-adm-release-mirror_{context}"]
= Mirroring images using the oc adm release mirror command

[IMPORTANT]
====
To avoid excessive memory usage by the OpenShift Update Service application, you must mirror release images to a separate repository as described in the following procedure.
====

.Prerequisites

* You configured a mirror registry to use in your disconnected environment and can access the certificate and credentials that you configured.
* You downloaded the {cluster-manager-url-pull} and modified it to include authentication to your mirror repository.
* If you use self-signed certificates, you have specified a Subject Alternative Name in the certificates.

.Procedure

. Use the link:https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocpupgradegraph/update_channel[Red Hat {product-title} Update Graph visualizer and update planner] to plan an update from one version to another. The OpenShift Update Graph provides channel graphs and a way to confirm that there is an update path between your current and intended cluster versions.

. Set the required environment variables:
.. Export the release version:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export OCP_RELEASE=<release_version>
----
+
For `<release_version>`, specify the tag that corresponds to the version of {product-title} to which you want to update, such as `4.5.4`.

.. Export the local registry name and host port:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_REGISTRY='<local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>'
----
+
For `<local_registry_host_name>`, specify the registry domain name for your mirror
repository, and for `<local_registry_host_port>`, specify the port that it
serves content on.

.. Export the local repository name:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_REPOSITORY='<local_repository_name>'
----
+
For `<local_repository_name>`, specify the name of the repository to create in your
registry, such as `ocp4/openshift4`.

.. If you are using the OpenShift Update Service, export an additional local repository name to contain the release images:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_RELEASE_IMAGES_REPOSITORY='<local_release_images_repository_name>'
----
+
For `<local_release_images_repository_name>`, specify the name of the repository to
create in your registry, such as `ocp4/openshift4-release-images`.

.. Export the name of the repository to mirror:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ PRODUCT_REPO='openshift-release-dev'
----
+
For a production release, you must specify `openshift-release-dev`.

.. Export the path to your registry pull secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_SECRET_JSON='<path_to_pull_secret>'
----
+
For `<path_to_pull_secret>`, specify the absolute path to and file name of the pull secret for your mirror registry that you created.
+
[NOTE]
====
If your cluster uses an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object to configure repository mirroring, you can use only global pull secrets for mirrored registries. You cannot add a pull secret to a project.
====

.. Export the release mirror:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ RELEASE_NAME="ocp-release"
----
+
For a production release, you must specify `ocp-release`.

.. Export the type of architecture for your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ARCHITECTURE=<cluster_architecture> <1>
----
<1> Specify the architecture of the cluster, such as `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `s390x`, or `ppc64le`.

.. Export the path to the directory to host the mirrored images:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH=<path> <1>
----
<1> Specify the full path, including the initial forward slash (/) character.

. Review the images and configuration manifests to mirror:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --to-dir=${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror quay.io/${PRODUCT_REPO}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE} --dry-run
----
. Mirror the version images to the mirror registry.
** If your mirror host does not have internet access, take the following actions:
... Connect the removable media to a system that is connected to the internet.
... Mirror the images and configuration manifests to a directory on the removable media:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --to-dir=${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror quay.io/${PRODUCT_REPO}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE}
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This command also generates and saves the mirrored release image signature config map onto the removable media.
====

... Take the media to the disconnected environment and upload the images to the local container registry.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image mirror  -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --from-dir=${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror "file://openshift/release:${OCP_RELEASE}*" ${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} <1>
----
+
<1> For `REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH`, you must use the same path that you specified when you mirrored the images.

... Use `oc` command-line interface (CLI) to log in to the cluster that you are updating.

... Apply the mirrored release image signature config map to the connected cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror/config/<image_signature_file> <1>
----
+
<1> For `<image_signature_file>`, specify the path and name of the file, for example, `signature-sha256-81154f5c03294534.yaml`.

... If you are using the OpenShift Update Service, mirror the release image to a separate repository:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} ${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE} ${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_RELEASE_IMAGES_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE}
----

** If the local container registry and the cluster are connected to the mirror host, take the following actions:

... Directly push the release images to the local registry and apply the config map  to the cluster by using following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --from=quay.io/${PRODUCT_REPO}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE} \
  --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} --apply-release-image-signature
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you include the `--apply-release-image-signature` option, do not create the config map for image signature verification.
====

... If you are using the OpenShift Update Service, mirror the release image to a separate repository:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} ${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE} ${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_RELEASE_IMAGES_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE}
----
