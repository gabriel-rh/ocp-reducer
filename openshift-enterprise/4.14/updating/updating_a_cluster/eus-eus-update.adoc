////
WARNING: This assembly has been moved into a subdirectory for 4.14+. Changes to this assembly for earlier versions should be done in separate PRs based off of their respective version branches. Otherwise, your cherry picks may fail.

To do: Remove this comment once 4.13 docs are EOL.
////

Due to fundamental Kubernetes design, all {product-title} updates between minor versions must be serialized.
You must update from {product-title} <4.y> to <4.y+1>, and then to <4.y+2>. You cannot update from {product-title} <4.y> to <4.y+2> directly.
However, administrators who want to update between two Extended Update Support (EUS) versions can do so incurring only a single reboot of non-control plane hosts.

[IMPORTANT]
====
EUS-to-EUS updates are only viable between *even-numbered minor versions* of {product-title}.
====

There are a number of caveats to consider when attempting an EUS-to-EUS update.

* EUS-to-EUS updates are only offered after updates between all versions involved have been made available in `stable` channels.
* If you encounter issues during or after updating to the odd-numbered minor version but before updating to the next even-numbered version, then remediation of those issues may require that non-control plane hosts complete the update to the odd-numbered version before moving forward.
* You can do a partial update by updating the worker or custom pool nodes to accommodate the time it takes for maintenance.
* You can complete the update process during multiple maintenance windows by pausing at intermediate steps. However, plan to complete the entire update within 60 days. This is critical to ensure that normal cluster automation processes are completed.

* Until the machine config pools are unpaused and the update is complete, some features and bugs fixes in <4.y+1> and <4.y+2> of {product-title} are not available.

* All the clusters might update using EUS channels for a conventional update without pools paused, but only clusters with non control-plane `MachineConfigPools` objects can do EUS-to-EUS update with pools paused.

// EUS-to-EUS update

// * updating/updating_a_cluster/eus-eus-update.adoc

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="updating-eus-to-eus-upgrade_{context}"]
= EUS-to-EUS update

The following procedure pauses all non-master machine config pools and performs updates from {product-title} <4.y> to <4.y+1> to <4.y+2>, then unpauses the previously paused machine config pools.
Following this procedure reduces the total update duration and the number of times worker nodes are restarted.

.Prerequisites

* Review the release notes for {product-title} <4.y+1> and <4.y+2>.
* Review the release notes and product lifecycles for any layered products and Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Operators. Some may require updates either before or during an EUS-to-EUS update.
* Ensure that you are familiar with version-specific prerequisites, such as the removal of deprecated APIs, that are required prior to updating from {product-title} <4.y+1> to <4.y+2>.
* If your cluster uses in-tree vSphere volumes, update vSphere to version 7.0u3L+ or 8.0u2+.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not update vSphere to 7.0u3L+ or 8.0u2+ before initiating an {product-title} update, known issues might occur with your cluster after the update.
For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/node/7011683[Known Issues with OpenShift 4.12 to 4.13 or 4.13 to 4.14 vSphere CSI Storage Migration].

= EUS-to-EUS update using the web console

.Prerequisites

* Verify that machine config pools are unpaused.
* Have access to the web console as a user with `admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Using the Administrator perspective on the web console, update any Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Operators to the versions that are compatible with your intended updated version. You can find more information on how to perform this action in "Updating installed Operators"; see "Additional resources".

. Verify that all machine config pools display a status of `Up to date` and that no machine config pool displays a status of `UPDATING`.
+
To view the status of all machine config pools, click *Compute* -> *MachineConfigPools* and review the contents of the *Update status* column.
+
[NOTE]
====
If your machine config pools have an `Updating` status, please wait for this status to change to `Up to date`. This process could take several minutes.
====

. Set your channel to `eus-<4.y+2>`.
+
To set your channel, click *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings* -> *Channel*. You can edit your channel by clicking on the current hyperlinked channel.

. Pause all worker machine pools except for the master pool. You can perform this action on the *MachineConfigPools* tab under the *Compute* page. Select the vertical ellipses next to the machine config pool you'd like to pause and click *Pause updates*.

. Update to version <4.y+1> and complete up to the *Save* step. You can find more information on how to perform these actions in "Updating a cluster by using the web console"; see "Additional resources".

. Ensure that the <4.y+1> updates are complete by viewing the *Last completed version* of your cluster. You can find this information on the *Cluster Settings* page under the *Details* tab.

. If necessary, update your OLM Operators by using the Administrator perspective on the web console. You can find more information on how to perform these actions in "Updating installed Operators"; see "Additional resources".

. Update to version <4.y+2> and complete up to the *Save* step. You can find more information on how to perform these actions in "Updating a cluster by using the web console"; see "Additional resources".

. Ensure that the <4.y+2> update is complete by viewing the *Last completed version* of your cluster. You can find this information on the *Cluster Settings* page under the *Details* tab.

. Unpause all previously paused machine config pools. You can perform this action on the *MachineConfigPools* tab under the *Compute* page. Select the vertical ellipses next to the machine config pool you'd like to unpause and click *Unpause updates*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If pools are paused, the cluster is not permitted to upgrade to any future minor versions, and some maintenance tasks are inhibited. This puts the cluster at risk for future degradation.
====

. Verify that your previously paused pools are updated and that your cluster has completed the update to version <4.y+2>.
+
You can verify that your pools have updated on the *MachineConfigPools* tab under the *Compute* page by confirming that the *Update status* has a value of *Up to date*.
+
You can verify that your cluster has completed the update by viewing the *Last completed version* of your cluster. You can find this information on the *Cluster Settings* page under the *Details* tab.

= EUS-to-EUS update using the CLI

.Prerequisites

* Verify that machine config pools are unpaused.
* Update the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to the target version before each update.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is highly discouraged to skip this prerequisite. If the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is not updated to the target version before your update, unexpected issues may occur.
====

.Procedure

. Using the Administrator perspective on the web console, update any Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Operators to the versions that are compatible with your intended updated version. You can find more information on how to perform this action in "Updating installed Operators"; see "Additional resources".

. Verify that all machine config pools display a status of `UPDATED` and that no machine config pool displays a status of `UPDATING`.
To view the status of all machine config pools, run the following command:

[id="updating-eus-to-eus-olm-operators_{context}"]
= EUS-to-EUS update for layered products and Operators installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager

In addition to the EUS-to-EUS update steps mentioned for the web console and CLI, there are additional steps to consider when performing EUS-to-EUS updates for clusters with the following:

* Layered products
* Operators installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

.What is a layered product?

Layered products refer to products that are made of multiple underlying products that are intended to be used together and cannot be broken into individual subscriptions. For examples of layered {product-title} products, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift/#layered[Layered Offering On OpenShift].

As you perform an EUS-to-EUS update for the clusters of layered products and those of Operators that have been installed through OLM, you must complete the following:

. Ensure that all of your Operators previously installed through OLM are updated to their latest version in their latest channel. Updating the Operators ensures that they have a valid update path when the default OperatorHub catalogs switch from the current minor version to the next during a cluster update. For information on how to update your Operators, see "Preparing for an Operator update" in "Additional resources".

. Confirm the cluster version compatibility between the current and intended Operator versions. You can verify which versions your OLM Operators are compatible with by using the link:https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocpouic/?operator=logging&&ocp_versions=4.10,4.11,4.12[Red Hat {product-title} Operator Update Information Checker].

As an example, here are the steps to perform an EUS-to-EUS update from <4.y> to <4.y+2> for OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF). This can be done through the CLI or web console. For information on how to update clusters through your desired interface, see _EUS-to-EUS update using the web console_ and "EUS-to-EUS update using the CLI" in "Additional resources".

.Example workflow
. Pause the worker machine pools.
. Update OpenShift <4.y> -> OpenShift <4.y+1>.
. Update ODF <4.y> -> ODF <4.y+1>.
. Update OpenShift <4.y+1> -> OpenShift <4.y+2>.
. Update to ODF <4.y+2>.
. Unpause the worker machine pools.

[NOTE]
====
The update to ODF <4.y+2> can happen before or after worker machine pools have been unpaused.
