toc::[]
Installing Loki is a recommended prerequisite for using the Network Observability Operator. You can choose to use xref:../network_observability/installing-operators.adoc#network-observability-without-loki_network_observability[Network Observability without Loki], but there are some considerations for doing this, described in the previously linked section.

The Loki Operator integrates a gateway that implements multi-tenancy and authentication with Loki for data flow storage. The `LokiStack` resource manages Loki, which is a scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system, and a web proxy with {product-title} authentication. The `LokiStack` proxy uses {product-title} authentication to enforce multi-tenancy and facilitate the saving and indexing of data in Loki log stores.

[NOTE]
====
The Loki Operator can also be used for xref:../logging/cluster-logging-loki.adoc#cluster-logging-loki[Logging with the LokiStack]. The Network Observability Operator requires a dedicated LokiStack separate from Logging.

= Network Observability without Loki
You can use Network Observability without Loki by not performing the Loki installation steps and skipping directly to "Installing the Network Observability Operator". If you only want to export flows to a Kafka consumer or IPFIX collector, or you only need dashboard metrics, then you do not need to install Loki or provide storage for Loki.  Without Loki, there won't be a Network Traffic panel under Observe, which means there is no overview charts, flow table, or topology. The following table compares available features with and without Loki:

The link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/openshift-logging/loki-rhel8-operator/622b46bcae289285d6fcda39[Loki Operator versions 5.7+] are the supported Loki Operator versions for Network Observabilty; these versions provide the ability to create a `LokiStack` instance using the `openshift-network` tenant configuration mode and provide fully-automatic, in-cluster authentication and authorization support for Network Observability. There are several ways you can install Loki. One way is by using the {product-title} web console Operator Hub.

.Prerequisites

* Supported Log Store (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, Swift, Minio, OpenShift Data Foundation)
* {product-title} 4.10+
* Linux Kernel 4.18+

.Procedure
. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.
. Choose  *Loki Operator* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.
. Under *Installation Mode*, select *All namespaces on the cluster*.

.Verification
. Verify that you installed the Loki Operator. Visit the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page and look for *Loki Operator*.
. Verify that *Loki Operator* is listed with *Status* as *Succeeded* in all the projects.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To uninstall Loki, refer to the uninstallation process that corresponds with the method you used to install Loki. You might have remaining `ClusterRoles` and `ClusterRoleBindings`, data stored in object store, and persistent volume that must be removed.

= Creating a secret for Loki storage
The Loki Operator supports a few log storage options, such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, Swift, Minio, OpenShift Data Foundation. The following example shows how to create a secret for AWS S3 storage. The secret created in this example, `loki-s3`, is referenced in "Creating a LokiStack resource". You can create this secret in the web console or CLI.

. Using the web console, navigate to the *Project* -> *All Projects* dropdown and select *Create Project*. Name the project `netobserv` and click *Create*.
. Navigate to the Import icon, *+*, in the top right corner. Paste your YAML file into the editor.

Querying application logs for multiple namespaces as a `cluster-admin` user, where the sum total of characters of all of the namespaces in the cluster is greater than 5120, results in the error `Parse error: input size too long (XXXX > 5120)`. For better control over access to logs in LokiStack, make the `cluster-admin` user a member of the `cluster-admin` group. If the `cluster-admin` group does not exist, create it and add the desired users to it.

= LokiStack ingestion limits and health alerts
The LokiStack instance comes with default settings according to the configured size. It is possible to override some of these settings, such as the ingestion and query limits. You might want to update them if you get Loki errors showing up in the Console plugin, or in `flowlogs-pipeline` logs. An automatic alert in the web console notifies you when these limits are reached.

Here is an example of configured limits:

[id="network-observability-multi-tenancy{context}"]
= Enabling multi-tenancy in Network Observability
Multi-tenancy in the Network Observability Operator allows and restricts individual user access, or group access, to the flows stored in Loki. Access is enabled for project admins. Project admins who have limited access to some namespaces can access flows for only those namespaces.

.Prerequisite
* You have installed link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/openshift-logging/loki-rhel8-operator/622b46bcae289285d6fcda39[Loki Operator version 5.7]
* The `FlowCollector` `spec.loki.authToken` configuration must be set to `FORWARD`.
* You must be logged in as a project administrator

.Procedure

. Authorize reading permission to `user1` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user netobserv-reader user1
----
+
Now, the data is restricted to only allowed user namespaces. For example, a user that has access to a single namespace can see all the flows internal to this namespace, as well as flows going from and to this namespace.
Project admins have access to the Administrator perspective in the {product-title} console to access the Network Flows Traffic page.

= Installing the Network Observability Operator
You can install the Network Observability Operator using the {product-title} web console Operator Hub. When you install the Operator,  it provides the `FlowCollector` custom resource definition (CRD). You can set specifications in the web console when you create the  `FlowCollector`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The actual memory consumption of the Operator depends on your cluster size and the number of resources deployed. Memory consumption might need to be adjusted accordingly. For more information refer to "Network Observability controller manager pod runs out of memory" in the "Important Flow Collector configuration considerations" section.
====

.Prerequisites

* If you choose to use Loki, install the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/openshift-logging/loki-rhel8-operator/622b46bcae289285d6fcda39[Loki Operator version 5.7+].
* You must have `cluster-admin` privileges.
* One of the following supported architectures is required: `amd64`, `ppc64le`, `arm64`, or `s390x`.
* Any CPU supported by Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.
* Must be configured with OVN-Kubernetes or OpenShift SDN as the main network plugin, and optionally using secondary interfaces, such as Multus and SR-IOV.

[NOTE]
====
This documentation assumes that your `LokiStack` instance name is `loki`. Using a different name requires additional configuration.
====

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.
. Choose  *Network Observability Operator* from the list of available Operators in the *OperatorHub*, and click *Install*.
. Select the checkbox `Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace`.
. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*. Under Provided APIs for Network Observability, select the *Flow Collector* link.
. Navigate to the *Flow Collector* tab, and click *Create FlowCollector*. Make the following selections in the form view:
.. *spec.agent.ebpf.Sampling*: Specify a sampling size for flows. Lower sampling sizes will have higher impact on resource utilization. For more information, see the "FlowCollector API reference", `spec.agent.ebpf`.
.. If you are using Loki, set the following specifications:
... *spec.loki.enable*: Select the check box to enable storing flows in Loki.

For the first part of the certificate reference names: `loki-gateway-ca-bundle`, `loki-ca-bundle`, and `loki-query-frontend-http`,`loki`, must match the name of your `LokiStack`.
.. Optional: If you are in a large-scale environment, consider configuring the `FlowCollector` with Kafka for forwarding data in a more resilient, scalable way. See "Configuring the Flow Collector resource with Kafka storage" in the "Important Flow Collector configuration considerations" section.
.. Optional: Configure other optional settings before the next step of creating the `FlowCollector`. For example, if you choose not to use Loki, then you can configure exporting flows to Kafka or IPFIX. See "Export enriched network flow data to Kafka and IPFIX" and more in the "Important Flow Collector configuration considerations" section.
.. Click *Create*.

.Verification

To confirm this was successful, when you navigate to *Observe* you should see *Network Traffic* listed in the options.

In the absence of *Application Traffic* within the {product-title} cluster, default filters might show that there are "No results", which results in no visual flow. Beside the filter selections, select *Clear all filters* to see the flow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you installed Loki using the Loki Operator, it is advised not to use `querierUrl`, as it can break the console access to Loki. If you installed Loki using another type of Loki installation, this does not apply.

[id="network-observability-kafka-option_{context}"]
= Installing Kafka (optional)
The Kafka Operator is supported for large scale environments. Kafka provides high-throughput and low-latency data feeds for forwarding network flow data in a more resilient, scalable way. You can install the Kafka Operator as link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq_streams/2.2[Red Hat AMQ Streams] from the Operator Hub, just as the Loki Operator and Network Observability Operator were installed. Refer to "Configuring the FlowCollector resource with Kafka" to configure Kafka as a storage option.

[NOTE]
====
To uninstall Kafka, refer to the uninstallation process that corresponds with the method you used to install.

[id="network-observability-operator-uninstall_{context}"]
= Uninstalling the Network Observability Operator

You can uninstall the Network Observability Operator using the {product-title} web console Operator Hub, working in the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* area.

.Procedure

. Remove the `FlowCollector` custom resource.
.. Click *Flow Collector*, which is next to the *Network Observability Operator* in the *Provided APIs* column.
.. Click the options menu {kebab} for the *cluster* and select *Delete FlowCollector*.
. Uninstall the Network Observability Operator.
.. Navigate back to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* area.
.. Click the options menu {kebab} next to the  *Network Observability Operator* and select *Uninstall Operator*.
.. *Home* -> *Projects* and select `openshift-netobserv-operator`
.. Navigate to *Actions* and select *Delete Project*
. Remove the `FlowCollector` custom resource definition (CRD).
.. Navigate to *Administration* -> *CustomResourceDefinitions*.
.. Look for *FlowCollector* and click the options menu {kebab}.
.. Select *Delete CustomResourceDefinition*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Loki Operator and Kafka remain if they were installed and must be removed separately. Additionally, you might have remaining data stored in an object store, and a persistent volume that must be removed.
