[id="network-observability-pktdrop-overview_{context}"]
= Packet drop tracking
You can configure graphical representation of network flow records with packet loss in the *Overview* view. By employing eBPF tracepoint hooks, you can gain valuable insights into packet drops for TCP, UDP, SCTP, ICMPv4, and ICMPv6 protocols, which can result in the following actions:

* Identification: Pinpoint the exact locations and network paths where packet drops are occurring. Determine whether specific devices, interfaces, or routes are more prone to drops.

* Root cause analysis: Examine the data collected by the eBPF program to understand the causes of packet drops. For example, are they a result of congestion, buffer issues, or specific network events?

* Performance optimization: With a clearer picture of packet drops, you can take steps to optimize network performance, such as adjust buffer sizes, reconfigure routing paths, or implement Quality of Service (QoS) measures.

When packet drop tracking is enabled, you can see the following metrics represented in a chart in the *Overview*.

* Top X flow dropped rates stacked
* Total dropped rate
* Top X dropped state
* Top X dropped cause
* Top X flow dropped rates stacked with total

Two kinds of packet drops are detected by Network Observability: host drops and OVS drops. Host drops are prefixed with `SKB_DROP` and OVS drops are prefixed with `OVS_DROP`. Dropped flows are shown in the side panel of the *Traffic flows* table along with a link to a description of each drop type. Examples of host drop reasons are as follows:

* `SKB_DROP_REASON_NO_SOCKET`: the packet dropped due to a missing socket.
* `SKB_DROP_REASON_TCP_CSUM`: the packet dropped due to a TCP checksum error.

Examples of OVS drops reasons are as follows:

* `OVS_DROP_LAST_ACTION`: OVS packets dropped due to an implicit drop action, for example due to a configured network policy.
* `OVS_DROP_IP_TTL`: OVS packets dropped due to an expired IP TTL.

See the _Additional Resources_ of this section for more information about enabling and working with packet drop tracking.

[id="network-observability-dns-overview_{context}"]
= DNS tracking
You can configure graphical representation of Domain Name System (DNS) tracking of network flows in the *Overview* view. Using DNS tracking with extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) tracepoint hooks can serve various purposes:

* Network Monitoring: Gain insights into DNS queries and responses, helping network administrators identify unusual patterns, potential bottlenecks, or performance issues.

* Security Analysis: Detect suspicious DNS activities, such as domain name generation algorithms (DGA) used by malware, or identify unauthorized DNS resolutions that might indicate a security breach.

* Troubleshooting: Debug DNS-related issues by tracing DNS resolution steps, tracking latency, and identifying misconfigurations.

When DNS tracking is enabled, you can see the following metrics represented in a chart in the *Overview*. See the _Additional Resources_ in this section for more information about enabling and working with this view.

* Top 5 average DNS latencies
* Top 5 DNS response code
* Top 5 DNS response code stacked with total

This feature is supported for IPv4 and IPv6 UDP protocol.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="network-observability-working-with-conversations_{context}"]
= Working with conversation tracking
As an administrator, you can you can group network flows that are part of the same conversation. A conversation is defined as a grouping of peers that are identified by their IP addresses, ports, and protocols, resulting in an unique *Conversation Id*. You can query conversation events in the web console. These events are represented in the web console as follows:

** *Conversation start*: This event happens when a connection is starting or TCP flag intercepted
** *Conversation tick*: This event happens at each specified interval defined in the `FlowCollector` `spec.processor.conversationHeartbeatInterval` parameter while the connection is active.
** *Conversation end*: This event happens when the `FlowCollector` `spec.processor.conversationEndTimeout` parameter is reached or  the TCP flag is intercepted.
** *Flow*: This is the network traffic flow that occurs within the specified interval.


.Procedure
. In the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Under the *Provided APIs* heading for the *NetObserv Operator*, select *Flow Collector*.
. Select *cluster* then select the *YAML* tab.
. Configure the `FlowCollector` custom resource so that `spec.processor.logTypes`, `conversationEndTimeout`, and `conversationHeartbeatInterval` parameters are set according to your observation needs. A sample configuration is as follows:
+
[id="network-observability-flowcollector-configuring-conversations_{context}"]
.Configure `FlowCollector` for conversation tracking
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: flows.netobserv.io/v1alpha1

metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
 processor:
  conversationEndTimeout: 10s                  <1>
  logTypes: FLOWS                              <2>
  conversationHeartbeatInterval: 30s           <3>
----
<1> The *Conversation end* event represents the point when the `conversationEndTimeout` is reached or the TCP flag is intercepted.
<2> When `logTypes` is set to `FLOWS`, only the *Flow* event is exported. If you set the value to `ALL`, both conversation and flow events are exported and visible in the *Network Traffic* page. To focus only on conversation events, you can specify `CONVERSATIONS` which exports the *Conversation start*, *Conversation tick* and *Conversation end* events; or `ENDED_CONVERSATIONS` exports only the *Conversation end* events. Storage requirements are highest for `ALL` and lowest for `ENDED_CONVERSATIONS`.
<3> The *Conversation tick* event represents each specified interval defined in the `FlowCollector` `conversationHeartbeatInterval` parameter while the network connection is active.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you update the `logType` option, the flows from the previous selection do not clear from the console plugin. For example, if you initially set `logType` to `CONVERSATIONS` for a span of time until 10 AM and then move to `ENDED_CONVERSATIONS`, the console plugin shows all conversation events before 10 AM and only ended conversations after 10 AM.
====
. Refresh the *Network Traffic* page on the *Traffic flows* tab. Notice there are two new columns, *Event/Type* and *Conversation Id*. All the *Event/Type* fields are `Flow` when *Flow* is the selected query option.
. Select *Query Options* and choose the *Log Type*, *Conversation*. Now the *Event/Type* shows all of the desired conversation events.
. Next you can filter on a specific conversation ID or switch between the *Conversation* and *Flow* log type options from the side panel.

By selecting this query option, you can choose to show duplicated flows. Duplicated flows have the same sources and destinations, including ports, and also have the same protocols, with the exception of `Interface` and `Direction` fields. Duplicates are hidden by default. Use the *Direction* filter in the *Common* section of the dropdown list to switch between ingress and egress traffic.
** *Match filters*: You can determine the relation between different filter parameters selected in the advanced filter. The available options are *Match all* and *Match any*. *Match all*  provides results that match all the values, and *Match any* provides results that match any of the values entered. The default value is *Match all*.
** *Drops filter*: You can view different levels of dropped packets with the following query options:
*** *Fully dropped* shows flow records with fully dropped packets.
*** *Containing drops* shows flow records that contain drops but can be sent.
*** *Without drops* shows records that contain sent packets.
*** *All* shows all the aforementioned records.

** *Limit*: The data limit for internal backend queries. Depending upon the matching and the filter settings, the number of traffic flow data is displayed within the specified limit.

Quick filters::
The default values in *Quick filters* drop-down menu are defined in the `FlowCollector` configuration. You can modify the options from console.

Advanced filters::
You can set the advanced filters, *Common*, *Source*, or *Destination*, by selecting the parameter to be filtered from the dropdown list. The flow data is filtered based on the selection. To enable or disable the applied filter, you can click on the applied filter listed below the filter options.

You can toggle between image:arrow-up-long-solid.png[,10] *One way* and image:arrow-up-long-solid.png[,10] image:arrow-down-long-solid.png[,10] *Back and forth* filtering. The image:arrow-up-long-solid.png[,10] *One way* filter shows only *Source* and *Destination* traffic according to your filter selections. You can use *Swap* to change the directional view of the *Source* and *Destination* traffic. The image:arrow-up-long-solid.png[,10] image:arrow-down-long-solid.png[,10] *Back and forth* filter includes return traffic with the *Source* and *Destination* filters. The directional flow of network traffic is shown in the *Direction* column in the Traffic flows table as `Ingress`or `Egress` for inter-node traffic and `Inner`for traffic inside a single node.

You can click *Reset defaults* to remove the existing filters, and apply the filter defined in `FlowCollector` configuration.
