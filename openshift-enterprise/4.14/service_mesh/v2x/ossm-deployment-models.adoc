{SMProductName} supports several different deployment models that can be combined in different ways to best suit your business requirements.

In Istio, a tenant is a group of users that share common access and privileges for a set of deployed workloads. You can use tenants to provide a level of isolation between different teams. You can segregate access to different tenants using `NetworkPolicies`, `AuthorizationPolicies`, and `exportTo` annotations on istio.io or service resources.

[id="ossm-deploy-cluster-wide-mesh_{context}"]
= Cluster-Wide (Single Tenant) mesh deployment model

A cluster-wide deployment contains a Service Mesh Control Plane that monitors resources for an entire cluster. Monitoring resources for an entire cluster closely resembles Istio functionality in that the control plane uses a single query across all namespaces to monitor Istio and Kubernetes resources. As a result, cluster-wide deployments decrease the number of requests sent to the API server.

Similar to Istio, a cluster-wide mesh includes namespaces with the `istio-injection=enabled` namespace label by default. You can change this label by modifying the `spec.labelSelectors` field of the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="ossm-deploy-multitenant_{context}"]
= Multitenant deployment model

{SMProductName} installs a `ServiceMeshControlPlane` that is configured for multitenancy by default. {SMProductName} uses a multitenant Operator to manage the {SMProductShortName} control plane lifecycle. Within a mesh, namespaces are used for tenancy.

{SMProductName} uses `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resources to manage mesh installations, whose scope is limited by default to namespace that contains the resource. You use `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` and `ServiceMeshMember` resources to include additional namespaces into the mesh. A namespace can only be included in a single mesh, and multiple meshes can be installed in a single OpenShift cluster.

Typical service mesh deployments use a single {SMProductShortName} control plane to configure communication between services in the mesh. {SMProductName} supports “soft multitenancy”, where there is one control plane and one mesh per tenant, and there can be multiple independent control planes within the cluster. Multitenant deployments specify the projects that can access the {SMProductShortName} and isolate the {SMProductShortName} from other control plane instances.

The cluster administrator gets control and visibility across all the Istio control planes, while the tenant administrator only gets control over their specific {SMProductShortName}, Kiali, and Jaeger instances.

You can grant a team permission to deploy its workloads only to a given namespace or set of namespaces. If granted the `mesh-user` role by the service mesh administrator, users can create a `ServiceMeshMember` resource to add namespaces to the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`.

[id="ossm-deploy-multi-mesh_{context}"]
= Multimesh or federated deployment model

_Federation_ is a deployment model that lets you share services and workloads between separate meshes managed in distinct administrative domains.

The Istio multi-cluster model requires a high level of trust between meshes and remote access to all Kubernetes API servers on which the individual meshes reside. {SMProductName} federation takes an opinionated approach to a multi-cluster implementation of Service Mesh that assumes _minimal_ trust between meshes.

A _federated mesh_ is a group of meshes behaving as a single mesh. The services in each mesh can be unique services, for example a mesh adding services by importing them from another mesh, can provide additional workloads for the same services across the meshes, providing high availability, or a combination of both. All meshes that are joined into a federated mesh remain managed individually, and you must explicitly configure which services are exported to and imported from other meshes in the federation. Support functions such as certificate generation, metrics and trace collection remain local in their respective meshes.
