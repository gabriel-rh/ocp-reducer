= About adding projects to a service mesh

After installing the Operators and creating the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, add one or more projects to the service mesh.

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title}, a project is essentially a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, such as the range of user IDs that can be used in the project. Typically, the {product-title} web console uses the term project, and the CLI uses the term namespace, but the terms are essentially synonymous.
====

You can add projects to an existing service mesh using either the {product-title} web console or the CLI. There are three methods to add a project to a service mesh:

* Specifying the project name in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.

* Configuring label selectors in the `spec.labelSelectors` field of the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.

* Creating the `ServiceMeshMember` resource in the project.

If you use the first method, then you must create the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.

[id="ossm-member-roll-create_{context}"]
= Creating the {SMProductName} member roll

The `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` lists the projects that belong to the {SMProductShortName} control plane. Only projects listed in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` are affected by the control plane. A project does not belong to a service mesh until you add it to the member roll for a particular control plane deployment.

You must create a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource named `default` in the same project as the `ServiceMeshControlPlane`, for example `istio-system`.

[id="ossm-member-roll-create-console_{context}"]
== Creating the member roll from the web console

You can add one or more projects to the {SMProductShortName} member roll from the web console. In this example, `istio-system` is the name of the {SMProductShortName} control plane project.

.Prerequisites
* An installed, verified {SMProductName} Operator.
* List of existing projects to add to the service mesh.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. If you do not already have services for your mesh, or you are starting from scratch, create a project for your applications. It must be different from the project where you installed the {SMProductShortName} control plane.

.. Navigate to *Home* -> *Projects*.

.. Enter a name in the *Name* field.

.. Click *Create*.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the *Project* menu and choose the project where your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource is deployed from the list, for example `istio-system`.

. Click the {SMProductName} Operator.

. Click the *Istio Service Mesh Member Roll* tab.

. Click *Create ServiceMeshMemberRoll*

. Click *Members*, then enter the name of your project in the *Value* field. You can add any number of projects, but a project can only belong to *one* `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.

. Click *Create*.

[id="ossm-member-roll-create-cli_{context}"]
== Creating the member roll from the CLI

You can add a project to the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` from the command line.

.Prerequisites

* An installed, verified {SMProductName} Operator.
* List of projects to add to the service mesh.
* Access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --username=<NAMEOFUSER> https://<HOSTNAME>:6443

[id="ossm-about-adding-projects-using-smmr_{context}"]
= About adding projects using the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource

Using the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource is the simplest way to add a project to a service mesh. To add a project, specify the project name in the `spec.members` field of the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource. The `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource specifies which projects are controlled by the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.

image::ossm-adding-project-using-smmr.png[Adding project using `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource image]

[NOTE]
====
Adding projects using this method requires the user to have the `update servicemeshmemberrolls` and the `update pods` privileges in the project that is being added.
====

* If you already have an application, workload, or service to add to the service mesh, see the following:
** Adding or removing projects from the mesh using the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource with the web console
** Adding or removing projects from the mesh using the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource with the CLI

* Alternatively, to install a sample application called Bookinfo and add it to a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource, see the Bookinfo example application tutorial.

[id="ossm-about-adding-projects-using-smm_{context}"]
= About adding projects using the ServiceMeshMember resource

A `ServiceMeshMember` resource provides a way to add a project to a service mesh without modifying the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource. To add a project, create a `ServiceMeshMember` resource in the project that you want to add to the service mesh. When the {SMProductShortName} Operator processes the `ServiceMeshMember` object, the project appears in the `status.members` list of the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource. Then, the services that reside in the project are made available to the mesh.

image::ossm-adding-project-using-smm.png[Adding project using `ServiceMeshMember` resource image]

The mesh administrator must grant each mesh user permission to reference the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource in the `ServiceMeshMember` resource. With this permission in place, a mesh user can add a project to a mesh even when that user does not have direct access rights for the service mesh project or the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource. For more information, see Creating the {SMProductName} members.

= Adding a project to the mesh using the ServiceMeshMember resource with the web console

You can add one or more projects to the mesh using the `ServiceMeshMember` resource with the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the {SMProductName} Operator.
* You know the name of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource and the name of the project that the resource belongs to.
* You know the name of the project you want to add to the mesh.
* A service mesh administrator must explicitly grant access to the service mesh. Administrators can grant users permissions to access the mesh by assigning them the `mesh-user` `Role` using a `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding`. For more information, see _Creating the {SMProductName} members_.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the *Project* menu and choose the project that you want to add to the mesh from the drop-down list. For example, `istio-system`.

. Click the {SMProductName} Operator.

. Click the *Istio Service Mesh Member* tab.

. Click *Create ServiceMeshMember*

. Accept the default name for the `ServiceMeshMember`.

. Click to expand *ControlPlaneRef*.

. In the *Namespace* field, select the project that the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource belongs to. For example, `istio-system`.

. In the *Name* field, enter the name of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource that this namespace belongs to. For example, `basic`.

. Click *Create*.

. Confirm the `ServiceMeshMember` resource was created, and that the project was added to the mesh. Click the resource name; for example, `default`. View the *Conditions* section shown at the end of the screen. Confirm that the `Status` of the `Reconciled` and `Ready` conditions is `True`.

[id="ossm-about-adding-projects-using-label-selectors_{context}"]
= About adding projects using label selectors

For cluster-wide deployments, you can use label selectors to add projects to the mesh. Label selectors specified in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource enable the {SMProductShortName} Operator to add or remove namespaces to or from the mesh based on namespace labels. Unlike other standard {product-title} resources that you can use to specify a single label selector, you can use the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource to specify multiple label selectors.

image::ossm-adding-project-using-label-selector.png[Adding project using label selector image]

If the labels for a namespace match any of the selectors specified in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource, then the namespace is included in the mesh.

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title}, a project is essentially a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, such as the range of user IDs that can be used in the project. Typically, the {product-title} web console uses the term _project_, and the CLI uses the term _namespace_, but the terms are essentially synonymous.

= Adding a project to the mesh using label selectors with the web console

You can use labels selectors to add a project to the {SMProductShortName} with the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the {SMProductName} Operator.
* The deployment has an existing `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.
* You are logged in as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you are logged in as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the *Project* menu, and from the drop-down list, select the project where your `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource is deployed. For example, *istio-system*.

. Click the {SMProductName} Operator.

. Click the *Istio Service Mesh Member Roll* tab.

. Click *Create ServiceMeshMember Roll*.

. Accept the default name for the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`.

. In the *Labels* field, enter key-value pairs to define the labels that identify which namespaces to include in the service mesh. If a project namespace has either label specified by the selectors, then the project namespace is included in the service mesh. You do not need to include both labels.
+
For example, entering `mykey=myvalue` includes all namespaces with this label as part of the mesh. When the selector identifies a match, the project namespace is added to the service mesh.
+
Entering `myotherkey=myothervalue` includes all namespaces with this label as part of the mesh. When the selector identifies a match, the project namespace is added to the service mesh.

<1> Contains the label selectors used to identify which project namespaces are included in the service mesh. If a project namespace has either label specified by the selectors, then the project namespace is included in the service mesh. The project namespace does not need both labels to be included.
<2> Specifies all namespaces with the `mykey=myvalue` label. When the selector identifies a match, the project namespace is added to the service mesh.
<3> Specifies all namespaces with the `myotherkey=myothervalue` label. When the selector identifies a match, the project namespace is added to the service mesh.

[id="ossm-tutorial-bookinfo-overview_{context}"]
= Bookinfo example application

The Bookinfo example application allows you to test your {SMProductName} {SMProductVersion} installation on {product-title}.

The Bookinfo application displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. The application displays a page that describes the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and other information), and book reviews.

The Bookinfo application consists of these microservices:

* The `productpage` microservice calls the `details` and `reviews` microservices to populate the page.
* The `details` microservice contains book information.
* The `reviews` microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the `ratings` microservice.
* The `ratings` microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.

There are three versions of the reviews microservice:

* Version v1 does not call the `ratings` Service.
* Version v2 calls the `ratings` Service and displays each rating as one to five black stars.
* Version v3 calls the `ratings` Service and displays each rating as one to five red stars.

[id="ossm-tutorial-bookinfo-install_{context}"]
= Installing the Bookinfo application

This tutorial walks you through how to create a sample application by creating a project, deploying the Bookinfo application to that project, and viewing the running application in {SMProductShortName}.

.Prerequisites:

* {product-title} 4.1 or higher installed.
* {SMProductName} {SMProductVersion} installed.
* Access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

[NOTE]
====
The Bookinfo sample application cannot be installed on {ibmzProductName} and {ibmpowerProductName}.
====

[NOTE]
====
The commands in this section assume the {SMProductShortName} control plane project is `istio-system`.  If you installed the control plane in another namespace, edit each command before you run it.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with cluster-admin rights. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

. Click *Home* -> *Projects*.

. Click *Create Project*.

. Enter `bookinfo` as the *Project Name*, enter a *Display Name*, and enter a *Description*, then click *Create*.
+
** Alternatively, you can run this command from the CLI to create the `bookinfo` project.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project bookinfo
----
+
. Click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the *Project* menu and use the {SMProductShortName} control plane namespace. In this example, use `istio-system`.

. Click the *{SMProductName}* Operator.

. Click the *Istio Service Mesh Member Roll* tab.

.. If you have already created a Istio Service Mesh Member Roll, click the name, then click the YAML tab to open the YAML editor.

.. If you have not created a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`, click *Create ServiceMeshMemberRoll*.
+
. Click *Members*, then enter the name of your project in the *Value* field.
+
. Click *Create* to save the updated Service Mesh Member Roll.
+
.. Or, save the following example to a YAML file.
+
.Bookinfo ServiceMeshMemberRoll example servicemeshmemberroll-default.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
  name: default
