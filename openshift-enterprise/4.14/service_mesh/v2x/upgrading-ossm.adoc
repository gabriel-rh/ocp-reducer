[id="ossm-versioning_{context}"]
= Understanding versioning

Red Hat uses semantic versioning for product releases. Semantic Versioning is a 3-component number in the format of X.Y.Z, where:

* X stands for a Major version. Major releases usually denote some sort of breaking change: architectural changes, API changes, schema changes, and similar major updates.

* Y stands for a Minor version. Minor releases contain new features and functionality while maintaining backwards compatibility.

* Z stands for a Patch version (also known as a z-stream release). Patch releases are used to addresses Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and release bug fixes. New features and functionality are generally not released as part of a Patch release.

== How versioning affects Service Mesh upgrades

Depending on the version of the update you are making, the upgrade process is different.

* *Patch updates* - Patch upgrades are managed by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM); they happen automatically when you update your Operators.

* *Minor upgrades* - Minor upgrades require both updating to the most recent {SMProductName} Operator version and manually modifying the `spec.version` value in your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resources.

* *Major upgrades* - Major upgrades require both updating to the most recent {SMProductName} Operator version and manually modifying the `spec.version` value in your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resources. Because major upgrades can contain changes that are not backwards compatible, additional manual changes might be required.

[id="ossm-versions_{context}"]
= Understanding Service Mesh versions

In order to understand what version of {SMProductName} you have deployed on your system, you need to understand how each of the component versions is managed.

* *Operator* version - The most current Operator version is {SMProductVersion}. The Operator version number only indicates the version of the currently installed Operator. Because the {SMProductName} Operator supports multiple versions of the {SMProductShortName} control plane, the version of the Operator does not determine the version of your deployed `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resources.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrading to the latest Operator version automatically applies patch updates, but does not automatically upgrade your {SMProductShortName} control plane to the latest minor version.
====
+
* *ServiceMeshControlPlane* version - The `ServiceMeshControlPlane` version determines what version of {SMProductName} you are using. The value of the `spec.version` field in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource controls the architecture and configuration settings that are used to install and deploy {SMProductName}. When you create the {SMProductShortName} control plane you can set the version in one of two ways:

** To configure in the Form View, select the version from the *Control Plane Version* menu.

** To configure in the YAML View, set the value for `spec.version` in the YAML file.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) does not manage {SMProductShortName} control plane upgrades, so the version number for your Operator and `ServiceMeshControlPlane` (SMCP) may not match, unless you have manually upgraded your SMCP.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
// * service_mesh/v2x/upgrading-ossm.adoc

[id="ossm-upgrade-considerations_{context}"]
= Upgrade considerations

The `maistra.io/` label or annotation should not be used on a user-created custom resource, because it indicates that the resource was generated by and should be managed by the {SMProductName} Operator.

[WARNING]
====
During the upgrade, the Operator makes changes, including deleting or replacing files, to resources that include the following labels or annotations that indicate that the resource is managed by the Operator.
====

Before upgrading check for user-created custom resources that include the following labels or annotations:

* `maistra.io/` AND the `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by` label set to `maistra-istio-operator` ({SMProductName})

* `kiali.io/` (Kiali)

* `jaegertracing.io/` ({JaegerName})

* `logging.openshift.io/` (Red Hat Elasticsearch)

Before upgrading, check your user-created custom resources for labels or annotations that indicate they are Operator managed. Remove the label or annotation from custom resources that you do not want to be managed by the Operator.

When upgrading to version 2.0, the Operator only deletes resources with these labels in the same namespace as the SMCP.

When upgrading to version 2.1, the Operator deletes resources with these labels in all namespaces.

[id="ossm-upgrade-known-issues_{context}"]
= Known issues that may affect upgrade

Known issues that may affect your upgrade include:

* When upgrading an Operator, custom configurations for Jaeger or Kiali might be reverted. Before upgrading an Operator, note any custom configuration settings for the Jaeger or Kiali objects in the {SMProductShortName} production deployment so that you can recreate them.

* {SMProductName} does not support the use of `EnvoyFilter` configuration except where explicitly documented. This is due to tight coupling with the underlying Envoy APIs, meaning that backward compatibility cannot be maintained. If you are using Envoy Filters, and the configuration generated by Istio has changed due to the lastest version of Envoy introduced by upgrading your `ServiceMeshControlPlane`, that has the potential to break any `EnvoyFilter` you may have implemented.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-1505[OSSM-1505] `ServiceMeshExtension` does not work with {product-title} version 4.11. Because `ServiceMeshExtension` has been deprecated in {SMProductName} 2.2, this known issue will not be fixed and you must migrate your extensions to `WasmPluging`

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-1396[OSSM-1396] If a gateway resource contains the `spec.externalIPs` setting, rather than being recreated when the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` is updated, the gateway is removed and never recreated.

//Keep OSSM-1052 in RN - Closed as documented.
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-1052[OSSM-1052] When configuring a Service `ExternalIP` for the ingressgateway in the {SMProductShortName} control plane, the service is not created. The schema for the SMCP is missing the parameter for the service.
+
Workaround: Disable the gateway creation in the SMCP spec and manage the gateway deployment entirely manually (including Service, Role and RoleBinding).

[id="ossm-upgrading-operator_{context}"]
= Upgrading the Operators

In order to keep your {SMProductShortName} patched with the latest security fixes, bug fixes, and software updates, you must keep your Operators updated. You initiate patch updates by upgrading your Operators.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The version of the Operator does *not* determine the version of your service mesh. The version of your deployed {SMProductShortName} control plane determines your version of Service Mesh.
====

Because the {SMProductName} Operator supports multiple versions of the {SMProductShortName} control plane, updating the {SMProductName} Operator does _not_ update the `spec.version` value of your deployed `ServiceMeshControlPlane`. Also note that the `spec.version` value is a two digit number, for example 2.2, and that patch updates, for example 2.2.1, are not reflected in the SMCP version value.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) controls the installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators in a cluster. The OLM runs by default in {product-title}. OLM queries for available Operators as well as upgrades for installed Operators.

Whether or not you have to take action to upgrade your Operators depends on the settings you selected when installing them. When you installed each of your Operators, you selected an *Update Channel* and an *Approval Strategy*. The combination of these two settings determine when and how your Operators are updated.

.Interaction of Update Channel and Approval Strategy
[options="header"]
[cols="a, a, a"]
|====
| |Versioned channel|"Stable" or "Preview" Channel
|*Automatic*
|Automatically updates the Operator for minor and patch releases for that version only. Will not automatically update to the next major version (that is, from version 2.0 to 3.0). Manual change to Operator subscription required to update to the next major version.
|Automatically updates Operator for all major, minor, and patch releases.

|*Manual*
|Manual updates required for minor and patch releases for the specified version. Manual change to Operator subscription required to update to the next major version.
|Manual updates required for all major, minor, and patch releases.
|====

When you update your {SMProductName} Operator the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) removes the old Operator pod and starts a new pod. Once the new Operator pod starts, the reconciliation process checks the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` (SMCP), and if there are updated container images available for any of the {SMProductShortName} control plane components, it replaces those {SMProductShortName} control plane pods with ones that use the new container images.

When you upgrade the Kiali and {JaegerName} Operators, the OLM reconciliation process scans the cluster and upgrades the managed instances to the version of the new Operator. For example, if you update the {JaegerName} Operator from version 1.30.2 to version 1.34.1, the Operator scans for running instances of {JaegerShortName} and upgrades them to 1.34.1 as well.

To stay on a particular patch version of {SMProductName}, you would need to disable automatic updates and remain on that specific version of the Operator.

:leveloffset!:


[id="upgrading-control-plane"]
== Upgrading the control plane

You must manually update the control plane for minor and major releases. The community Istio project recommends canary upgrades, {SMProductName} only supports in-place upgrades. {SMProductName} requires that you upgrade from each minor release to the next minor release in sequence. For example, you must upgrade from version 2.0 to version 2.1, and then upgrade to version 2.2. You cannot update from {SMProductName} 2.0 to 2.2 directly.

When you upgrade the service mesh control plane, all Operator managed resources, for example gateways, are also upgraded.

Although you can deploy multiple versions of the control plane in the same cluster, {SMProductName} does not support canary upgrades of the service mesh. That is, you can have different SCMP resources with different values for `spec.version`, but they cannot be managing the same mesh.

For more information about migrating your extensions, refer to xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-extensions.adoc#ossm-extensions-migration-overview_ossm-extensions[Migrating from ServiceMeshExtension to WasmPlugin resources].

= Upgrade changes from version 2.3 to version 2.4

Upgrading the {SMProductShortName} control plane from version 2.3 to 2.4 introduces the following behavioral changes:

* Support for Istio OpenShift Routing (IOR) has been deprecated. IOR functionality is still enabled, but it will be removed in a future release.

* The following cipher suites are no longer supported, and were removed from the list of ciphers used in client and server side TLS negotiations.

** ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA
** ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA
** AES128-GCM-SHA256

** ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA
** ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
** AES256-GCM-SHA384
** AES256-SHA

= Migrating {SMProductName} from version 1.1 to version 2.0

Upgrading from version 1.1 to 2.0 requires manual steps that migrate your workloads and application to a new instance of {SMProductName} running the new version.

.Prerequisites

* You must upgrade to {product-title} 4.7. before you upgrade to {SMProductName} 2.0.
* You must have {SMProductName} version 2.0 operator. If you selected the *automatic* upgrade path, the operator automatically downloads the latest information. However, there are steps you must take to use the features in {SMProductName} version 2.0.

[id="ossm-migrating_{context}"]
== Upgrading {SMProductName}

To upgrade {SMProductName}, you must create an instance of {SMProductName} `ServiceMeshControlPlane` v2 resource in a new namespace. Then, once it's configured, move your microservice applications and workloads from your old mesh to the new service mesh.

.Procedure

. Check your v1 `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource configuration to make sure it is valid.
+
.. Run the following command to view your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource as a v2 resource.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get smcp -o yaml
----
+
.. Check the `spec.techPreview.errored.message` field in the output for information about any invalid fields.
+
.. If there are invalid fields in your v1 resource, the resource is not reconciled and cannot be edited as a v2 resource. All updates to v2 fields will be overridden by the original v1 settings. To fix the invalid fields, you can replace, patch, or edit the v1 version of the resource. You can also delete the resource without fixing it. After the resource has been fixed, it can be reconciled, and you can to modify or view the v2 version of the resource.
+
.. To fix the resource by editing a file, use `oc get` to retrieve the resource, edit the text file locally, and replace the resource with the file you edited.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get smcp.v1.maistra.io <smcp_name> > smcp-resource.yaml
#Edit the smcp-resource.yaml file.

== Configuring the 2.0 ServiceMeshControlPlane

The `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource has been changed for {SMProductName} version 2.0. After you created a v2 version of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, modify it to take advantage of the new features and to fit your deployment. Consider the following changes to the specification and behavior of {SMProductName} 2.0 as you're modifying your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. You can also refer to the {SMProductName} 2.0 product documentation for new information to features you use. The v2 resource must be used for {SMProductName} 2.0 installations.

[id="ossm-migrating-differences-arch_{context}"]
=== Architecture changes

The architectural units used by previous versions have been replaced by Istiod. In 2.0 the {SMProductShortName} control plane components Mixer, Pilot, Citadel, Galley, and the sidecar injector functionality have been combined into a single component, Istiod.

Although Mixer is no longer supported as a control plane component, Mixer policy and telemetry plugins are now supported through WASM extensions in Istiod. Mixer can be enabled for policy and telemetry if you need to integrate legacy Mixer plugins.

Secret Discovery Service (SDS) is used to distribute certificates and keys to sidecars directly from Istiod. In {SMProductName} version 1.1, secrets were generated by Citadel, which were used by the proxies to retrieve their client certificates and keys.

[id="ossm-migrating-differences-annotation_{context}"]
=== Annotation changes

The following annotations are no longer supported in v2.0. If you are using one of these annotations, you must update your workload before moving it to a v2.0 {SMProductShortName} control plane.

* `sidecar.maistra.io/proxyCPULimit` has been replaced with `sidecar.istio.io/proxyCPULimit`. If you were using `sidecar.maistra.io` annotations on your workloads, you must modify those workloads to use `sidecar.istio.io` equivalents instead.
* `sidecar.maistra.io/proxyMemoryLimit` has been replaced with `sidecar.istio.io/proxyMemoryLimit`
* `sidecar.istio.io/discoveryAddress` is no longer supported. Also, the default discovery address has moved from `pilot.<control_plane_namespace>.svc:15010` (or port 15011, if mtls is enabled) to `istiod-<smcp_name>.<control_plane_namespace>.svc:15012`.
* The health status port is no longer configurable and is hard-coded to 15021.  * If you were defining a custom status port, for example, `status.sidecar.istio.io/port`, you must remove the override before moving the workload to a v2.0 {SMProductShortName} control plane. Readiness checks can still be disabled by setting the status port to `0`.
* Kubernetes Secret resources are no longer used to distribute client certificates for sidecars. Certificates are now distributed through Istiod's SDS service. If you were relying on mounted secrets, they are longer available for workloads in v2.0 {SMProductShortName} control planes.

[id="ossm-migrating-differences-behavior_{context}"]
=== Behavioral changes

Some features in {SMProductName} 2.0 work differently than they did in previous versions.

* The readiness port on gateways has moved from `15020` to `15021`.
* The target host visibility includes VirtualService, as well as ServiceEntry resources. It includes any restrictions applied through Sidecar resources.
* Automatic mutual TLS is enabled by default. Proxy to proxy communication is automatically configured to use mTLS, regardless of global PeerAuthentication policies in place.
* Secure connections are always used when proxies communicate with the {SMProductShortName} control plane regardless of `spec.security.controlPlane.mtls` setting. The `spec.security.controlPlane.mtls` setting is only used when configuring connections for Mixer telemetry or policy.

[id="ossm-migrating-unsupported-resources_{context}"]
=== Migration details for unsupported resources

.Policy (authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1)

Policy resources must be migrated to new resource types for use with v2.0 {SMProductShortName} control planes, PeerAuthentication and RequestAuthentication. Depending on the specific configuration in your Policy resource, you may have to configure multiple resources to achieve the same effect.

.Mutual TLS

Mutual TLS enforcement is accomplished using the `security.istio.io/v1beta1` PeerAuthentication resource. The legacy `spec.peers.mtls.mode` field maps directly to the new resource's `spec.mtls.mode` field. Selection criteria has changed from specifying a service name in `spec.targets[x].name` to a label selector in `spec.selector.matchLabels`. In PeerAuthentication, the labels must match the selector on the services named in the targets list. Any port-specific settings will need to be mapped into `spec.portLevelMtls`.

.Authentication

Additional authentication methods specified in `spec.origins`, must be mapped into a `security.istio.io/v1beta1` RequestAuthentication resource.  `spec.selector.matchLabels` must be configured similarly to the same field on PeerAuthentication. Configuration specific to JWT principals from `spec.origins.jwt` items map to similar fields in `spec.rules` items.

* `spec.origins[x].jwt.triggerRules` specified in the Policy must be mapped into one or more `security.istio.io/v1beta1` AuthorizationPolicy resources. Any `spec.selector.labels` must be configured similarly to the same field on RequestAuthentication.
* `spec.origins[x].jwt.triggerRules.excludedPaths` must be mapped into an AuthorizationPolicy whose spec.action is set to ALLOW, with `spec.rules[x].to.operation.path` entries matching the excluded paths.
* `spec.origins[x].jwt.triggerRules.includedPaths` must be mapped into a separate AuthorizationPolicy whose `spec.action` is set to `ALLOW`, with `spec.rules[x].to.operation.path` entries matching the included paths, and `spec.rules.[x].from.source.requestPrincipals` entries that align with the `specified spec.origins[x].jwt.issuer` in the Policy resource.

.ServiceMeshPolicy (maistra.io/v1)

ServiceMeshPolicy was configured automatically for the {SMProductShortName} control plane through the `spec.istio.global.mtls.enabled` in the v1 resource or `spec.security.dataPlane.mtls` in the v2 resource setting. For v2 control planes, a functionally equivalent PeerAuthentication resource is created during installation. This feature is deprecated in {SMProductName} version 2.0

.RbacConfig, ServiceRole, ServiceRoleBinding (rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1)

These resources were replaced by the `security.istio.io/v1beta1` AuthorizationPolicy resource.

Mimicking RbacConfig behavior requires writing a default AuthorizationPolicy whose settings depend on the spec.mode specified in the RbacConfig.

* When `spec.mode` is set to `OFF`, no resource is required as the default policy is ALLOW, unless an AuthorizationPolicy applies to the request.
* When `spec.mode` is set to ON, set `spec: {}`.  You must create AuthorizationPolicy policies for all services in the mesh.
* `spec.mode` is set to `ON_WITH_INCLUSION`, must create an AuthorizationPolicy with `spec: {}` in each included namespace. Inclusion of individual services is not supported by AuthorizationPolicy. However, as soon as any AuthorizationPolicy is created that applies to the workloads for the service, all other requests not explicitly allowed will be denied.
* When `spec.mode` is set to `ON_WITH_EXCLUSION`, it is not supported by AuthorizationPolicy. A global DENY policy can be created, but an AuthorizationPolicy must be created for every workload in the mesh because there is no allow-all policy that can be applied to either a namespace or a workload.

AuthorizationPolicy includes configuration for both the selector to which the configuration applies, which is similar to the function ServiceRoleBinding provides and the rules which should be applied, which is similar to the function ServiceRole provides.

.ServiceMeshRbacConfig (maistra.io/v1)

This resource is replaced by using a `security.istio.io/v1beta1` AuthorizationPolicy resource with an empty spec.selector in the {SMProductShortName} control plane's namespace.  This policy will be the default authorization policy applied to all workloads in the mesh.  For specific migration details, see RbacConfig above.

[id="ossm-migrating-mixer_{context}"]
=== Mixer plugins

Mixer components are disabled by default in version 2.0. If you rely on Mixer plugins for your workload, you must configure your version 2.0 `ServiceMeshControlPlane` to include the Mixer components.

To enable the Mixer policy components, add the following snippet to your `ServiceMeshControlPlane`.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  policy:
    type: Mixer
----

To enable the Mixer telemetry components, add the following snippet to your `ServiceMeshControlPlane`.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  telemetry:
    type: Mixer
----

Legacy mixer plugins can also be migrated to WASM and integrated using the new ServiceMeshExtension (maistra.io/v1alpha1) custom resource.

Built-in WASM filters included in the upstream Istio distribution are not available in {SMProductName} 2.0.

[id="ossm-migrating-mtls_{context}"]
=== Mutual TLS changes

When using mTLS with workload specific PeerAuthentication policies, a corresponding DestinationRule is required to allow traffic if the workload policy differs from the namespace/global policy.

Auto mTLS is enabled by default, but can be disabled by setting `spec.security.dataPlane.automtls` to false in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. When disabling auto mTLS, DestinationRules may be required for proper communication between services. For example, setting PeerAuthentication to `STRICT` for one namespace may prevent services in other namespaces from accessing them, unless a DestinationRule configures TLS mode for the services in the namespace.

For information about mTLS, see xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-security.adoc#ossm-security-mtls_ossm-security[Enabling mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)]

[id="ossm-migrating-config-recipes_{context}"]
== Configuration recipes

You can configure the following items with these configuration recipes.

[id="ossm-migrating-config-mtls_{context}"]
=== Mutual TLS in a data plane

Mutual TLS for data plane communication is configured through `spec.security.dataPlane.mtls` in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, which is `false` by default.

[id="ossm-migrating-config-sign-key_{context}"]
=== Custom signing key

Istiod manages client certificates and private keys used by service proxies. By default, Istiod uses a self-signed certificate for signing, but you can configure a custom certificate and private key. For more information about how to configure signing keys, see xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-security.adoc#ossm-cert-manage_ossm-security[Adding an external certificate authority key and certificate]

[id="ossm-migrating-config-tracing_{context}"]
=== Tracing

Tracing is configured in `spec.tracing`. Currently, the only type of tracer that is supported is `Jaeger`. Sampling is a scaled integer representing 0.01% increments, for example, 1 is 0.01% and 10000 is 100%. The tracing implementation and sampling rate can be specified:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  tracing:
    sampling: 100 # 1%
    type: Jaeger
----

Jaeger is configured in the `addons` section of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  addons:
    jaeger:
      name: jaeger
      install:
        storage:
          type: Memory # or Elasticsearch for production mode
          memory:
            maxTraces: 100000
          elasticsearch: # the following values only apply if storage:type:=Elasticsearch

              cpu: "500m"
            limits:
              memory: "1Gi"
----

The Jaeger installation can be customized with the `install` field. Container configuration, such as resource limits is configured in `spec.runtime.components.jaeger` related fields. If a Jaeger resource matching the value of `spec.addons.jaeger.name` exists, the {SMProductShortName} control plane will be configured to use the existing installation. Use an existing Jaeger resource to fully customize your Jaeger installation.

[id="ossm-migrating-config-vis_{context}"]
=== Visualization

Kiali and Grafana are configured under the `addons` section of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  addons:
    grafana:
      enabled: true
      install: {} # customize install
    kiali:
      enabled: true
      name: kiali
      install: {} # customize install
----

The Grafana and Kiali installations can be customized through their respective `install` fields. Container customization, such as resource limits, is configured in `spec.runtime.components.kiali` and `spec.runtime.components.grafana`. If an existing Kiali resource matching the value of name exists, the {SMProductShortName} control plane configures the Kiali resource for use with the control plane. Some fields in the Kiali resource are overridden, such as the `accessible_namespaces` list, as well as the endpoints for Grafana, Prometheus, and tracing. Use an existing resource to fully customize your Kiali installation.
