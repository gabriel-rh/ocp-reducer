toc::[]

While the xref:../../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-about.adoc#nodes-scheduler-about[scheduler] is used to determine the most suitable node to host a new pod, the descheduler can be used to evict a running pod so that the pod can be rescheduled onto a more suitable node.

= About the descheduler

You can use the descheduler to evict pods based on specific strategies so that the pods can be rescheduled onto more appropriate nodes.

You can benefit from descheduling running pods in situations such as the following:

* Nodes are underutilized or overutilized.
* Pod and node affinity requirements, such as taints or labels, have changed and the original scheduling decisions are no longer appropriate for certain nodes.
* Node failure requires pods to be moved.
* New nodes are added to clusters.
* Pods have been restarted too many times.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The descheduler does not schedule replacement of evicted pods. The scheduler automatically performs this task for the evicted pods.
====

When the descheduler decides to evict pods from a node, it employs the following general mechanism:

* Pods in the `openshift-*` and `kube-system` namespaces are never evicted.
* Critical pods with `priorityClassName` set to `system-cluster-critical` or `system-node-critical` are never evicted.
* Static, mirrored, or stand-alone pods that are not part of a replication controller, replica set, deployment, or job are never evicted because these pods will not be recreated.
* Pods associated with daemon sets are never evicted.
* Pods with local storage are never evicted.
* Best effort pods are evicted before burstable and guaranteed pods.
* All types of pods with the `descheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/evict` annotation are eligible for eviction. This annotation is used to override checks that prevent eviction, and the user can select which pod is evicted. Users should know how and if the pod will be recreated.
* Pods subject to pod disruption budget (PDB) are not evicted if descheduling violates its pod disruption budget (PDB). The pods are evicted by using eviction subresource to handle PDB.

:_mod-docs-content-type: REFERENCE
[id="nodes-descheduler-profiles_{context}"]
= Descheduler profiles
The following descheduler profiles are available:

`AffinityAndTaints`:: This profile evicts pods that violate inter-pod anti-affinity, node affinity, and node taints.
+
It enables the following strategies:
+
* `RemovePodsViolatingInterPodAntiAffinity`: removes pods that are violating inter-pod anti-affinity.
* `RemovePodsViolatingNodeAffinity`: removes pods that are violating node affinity.
* `RemovePodsViolatingNodeTaints`: removes pods that are violating `NoSchedule` taints on nodes.
+
Pods with a node affinity type of `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` are removed.

`TopologyAndDuplicates`:: This profile evicts pods in an effort to evenly spread similar pods, or pods of the same topology domain, among nodes.
+
It enables the following strategies:
+
* `RemovePodsViolatingTopologySpreadConstraint`: finds unbalanced topology domains and tries to evict pods from larger ones when `DoNotSchedule` constraints are violated.
* `RemoveDuplicates`: ensures that there is only one pod associated with a replica set, replication controller, deployment, or job running on same node. If there are more, those duplicate pods are evicted for better pod distribution in a cluster.

`LifecycleAndUtilization`:: This profile evicts long-running pods and balances resource usage between nodes.
+
It enables the following strategies:
+
* `RemovePodsHavingTooManyRestarts`: removes pods whose containers have been restarted too many times.
+
Pods where the sum of restarts over all containers (including Init Containers) is more than 100.

* `LowNodeUtilization`: finds nodes that are underutilized and evicts pods, if possible, from overutilized nodes in the hope that recreation of evicted pods will be scheduled on these underutilized nodes.
+
A node is considered underutilized if its usage is below 20% for all thresholds (CPU, memory, and number of pods).
+
A node is considered overutilized if its usage is above 50% for any of the thresholds (CPU, memory, and number of pods).

* `PodLifeTime`: evicts pods that are too old.
+
By default, pods that are older than 24 hours are removed. You can customize the pod lifetime value.

`SoftTopologyAndDuplicates`:: This profile is the same as `TopologyAndDuplicates`, except that pods with soft topology constraints, such as `whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway`, are also considered for eviction.
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not enable both `SoftTopologyAndDuplicates` and `TopologyAndDuplicates`. Enabling both results in a conflict.
====

`EvictPodsWithLocalStorage`:: This profile allows pods with local storage to be eligible for eviction.

`EvictPodsWithPVC`:: This profile allows pods with persistent volume claims to be eligible for eviction. If you are using `Kubernetes NFS Subdir External Provisioner`, you must add an excluded namespace for the namespace where the provisioner is installed.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="nodes-descheduler-installing_{context}"]
= Installing the descheduler

The descheduler is not available by default. To enable the descheduler, you must install the Kube Descheduler Operator from OperatorHub and enable one or more descheduler profiles.

By default, the descheduler runs in predictive mode, which means that it only simulates pod evictions. You must change the mode to automatic for the descheduler to perform the pod evictions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have enabled hosted control planes in your cluster, set a custom priority threshold to lower the chance that pods in the hosted control plane namespaces are evicted. Set the priority threshold class name to `hypershift-control-plane`, because it has the lowest priority value (`100000000`) of the hosted control plane priority classes.
====

.Prerequisites

* Cluster administrator privileges.
* Access to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.
. Create the required namespace for the Kube Descheduler Operator.
.. Navigate to *Administration* -> *Namespaces* and click *Create Namespace*.
.. Enter `openshift-kube-descheduler-operator` in the *Name* field, enter `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true` in the *Labels* field to enable descheduler metrics, and click *Create*.
. Install the Kube Descheduler Operator.
.. Navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.
.. Type *Kube Descheduler Operator* into the filter box.
.. Select the *Kube Descheduler Operator* and click *Install*.
.. On the *Install Operator* page, select *A specific namespace on the cluster*. Select *openshift-kube-descheduler-operator* from the drop-down menu.
.. Adjust the values for the *Update Channel* and *Approval Strategy* to the desired values.
.. Click *Install*.
. Create a descheduler instance.
.. From the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page, click the *Kube Descheduler Operator*.
.. Select the *Kube Descheduler* tab and click *Create KubeDescheduler*.
.. Edit the settings as necessary.
... To evict pods instead of simulating the evictions, change the *Mode* field to *Automatic*.

... Expand the *Profiles* section to select one or more profiles to enable. The `AffinityAndTaints` profile is enabled by default. Click *Add Profile* to select additional profiles.
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not enable both `TopologyAndDuplicates` and `SoftTopologyAndDuplicates`. Enabling both results in a conflict.
====
... Optional: Expand the *Profile Customizations* section to set optional configurations for the descheduler.
**** Set a custom pod lifetime value for the `LifecycleAndUtilization` profile. Use the *podLifetime* field to set a numerical value and a valid unit (`s`, `m`, or `h`). The default pod lifetime is 24 hours (`24h`).

**** Set a custom priority threshold to consider pods for eviction only if their priority is lower than a specified priority level. Use the *thresholdPriority* field to set a numerical priority threshold or use the *thresholdPriorityClassName* field to specify a certain priority class name.
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not specify both *thresholdPriority* and *thresholdPriorityClassName* for the descheduler.
====

**** Set specific namespaces to exclude or include from descheduler operations. Expand the *namespaces* field and add namespaces to the *excluded* or *included* list. You can only either set a list of namespaces to exclude or a list of namespaces to include. Note that protected namespaces (`openshift-*`, `kube-system`, `hypershift`) are excluded by default.

**** Experimental: Set thresholds for underutilization and overutilization for the `LowNodeUtilization` strategy. Use the *devLowNodeUtilizationThresholds* field to set one of the following values:
+
--
***** `Low`: 10% underutilized and 30% overutilized
***** `Medium`: 20% underutilized and 50% overutilized (Default)
***** `High`: 40% underutilized and 70% overutilized
--
+
[NOTE]
====
This setting is experimental and should not be used in a production environment.
====

... Optional: Use the *Descheduling Interval Seconds* field to change the number of seconds between descheduler runs. The default is `3600` seconds.
.. Click *Create*.

You can also configure the profiles and settings for the descheduler later using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). If you did not adjust the profiles when creating the descheduler instance from the web console, the `AffinityAndTaints` profile is enabled by default.
