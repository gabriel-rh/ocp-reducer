Sysctl settings are exposed through Kubernetes, allowing users to modify certain kernel parameters at runtime. Only sysctls that are namespaced can be set independently on pods. If a sysctl is not namespaced, called _node-level_, you must use another method of setting the sysctl, such as by using the Node Tuning Operator.

Network sysctls are a special category of sysctl. Network sysctls include:

* System-wide sysctls, for example `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range`, that are valid for all networking. You can set these independently for each pod on a node.
* Interface-specific sysctls, for example `net.ipv4.conf.IFNAME.accept_local`, that only apply to a specific additional network interface for a given pod. You can set these independently for each additional network configuration. You set these by using a configuration in the `tuning-cni` after the network interfaces are created.

Moreover, only those sysctls considered _safe_ are whitelisted by default; you
can manually enable other _unsafe_ sysctls on the node to be available to the
user.

= About sysctls

In Linux, the sysctl interface allows an administrator to modify kernel parameters at runtime. Parameters are available from the `_/proc/sys/_` virtual process file system. The parameters cover various subsystems, such as:

- kernel (common prefix: `_kernel._`)
- networking (common prefix: `_net._`)
- virtual memory (common prefix: `_vm._`)
- MDADM (common prefix: `_dev._`)

More subsystems are described in link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/README[Kernel documentation].
To get a list of all parameters, run:

[id="namespaced-and-node-level-sysctls"]
= Namespaced and node-level sysctls

A number of sysctls are _namespaced_ in the Linux kernels. This means that you can set them independently for each pod on a node. Being namespaced is a requirement for sysctls to be accessible in a pod context within Kubernetes.

The following sysctls are known to be namespaced:

- `_kernel.shm*_`
- `_kernel.msg*_`
- `_kernel.sem_`
- `_fs.mqueue.*_`

Additionally, most of the sysctls in the `net.*` group are known to be namespaced. Their namespace adoption differs based on the kernel version and distributor.

Sysctls that are not namespaced are called _node-level_ and must be set
manually by the cluster administrator, either by means of the underlying Linux
distribution of the nodes, such as by modifying the `_/etc/sysctls.conf_` file,
or by using a daemon set with privileged containers. You can use the Node Tuning Operator to set _node-level_ sysctls.


[NOTE]
====
Consider marking nodes with special sysctls as tainted. Only schedule pods onto
them that need those sysctl settings. Use the taints and toleration feature to mark the nodes.

:_mod-docs-content-type: REFERENCE
[id="safe_and_unsafe_sysctls_{context}"]
= Safe and unsafe sysctls

Sysctls are grouped into _safe_ and _unsafe_ sysctls.

For system-wide sysctls to be considered safe, they must be namespaced. A namespaced sysctl ensures there is isolation between namespaces and therefore pods. If you set a sysctl for one pod it must not add any of the following:

- Influence any other pod on the node
- Harm the node health
- Gain CPU or memory resources outside of the resource limits of a pod

[NOTE]
====
Being namespaced alone is not sufficient for the sysctl to be considered safe.
====
Any sysctl that is not added to the allowed list on {product-title} is considered unsafe for {product-title}.

Unsafe sysctls are not allowed by default. For system-wide sysctls the cluster administrator must manually enable them on a per-node basis. Pods with disabled unsafe sysctls are scheduled but do not launch.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot manually enable interface-specific unsafe sysctls.
====

{product-title} adds the following system-wide and interface-specific safe sysctls to an allowed safe list:

.System-wide safe sysctls
[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| sysctl | Description

| `kernel.shm_rmid_forced`
a|When set to `1`, all shared memory objects in current IPC namespace are automatically forced to use IPC_RMID. For more information, see link:https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/sysctl/kernel.html?highlight=shm_rmid_forced#shm-rmid-forced[shm_rmid_forced].

| `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range`
a| Defines the local port range that is used by TCP and UDP to choose the local port. The first number is the first port number, and the second number is the last local port number. If possible, it is better if these numbers have different parity (one even and one odd value). They must be greater than or equal to `ip_unprivileged_port_start`. The default values are `32768` and `60999` respectively. For more information, see link:https://docs.kernel.org/networking/ip-sysctl.html?highlight=ip_local_port_range#ip-variables[ip_local_port_range].

| `net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies`
|When `net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies` is set, the kernel handles TCP SYN packets normally until the
half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. This functionality allows the system to keep accepting valid connections, even if under a denial-of-service attack. For more information, see link:https://docs.kernel.org/networking/ip-sysctl.html?highlight=tcp_syncookies#tcp-variables[tcp_syncookies].

| `net.ipv4.ping_group_range`
a| This restricts `ICMP_PROTO` datagram sockets to users in the group range. The default is `1 0`, meaning that nobody, not even root, can create ping sockets. For more information, see link:https://docs.kernel.org/networking/ip-sysctl.html?highlight=ping_group_range#ip-variables[ping_group_range].

| `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start`
| This defines the first unprivileged port in the network namespace. To disable all privileged ports, set this to `0`. Privileged ports must not overlap with the `ip_local_port_range`. For more information, see link:https://docs.kernel.org/networking/ip-sysctl.html?highlight=ip_unprivileged_port_start#ip-variables#ip-variables[ip_unprivileged_port_start].

.Interface-specific safe sysctls
[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| sysctl | Description

| `net.ipv4.conf.IFNAME.accept_redirects`
a| Accept IPv4 ICMP redirect messages.

| `net.ipv4.conf.IFNAME.accept_source_route`
|Accept IPv4 packets with strict source route (SRR) option.

| `net.ipv4.conf.IFNAME.arp_accept`
a| Define behavior for gratuitous ARP frames with an IPv4 address that is not already present in the ARP table:

* `0` - Do not create new entries in the ARP table.

* `1` - Create new entries in the ARP table.

| `net.ipv4.conf.IFNAME.arp_notify`
| Define mode for notification of IPv4 address and device changes.

| `net.ipv4.conf.IFNAME.disable_policy`
a| Disable IPSEC policy (SPD) for this IPv4 interface.

| `net.ipv4.conf.IFNAME.secure_redirects`
a| Accept ICMP redirect messages only to gateways listed in the interface’s current gateway list.

| `net.ipv4.conf.IFNAME.send_redirects`
| Send redirects is enabled only if the node acts as a router. That is, a host should not send an ICMP redirect message. It is used by routers to notify the host about a better routing path that is available for a particular destination.

| `net.ipv6.conf.IFNAME.accept_ra`
a| Accept IPv6 Router advertisements; autoconfigure using them. It also determines whether or not to transmit router solicitations. Router solicitations are transmitted only if the functional setting is to accept router advertisements.

| `net.ipv6.conf.IFNAME.accept_redirects`
a| Accept IPv6 ICMP redirect messages.

| `net.ipv6.conf.IFNAME.accept_source_route`
a| Accept IPv6 packets with SRR option.

| `net.ipv6.conf.IFNAME.arp_accept`
a| Define behavior for gratuitous ARP frames with an IPv6 address that is not already present in the ARP table:

* `0` - Do not create new entries in the ARP table.

* `1` - Create new entries in the ARP table.

| `net.ipv6.conf.IFNAME.arp_notify`
|  Define mode for notification of IPv6 address and device changes.

| `net.ipv6.neigh.IFNAME.base_reachable_time_ms`
| This parameter controls the hardware address to IP mapping lifetime in the neighbour table for IPv6.

| `net.ipv6.neigh.IFNAME.retrans_time_ms`
| Set the retransmit timer for neighbor discovery messages.

|===

[NOTE]
====
When setting these values using the `tuning` CNI plugin, use the value `IFNAME` literally. The interface name is represented by the `IFNAME` token, and is replaced with the actual name of the interface at runtime.

Safe sysctls are allowed by default.

* `kernel.shm_rmid_forced`
* `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range`
* `net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies`
* `net.ipv4.ping_group_range`

[WARNING]
====
To avoid destabilizing your operating system, modify sysctl parameters only after you understand their effects.
====

Use this procedure to start a pod with the configured sysctl settings.
[NOTE]
====
In most cases you modify an existing pod definition and add the `securityContext` spec.
====


.Procedure

. Create a YAML file `sysctl_pod.yaml` that defines an example pod and add the `securityContext` spec, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sysctl-example
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: podexample
    image: centos
    command: ["bin/bash", "-c", "sleep INF"]
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 2000 <1>
      runAsGroup: 3000 <2>
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false <3>
      capabilities: <4>
        drop: ["ALL"]
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true <5>
    seccompProfile: <6>
      type: RuntimeDefault
    sysctls:
    - name: kernel.shm_rmid_forced
      value: "1"
    - name: net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range
      value: "32770       60666"
    - name: net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies
      value: "0"
    - name: net.ipv4.ping_group_range
      value: "0           200000000"
----
<1> `runAsUser` controls which user ID the container is run with.
<2> `runAsGroup` controls which primary group ID the containers is run with.
<3> `allowPrivilegeEscalation` determines if a pod can request to allow privilege escalation. If unspecified, it defaults to true. This boolean directly controls whether the `no_new_privs` flag gets set on the container process.
<4> `capabilities` permit privileged actions without giving full root access. This policy ensures all capabilities are dropped from the pod.
<5> `runAsNonRoot: true` requires that the container will run with a user with any UID other than 0.
<6> `RuntimeDefault` enables the default seccomp profile for a pod or container workload.

. Create the pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f sysctl_pod.yaml
----
+
. Verify that the pod is created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

sysctl-example    1/1     Running           0          14s
----

. Log in to the pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh sysctl-example
----

. Verify the values of the configured sysctl flags. For example, find the value `kernel.shm_rmid_forced` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# sysctl kernel.shm_rmid_forced
----
+
.Expected output
[source,terminal]
----
kernel.shm_rmid_forced = 1
----

= Starting a pod with unsafe sysctls

A pod with unsafe sysctls fails to launch on any node unless the cluster administrator explicitly enables unsafe sysctls for that node. As with node-level sysctls, use the taints and toleration feature or labels on nodes to schedule those pods onto the right nodes.

The following example uses the pod `securityContext` to set a safe sysctl `kernel.shm_rmid_forced` and two unsafe sysctls, `net.core.somaxconn` and `kernel.msgmax`. There is no distinction between _safe_ and _unsafe_ sysctls in the specification.

[WARNING]
====
To avoid destabilizing your operating system, modify sysctl parameters only after you understand their effects.

The following example illustrates what happens when you add safe and unsafe sysctls to a pod specification:

[id="nodes-containers-sysctls-unsafe_{context}"]
= Enabling unsafe sysctls

A cluster administrator can allow certain unsafe sysctls for very special
situations such as high performance or real-time application tuning.

If you want to use unsafe sysctls, a cluster administrator must enable them
individually for a specific type of node. The sysctls must be namespaced.

You can further control which sysctls are set in pods by specifying lists of sysctls or sysctl patterns in the `allowedUnsafeSysctls` field of the Security Context Constraints.

- The `allowedUnsafeSysctls` option controls specific needs such as high performance or real-time application tuning.

[WARNING]
====
Due to their nature of being unsafe, the use of unsafe sysctls is
at-your-own-risk and can lead to severe problems, such as improper behavior of
containers, resource shortage, or breaking a node.
