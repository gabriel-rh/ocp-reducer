Device plugins allow you to use a particular device type (GPU, InfiniBand,
or other similar computing resources that require vendor-specific initialization
and setup) in your {product-title} pod without needing to write custom code.

// modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other
// assemblies.

= Understanding device plugins

The device plugin provides a consistent and portable solution to consume hardware
devices across clusters. The device plugin provides support for these devices
through an extension mechanism, which makes these devices available to
Containers, provides health checks of these devices, and securely shares them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} supports the device plugin API, but the device plugin
Containers are supported by individual vendors.
====

A device plugin is a gRPC service running on the nodes (external to
the `kubelet`) that is responsible for managing specific
hardware resources. Any device plugin must support following remote procedure
calls (RPCs):

[source,golang]
----
service DevicePlugin {
      // GetDevicePluginOptions returns options to be communicated with Device
      // Manager
      rpc GetDevicePluginOptions(Empty) returns (DevicePluginOptions) {}

      // ListAndWatch returns a stream of List of Devices
      // Whenever a Device state change or a Device disappears, ListAndWatch
      // returns the new list
      rpc ListAndWatch(Empty) returns (stream ListAndWatchResponse) {}

      // Allocate is called during container creation so that the Device
      // Plug-in can run device specific operations and instruct Kubelet
      // of the steps to make the Device available in the container
      rpc Allocate(AllocateRequest) returns (AllocateResponse) {}

      // PreStartcontainer is called, if indicated by Device Plug-in during
      // registration phase, before each container start. Device plug-in
      // can run device specific operations such as reseting the device
      // before making devices available to the container
      rpc PreStartcontainer(PreStartcontainerRequest) returns (PreStartcontainerResponse) {}
}
----

[NOTE]
====
For easy device plugin reference implementation, there is a stub device plugin
in the Device Manager code:
*_vendor/k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/kubelet/cm/deviceplugin/device_plugin_stub.go_*.
====

[id="methods-for-deploying-a-device-plugin_{context}"]
== Methods for deploying a device plugin

* Daemon sets are the recommended approach for device plugin deployments.
* Upon start, the device plugin will try to create a UNIX domain socket at
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugin/_* on the node to serve RPCs from Device Manager.
* Since device plugins must manage hardware resources, access to the host
file system, as well as socket creation, they must be run in a privileged
security context.
* More specific details regarding deployment steps can be found with each device
plugin implementation.

[id="nodes-pods-plugins-device-mgr_{context}"]
= Understanding the Device Manager

Device Manager provides a mechanism for advertising specialized node hardware resources
with the help of plugins known as device plugins.

You can advertise specialized hardware without requiring any upstream code changes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} supports the device plugin API, but the device plugin
Containers are supported by individual vendors.
====

Device Manager advertises devices as *Extended Resources*. User pods can consume
devices, advertised by Device Manager, using the same *Limit/Request* mechanism,
which is used for requesting any other *Extended Resource*.

Upon start, the device plugin registers itself with Device Manager invoking `Register` on the
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/kubelet.sock_* and starts a gRPC service at
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/<plugin>.sock_* for serving Device Manager
requests.

Device Manager, while processing a new registration request, invokes
`ListAndWatch` remote procedure call (RPC) at the device plugin service. In
response, Device Manager gets a list of *Device* objects from the plugin over a
gRPC stream. Device Manager will keep watching on the stream for new updates
from the plugin. On the plugin side, the plugin will also keep the stream
open and whenever there is a change in the state of any of the devices, a new
device list is sent to the Device Manager over the same streaming connection.

While handling a new pod admission request, Kubelet passes requested `Extended
Resources` to the Device Manager for device allocation. Device Manager checks in
its database to verify if a corresponding plugin exists or not. If the plugin exists
and there are free allocatable devices as well as per local cache, `Allocate`
RPC is invoked at that particular device plugin.

Additionally, device plugins can also perform several other device-specific
operations, such as driver installation, device initialization, and device
resets. These functionalities vary from implementation to implementation.

[id="nodes-pods-plugins-install_{context}"]
= Enabling Device Manager

Enable Device Manager to implement a device plugin to advertise specialized
hardware without any upstream code changes.

Device Manager provides a mechanism for advertising specialized node hardware resources
with the help of plugins known as device plugins.

. Obtain the label associated with the static `MachineConfigPool` CRD for the type of node you want to configure by entering the following command.
Perform one of the following steps:

.. View the machine config:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc describe machineconfig <name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc describe machineconfig 00-worker
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Name:         00-worker
Namespace:
Labels:       machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role=worker <1>
----
<1> Label required for the Device Manager.

.Procedure

. Create a custom resource (CR) for your configuration change.
+
.Sample configuration for a Device Manager CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: devicemgr <1>
spec:
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
       machineconfiguration.openshift.io: devicemgr <2>
  kubeletConfig:
    feature-gates:
      - DevicePlugins=true <3>
----
<1> Assign a name to CR.
<2> Enter the label from the Machine Config Pool.
<3> Set `DevicePlugins` to 'true`.

. Create the Device Manager:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f devicemgr.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
kubeletconfig.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/devicemgr created
----

. Ensure that Device Manager was actually enabled by confirming that
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/kubelet.sock_* is created on the node. This is
the UNIX domain socket on which the Device Manager gRPC server listens for new
plugin registrations. This sock file is created when the Kubelet is started
only if Device Manager is enabled.
