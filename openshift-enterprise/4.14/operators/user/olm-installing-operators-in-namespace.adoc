If a cluster administrator has delegated Operator installation permissions to your account, you can install and subscribe an Operator to your namespace in a self-service manner.

[id="olm-installing-operators-in-namespace-prereqs"]
== Prerequisites

* A cluster administrator must add certain permissions to your {product-title} user account to allow self-service Operator installation to a namespace. See xref:../../operators/admin/olm-creating-policy.adoc#olm-creating-policy[Allowing non-cluster administrators to install Operators] for details.

= About Operator installation with OperatorHub

OperatorHub is a user interface for discovering Operators; it works in conjunction with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which installs and manages Operators on a cluster.



As a user with the proper permissions, you can install an Operator from OperatorHub by using the {product-title} web console or CLI.

During installation, you must determine the following initial settings for the Operator:

Installation Mode:: Choose a specific namespace in which to install the Operator.

Update Channel:: If an Operator is available through multiple channels, you can choose which channel you want to subscribe to. For example, to deploy from the *stable* channel, if available, select it from the list.

Approval Strategy:: You can choose automatic or manual updates.
+
If you choose automatic updates for an installed Operator, when a new version of that Operator is available in the selected channel, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention.
+
If you select manual updates, when a newer version of an Operator is available, OLM creates an update request. As a
cluster administrator,
you must then manually approve that update request to have the Operator updated to the new version.

[id="olm-installing-from-operatorhub-using-web-console_{context}"]
= Installing from OperatorHub using the web console

You can install and subscribe to an Operator from OperatorHub by using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites


* Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with Operator installation permissions.

.Procedure

. Navigate in the web console to the *Operators → OperatorHub* page.

. Scroll or type a keyword into the *Filter by keyword* box to find the Operator you want. For example, type `{filter-type}` to find the {filter-operator} Operator.
+
You can also filter options by *Infrastructure Features*. For example, select *Disconnected* if you want to see Operators that work in disconnected environments, also known as restricted network environments.

. Select the Operator to display additional information.
+
[NOTE]
====
Choosing a Community Operator warns that Red Hat does not certify Community Operators; you must acknowledge the warning before continuing.
====

. Read the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:

.. Choose a specific, single namespace in which to install the Operator. The Operator will only watch and be made available for use in this single namespace.

.. If the cluster is in STS mode, add the role ARN in the *role ARN* field.

.. If more than one update channel is available, select an *Update channel*.

.. Select *Automatic* or *Manual* approval strategy, as described earlier.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the web console shows that the cluster is in "STS mode", you must set *Update approval* to *Manual*.

Subscriptions with automatic update approvals are not recommended because there might be permission changes to make prior to updating. Subscriptions with manual update approvals ensure that administrators have the opportunity to verify the permissions of the later version and take any necessary steps prior to update.
====

. Click *Install* to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces on this {product-title} cluster.

.. If you selected a *Manual* approval strategy, the upgrade status of the subscription remains *Upgrading* until you review and approve the install plan.
+
After approving on the *Install Plan* page, the subscription upgrade status moves to *Up to date*.

.. If you selected an *Automatic* approval strategy, the upgrade status should resolve to *Up to date* without intervention.

. After the upgrade status of the subscription is *Up to date*, select *Operators → Installed Operators* to verify that the cluster service version (CSV) of the installed Operator eventually shows up. The *Status* should ultimately resolve to *InstallSucceeded* in the relevant namespace.
+
[NOTE]
====
For the *All namespaces...* installation mode, the status resolves to *InstallSucceeded* in the `openshift-operators` namespace, but the status is *Copied* if you check in other namespaces.
====
+
If it does not:

.. Check the logs in any pods in the `openshift-operators` project (or other relevant namespace if *A specific namespace...* installation mode was selected) on the *Workloads → Pods* page that are reporting issues to troubleshoot further.
