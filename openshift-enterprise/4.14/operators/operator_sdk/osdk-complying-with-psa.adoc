_Pod security admission_ is an implementation of the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/[Kubernetes pod security standards]. link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/[Pod security admission] restricts the behavior of pods. Pods that do not comply with the pod security admission defined globally or at the namespace level are not admitted to the cluster and cannot run.

If your Operator project does not require escalated permissions to run, you can ensure your workloads run in namespaces set to the `restricted` pod security level. If your Operator project requires escalated permissions to run, you must set the following security context configurations:

* The allowed pod security admission level for the Operator's namespace
* The allowed security context constraints (SCC) for the workload's service account

// This xref points to a topic that is not currently included in the OSD/ROSA docs.

{product-title} includes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission[Kubernetes pod security admission]. Pods that do not comply with the pod security admission defined globally or at the namespace level are not admitted to the cluster and cannot run.

Globally, the `privileged` profile is enforced, and the `restricted` profile is used for warnings and audits.

You can also configure the pod security admission settings at the namespace level.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not run workloads in or share access to default projects. Default projects are reserved for running core cluster components.

The following default projects are considered highly privileged: `default`, `kube-public`, `kube-system`, `openshift`, `openshift-infra`, `openshift-node`, and other system-created projects that have the `openshift.io/run-level` label set to `0` or `1`. Functionality that relies on admission plugins, such as pod security admission, security context constraints, cluster resource quotas, and image reference resolution, does not work in highly privileged projects.
====

[id="psa-modes_{context}"]
== Pod security admission modes

You can configure the following pod security admission modes for a namespace:

.Pod security admission modes
[cols="1,2,3a",options="header"]
|===
|Mode
|Label
|Description

|`enforce`
|`pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce`
|Rejects a pod from admission if it does not comply with the set profile

|`audit`
|`pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit`
|Logs audit events if a pod does not comply with the set profile

|`warn`
|`pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn`
|Displays warnings if a pod does not comply with the set profile
|===

[id="psa-profiles_{context}"]
== Pod security admission profiles

You can set each of the pod security admission modes to one of the following profiles:

.Pod security admission profiles
[cols="1,3a",options="header"]
|===
|Profile
|Description

|`privileged`
|Least restrictive policy; allows for known privilege escalation

|`baseline`
|Minimally restrictive policy; prevents known privilege escalations

|`restricted`
|Most restrictive policy; follows current pod hardening best practices
|===

[id="psa-privileged-namespaces_{context}"]
== Privileged namespaces

The following system namespaces are always set to the `privileged` pod security admission profile:

* `default`
* `kube-public`
* `kube-system`

You cannot change the pod security profile for these privileged namespaces.

[id="security-context-constraints-psa-synchronization_{context}"]
= About pod security admission synchronization

In addition to the global pod security admission control configuration, a controller applies pod security admission control `warn` and `audit` labels to namespaces according to the SCC permissions of the service accounts that are in a given namespace.

The controller examines `ServiceAccount` object permissions to use security context constraints in each namespace. Security context constraints (SCCs) are mapped to pod security profiles based on their field values; the controller uses these translated profiles. Pod security admission `warn` and `audit` labels are set to the most privileged pod security profile in the namespace to prevent displaying warnings and logging audit events when pods are created.

Namespace labeling is based on consideration of namespace-local service account privileges.

Applying pods directly might use the SCC privileges of the user who runs the pod. However, user privileges are not considered during automatic labeling.

[id="security-context-constraints-psa-sync-exclusions_{context}"]
= Pod security admission synchronization namespace exclusions

Pod security admission synchronization is permanently disabled on most system-created namespaces. Synchronization is also initially disabled on user-created `openshift-*` prefixed namespaces, but you can enable synchronization on them later.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If a pod security admission label (`pod-security.kubernetes.io/<mode>`) is manually modified from the automatically labeled value on a label-synchronized namespace, synchronization is disabled for that label.

If necessary, you can enable synchronization again by using one of the following methods:

* By removing the modified pod security admission label from the namespace
* By setting the `security.openshift.io/scc.podSecurityLabelSync` label to `true`
+
If you force synchronization by adding this label, then any modified pod security admission labels will be overwritten.
====

[discrete]
== Permanently disabled namespaces

Namespaces that are defined as part of the cluster payload have pod security admission synchronization disabled permanently. The following namespaces are permanently disabled:

* `default`
* `kube-node-lease`
* `kube-system`
* `kube-public`
* `openshift`
* All system-created namespaces that are prefixed with `openshift-`, except for `openshift-operators`

[discrete]
== Initially disabled namespaces

By default, all namespaces that have an `openshift-` prefix have pod security admission synchronization disabled initially. You can enable synchronization for user-created [x-]`openshift-*` namespaces and for the `openshift-operators` namespace.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot enable synchronization for any system-created [x-]`openshift-*` namespaces, except for `openshift-operators`.
====

If an Operator is installed in a user-created `openshift-*` namespace, synchronization is enabled automatically after a cluster service version (CSV) is created in the namespace. The synchronized label is derived from the permissions of the service accounts in the namespace.

[id="osdk-ensuring-operator-workloads-run-restricted-psa_{context}"]
= Ensuring Operator workloads run in namespaces set to the restricted pod security level

To ensure your Operator project can run on a wide variety of deployments and environments, configure the Operator's workloads to run in namespaces set to the `restricted` pod security level.

[WARNING]
====
You must leave the `runAsUser` field empty. If your image requires a specific user, it cannot be run under restricted security context constraints (SCC) and restricted pod security enforcement.
====

.Procedure

* To configure Operator workloads to run in namespaces set to the `restricted` pod security level, edit your Operator's namespace definition similar to the following examples:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is recommended that you set the seccomp profile in your Operator's namespace definition. However, setting the seccomp profile is not supported in {product-title} 4.10.
====

** For Operator projects that must run in only {product-title} 4.11 and later, edit your Operator's namespace definition similar to the following example:
+
.Example `config/manager/manager.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
 securityContext:
   seccompProfile:
     type: RuntimeDefault <1>
   runAsNonRoot: true
 containers:
   - name: <operator_workload_container>
     securityContext:
       allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
       capabilities:
         drop:
           - ALL
...
----
<1> By setting the seccomp profile type to `RuntimeDefault`, the SCC defaults to the pod security profile of the namespace.

** For Operator projects that must also run in {product-title} 4.10, edit your Operator's namespace definition similar to the following example:
+
.Example `config/manager/manager.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
 securityContext: <1>
   runAsNonRoot: true
 containers:
   - name: <operator_workload_container>
     securityContext:
       allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
       capabilities:
         drop:
           - ALL
...
----
<1> Leaving the seccomp profile type unset ensures your Operator project can run in {product-title} 4.10.
