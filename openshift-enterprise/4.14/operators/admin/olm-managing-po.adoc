A platform Operator is an OLM-based Operator that can be installed during or after an OpenShift Container Platform cluster's Day 0 operations and participates in the cluster's lifecycle. As a cluster administrator, you can manage platform Operators by using the `PlatformOperator` API.

= About platform Operators

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) introduces a new type of Operator called _platform Operators_. A platform Operator is an OLM-based Operator that can be installed during or after an {product-title} cluster's Day 0 operations and participates in the cluster's lifecycle. As a cluster administrator, you can use platform Operators to further customize your {product-title} installation to meet your requirements and use cases.

Using the existing cluster capabilities feature in {product-title}, cluster administrators can already disable a subset of Cluster Version Operator-based (CVO) components considered non-essential to the initial payload prior to cluster installation. Platform Operators iterate on this model by providing additional customization options. Through the platform Operator mechanism, which relies on resources from the RukPak component, OLM-based Operators can now be installed at cluster installation time and can block cluster rollout if the Operator fails to install successfully.

In {product-title} 4.12, this Technology Preview release focuses on the basic platform Operator mechanism and builds a foundation for expanding the concept in upcoming releases. You can use the cluster-wide `PlatformOperator` API to configure Operators before or after cluster creation on clusters that have enabled the `TechPreviewNoUpgrades` feature set.

= Technology Preview restrictions for platform Operators

During the Technology Preview release of the platform Operators feature in {product-title} 4.12, the following restrictions determine whether an Operator can be installed through the platform Operators mechanism:

* Kubernetes manifests must be packaged using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) `registry+v1` bundle format.
* The Operator cannot declare package or group/version/kind (GVK) dependencies.
* The Operator cannot specify cluster service version (CSV) install modes other than `AllNamespaces`
* The Operator cannot specify any `Webhook` or `APIService` definitions.
* All package bundles must be in the `redhat-operators` catalog source.

After considering these restrictions, the following Operators can be successfully installed:

== Prerequisites

- Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.
- The `TechPreviewNoUpgrades` feature set enabled on the cluster.
+
[WARNING]
====
Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. These feature sets are not recommended on production clusters.
====
- Only the `redhat-operators` catalog source enabled on the cluster. This is a restriction during the Technology Preview release.
- The `oc` command installed on your workstation.

[id="olm-installing-po-during_{context}"]
= Installing platform Operators during cluster creation

As a cluster administrator, you can install platform Operators by providing `FeatureGate` and `PlatformOperator` manifests during cluster creation.

.Procedure

. Choose a platform Operator from the supported set of OLM-based Operators. For the list of this set and details on current limitations, see "Technology Preview restrictions for platform Operators".

. Select a cluster installation method and follow the instructions through creating an `install-config.yaml` file. For more details on preparing for a cluster installation, see "Selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users".

. After you have created the `install-config.yaml` file and completed any modifications to it, change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the name of the directory that contains the `install-config.yaml` file for your cluster.

. Create a `FeatureGate` object YAML file in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/` directory that enables the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set, for example a `feature-gate.yaml` file:
+
.Example `feature-gate.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  annotations:
    include.release.openshift.io/self-managed-high-availability: "true"
    include.release.openshift.io/single-node-developer: "true"
    release.openshift.io/create-only: "true"
  name: cluster
spec:
  featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade <1>
----
<1> Enable the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set.

. Create a `PlatformOperator` object YAML file for your chosen platform Operator in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/` directory, for example a `service-mesh-po.yaml` file for the {SMProductName} Operator:
+
.Example `service-mesh-po.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: platform.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: PlatformOperator
metadata:
  name: service-mesh-po
spec:
  package:
    name: servicemeshoperator
----

. When you are ready to complete the cluster install, refer to your chosen installation method and continue through running the `openshift-install create cluster` command.
+
During cluster creation, your provided manifests are used to enable the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set and install your chosen platform Operator.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Failure of the platform Operator to successfully install will block the cluster installation process.
====

.Verification

. Check the status of the `service-mesh-po` platform Operator by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get platformoperator service-mesh-po -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]

[id="olm-deleting-po_{context}"]
= Deleting platform Operators

As a cluster administrator, you can delete existing platform Operators. Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) performs a cascading deletion. First, OLM removes the bundle deployment for the platform Operator, which then deletes any objects referenced in the `registry+v1` type bundle.

[NOTE]
====
The platform Operator manager and bundle deployment provisioner only manage objects that are referenced in the bundle, but not objects subsequently deployed by any bundle workloads themselves. For example, if a bundle workload creates a namespace and the Operator is not configured to clean it up before the Operator is removed, it is outside of the scope of OLM to remove the namespace during platform Operator deletion.
====

.Procedure

. Get a list of installed platform Operators and find the name for the Operator you want to delete:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get platformoperator
----

. Delete the `PlatformOperator` resource for the chosen Operator, for example, for the Quay Operator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete platformoperator quay-operator
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
platformoperator.platform.openshift.io "quay-operator" deleted
----

.Verification

. Verify the namespace for the platform Operator is eventually deleted, for example, for the Quay Operator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ns quay-operator-system
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Error from server (NotFound): namespaces "quay-operator-system" not found
----

. Verify the `platform-operators-aggregated` cluster Operator continues to report an `Available=True` status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get co platform-operators-aggregated
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
