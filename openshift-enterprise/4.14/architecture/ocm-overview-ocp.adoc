{cluster-manager-first} is a managed service where you can install, modify, operate, and upgrade your Red Hat OpenShift clusters. This service allows you to work with all of your organizationâ€™s clusters from a single dashboard.

{cluster-manager} guides you to install {OCP}, Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), and {product-short-name} clusters. It is also responsible for managing both {OCP} clusters after self-installation as well as your ROSA and {product-short-name} clusters.

You can use {cluster-manager} to do the following actions:

* Create new clusters
* View cluster details and metrics
* Manage your clusters with tasks such as scaling, changing node labels, networking, authentication
* Manage access control
* Monitor clusters
* Schedule upgrades

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="accessing-ocm_{context}"]
= Accessing {cluster-manager-first}

You can access {cluster-manager} with your configured OpenShift account.

.Prerequisites

* You have an account that is part of an OpenShift organization.
* If you are creating a cluster, your organization has specified quota.

.Procedure

* Log in to {cluster-manager-url} using your login credentials.

[id="ocm-general-actions-ocp"]
== General actions

On the top right of the cluster page, there are some actions that a user can perform on the entire cluster:

* **Open console** launches a web console so that the cluster owner can issue commands to the cluster.
* **Actions** drop-down menu allows the cluster owner to rename the display name of the cluster, change the amount of load balancers and persistent storage on the cluster, if applicable, manually set the node count, and delete the cluster.
* **Refresh** icon forces a refresh of the cluster.

[id="ocm-cluster-tabs-ocp"]
== Cluster tabs

Selecting an active, installed cluster shows tabs associated with that cluster. The following tabs display after the cluster's installation completes:

* Overview
* Access control
* Add-ons
* Networking
* Insights Advisor
* Machine pools
* Support
* Settings

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="ocm-overview-tab_{context}"]
= Overview tab

The **Overview** tab provides information about how your cluster was configured:

* **Cluster ID** is the unique identification for the created cluster. This ID can be used when issuing commands to the cluster from the command line.
* **Type** shows the OpenShift version that the cluster is using.
* **Region** is the server region.
* **Provider** shows which cloud provider that the cluster was built upon.
* **Availability** shows which type of availability zone that the cluster uses, either single or multizone.
* **Version** is the OpenShift version that is installed on the cluster. If there is an update available, you can update from this field.
* **Created at** shows the date and time that the cluster was created.
* **Owner** identifies who created the cluster and has owner rights.
* **Subscription type** shows the subscription model that was selected on creation.
* **Infrastructure type** is the type of account that the cluster uses.
* **Status** displays the current status of the cluster.
* **Total vCPU** shows the total available virtual CPU for this cluster.
* **Total memory** shows the total available memory for this cluster.
* **Load balancers**
* **Persistent storage** displays the amount of storage that is available on this cluster.
* **Nodes** shows the actual and desired nodes on the cluster. These numbers might not match due to cluster scaling.
* **Network** field shows the address and prefixes for network connectivity.
* **Resource usage** section of the tab displays the resources in use with a graph.
* **Advisor recommendations** section gives insight in relation to security, performance, availability, and stablility. This section requires the use of remote health functionality. See _Using Insights to identify issues with your cluster_ in the _Additional resources_ section.
* **Cluster history** section shows everything that has been done with the cluster including creation and when a new version is identified.
