= Glossary of common terms for {product-title} architecture

This glossary defines common terms that are used in the architecture content.

access policies::
A set of roles that dictate how users, applications, and entities within a cluster interacts with one another. An access policy increases cluster security.

admission plugins::
Admission plugins enforce security policies, resource limitations, or configuration requirements.

authentication::
To control access to an {product-title} cluster, a cluster administrator can configure user authentication and ensure only approved users access the cluster. To interact with an {product-title} cluster, you must authenticate to the {product-title} API. You can authenticate by providing an OAuth access token or an X.509 client certificate in your requests to the {product-title} API.

bootstrap::
A temporary machine that runs minimal Kubernetes and deploys the {product-title} control plane.

certificate signing requests (CSRs)::
A resource requests a denoted signer to sign a certificate. This request might get approved or denied.

Cluster Version Operator (CVO)::
An Operator that checks with the {product-title} Update Service to see the valid updates and update paths based on current component versions and information in the graph.

compute nodes::
Nodes that are responsible for executing workloads for cluster users. Compute nodes are also known as worker nodes.

configuration drift::
A situation where the configuration on a node does not match what the machine config specifies.

containers::
Lightweight and executable images that consist software and all its dependencies. Because containers virtualize the operating system, you can run containers anywhere, from a data center to a public or private cloud to your local host.

container orchestration engine::
Software that automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers.

container workloads::
Applications that are packaged and deployed in containers.

control groups (cgroups)::
Partitions sets of processes into groups to manage and limit the resources processes consume.

control plane::
A container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the life cycle of containers. Control planes are also known as control plane machines.

CRI-O::
A Kubernetes native container runtime implementation that integrates with the operating system to deliver an efficient Kubernetes experience.

deployment::
A Kubernetes resource object that maintains the life cycle of an application.

Dockerfile::
A text file that contains the user commands to perform on a terminal to assemble the image.

hosted control planes::
A {product-title} feature that enables hosting a control plane on the {product-title} cluster from its data plane and workers. This model performs following actions:

* Optimize infrastructure costs required for the control planes.
* Improve the cluster creation time.
* Enable hosting the control plane using the Kubernetes native high level primitives. For example, deployments, stateful sets.
* Allow a strong network segmentation between the control plane and workloads.

hybrid cloud deployments::
Deployments that deliver a consistent platform across bare metal, virtual, private, and public cloud environments. This offers speed, agility, and portability.

Ignition::
A utility that {op-system} uses to manipulate disks during initial configuration. It completes common disk tasks, including partitioning disks, formatting partitions, writing files, and configuring users.

installer-provisioned infrastructure::
The installation program deploys and configures the infrastructure that the cluster runs on.

kubelet::
A primary node agent that runs on each node in the cluster to ensure that containers are running in a pod.

kubernetes manifest::

Machine Config Daemon (MCD)::
A daemon that regularly checks the nodes for configuration drift.

Machine Config Operator (MCO)::
An Operator that applies the new configuration to your cluster machines.

machine config pools (MCP)::
A group of machines, such as control plane components or user workloads, that are based on the resources that they handle.

metadata::
Additional information about cluster deployment artifacts.

pod::
One or more containers with shared resources, such as volume and IP addresses, running in your {product-title} cluster.
A pod is the smallest compute unit defined, deployed, and managed.

private registry::
{product-title} can use any server implementing the container image registry API as a source of the image which allows the developers to push and pull their private container images.

public registry::
{product-title} can use any server implementing the container image registry API as a source of the image which allows the developers to push and pull their public container images.

{op-system-base} {product-title} Cluster Manager::
A managed service where you can install, modify, operate, and upgrade your {product-title} clusters.

{op-system-base} Quay Container Registry::
A Quay.io container registry that serves most of the container images and Operators to {product-title} clusters.

replication controllers::
An asset that indicates how many pod replicas are required to run at a time.

A key security control to ensure that cluster users and workloads have only access to resources required to execute their roles.

route::
Routes expose a service to allow for network access to pods from users and applications outside the {product-title} instance.

scaling::
The increasing or decreasing of resource capacity.

service::
A service exposes a running application on a set of pods.

Source-to-Image (S2I) image::
An image created based on the programming language of the application source code in {product-title} to deploy applications.

[id="about-installation-and-updates"]
== About installation and updates

As a cluster administrator, you can use the {product-title} xref:../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[installation program] to install and deploy a cluster by using one of the following methods:

* Installer-provisioned infrastructure
* User-provisioned infrastructure

[id="about-control-planes"]
== About the control plane

The xref:../architecture/control-plane.adoc#control-plane[control plane] manages the worker nodes and the pods in your cluster. You can configure nodes with the use of machine config pools (MCPs).
MCPs are groups of machines, such as control plane components or user workloads, that are based on the resources that they handle.
{product-title} assigns different roles to hosts. These roles define the function of a machine in a cluster.
The cluster contains definitions for the standard control plane and worker role types.

You can use Operators to package, deploy, and manage services on the control plane.
Operators are important components in {product-title} because they provide the following services:

* Perform health checks
* Provide ways to watch applications
* Manage over-the-air updates
* Ensure applications stay in the specified state

[id="about-containerized-applications-for-developers"]
== About containerized applications for developers

As a developer, you can use different tools, methods, and formats to xref:../architecture/understanding-development.adoc#understanding-development[develop your containerized application] based on your unique requirements, for example:

* Use various build-tool, base-image, and registry options to build a simple container application.
* Use supporting components such as OperatorHub and templates to develop your application.
* Package and deploy your application as an Operator.

You can also create a Kubernetes manifest and store it in a Git repository.
Kubernetes works on basic units called pods. A pod is a single instance of a running process in your cluster. Pods can contain one or more containers.
You can create a service by grouping a set of pods and their access policies.
Services provide permanent internal IP addresses and host names for other applications to use as pods are created and destroyed. Kubernetes defines workloads based on the type of your application.

[id="coreos-and-ignition"]
== About {op-system-first} and Ignition

As a cluster administrator, you can perform the following {op-system-first} tasks:

** Learn about the next generation of xref:../architecture/architecture-rhcos.adoc#architecture-rhcos[single-purpose container operating system technology].
** Choose how to configure {op-system-first}
** Choose how to deploy {op-system-first}:
*** Installer-provisioned deployment
*** User-provisioned deployment

The {product-title} installation program creates the Ignition configuration files that you need to deploy your cluster.
{op-system-first} uses Ignition during the initial configuration to perform common disk tasks, such as partitioning, formatting, writing files, and configuring users.
During the first boot, Ignition reads its configuration from the installation media or the location that you specify and applies the configuration to the machines.

You can learn how xref:../architecture/architecture-rhcos.adoc#architecture-rhcos[Ignition works], the process for a {op-system-first} machine in an {product-title} cluster, view Ignition configuration files, and change Ignition configuration after an installation.

[id="about-admission-plug-ins"]
== About admission plugins
You can use xref:../architecture/admission-plug-ins.adoc#admission-plug-ins[admission plugins] to regulate how {product-title} functions. After a resource request is authenticated and authorized, admission plugins intercept the resource request to the master API to validate resource requests and to ensure that scaling policies are adhered to.
Admission plugins are used to enforce security policies, resource limitations, or configuration requirements.
