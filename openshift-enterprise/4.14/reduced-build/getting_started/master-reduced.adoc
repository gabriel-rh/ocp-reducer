toc::[]

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration tool developed by Google. You can run and manage container-based workloads by using Kubernetes. The most common Kubernetes use case is to deploy an array of interconnected microservices, building an application in a cloud native way. You can create Kubernetes clusters that can span hosts across on-premise, public, private, or hybrid clouds.

Traditionally, applications were deployed on top of a single operating system. With virtualization, you can split the physical host into several virtual hosts. Working on virtual instances on shared resources is not optimal for efficiency and scalability. Because a virtual machine (VM) consumes as many resources as a physical machine, providing resources to a VM such as CPU, RAM, and storage can be expensive. Also, you might see your application degrading in performance due to virtual instance usage on shared resources.

.Evolution of container technologies for classical deployments
image::247-OpenShift-Kubernetes-Overview.png[]

To solve this problem, you can use containerization technologies that segregate applications in a containerized environment. Similar to a VM, a container has its own filesystem, vCPU, memory, process space, dependencies, and more. Containers are decoupled from the underlying infrastructure, and are portable across clouds and OS distributions. Containers are inherently much lighter than a fully-featured OS, and are lightweight isolated processes that run on the operating system kernel. VMs are slower to boot, and are an abstraction of physical hardware. VMs run on a single machine with the help of a hypervisor.

You can perform the following actions by using Kubernetes:

* Sharing resources
* Orchestrating containers across multiple hosts
* Installing new hardware configurations
* Running health checks and self-healing applications
* Scaling containerized applications

.Kubernetes components
[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|Component |Purpose

|`kube-proxy`
|Runs on every node in the cluster and maintains the network traffic between the Kubernetes resources.

|`kube-controller-manager`
|Governs the state of the cluster.

|`kube-scheduler`
|Allocates pods to nodes.

|`etcd`
|Stores cluster data.

|`kube-apiserver`
|Validates and configures data for the API objects.

|`kubelet`
|Runs on nodes and reads the container manifests. Ensures that the defined containers have started and are running.

|`kubectl`
|Allows you to define how you want to run workloads. Use the `kubectl` command to interact with the `kube-apiserver`.

|Node
|Node is a physical machine or a VM in a Kubernetes cluster. The control plane manages every node and schedules pods across the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.

|container runtime
|container runtime runs containers on a host operating system. You must install a container runtime on each node so that pods can run on the node.

|Persistent storage
|Stores the data even after the device is shut down. Kubernetes uses persistent volumes to store the application data.

|`container-registry`
|Stores and accesses the container images.

|Pod
|The pod is the smallest logical unit in Kubernetes. A pod contains one or more containers to run in a worker node.

[id="kubernetes-resources_{context}"]
= Kubernetes resources

A custom resource is an extension of the Kubernetes API. You can customize Kubernetes clusters by using custom resources. Operators are software extensions which manage applications and their components with the help of custom resources. Kubernetes uses a declarative model when you want a fixed desired result while dealing with cluster resources. By using Operators, Kubernetes defines its states in a declarative way. You can modify the Kubernetes cluster resources by using imperative commands.
An Operator acts as a control loop which continuously compares the desired state of resources with the actual state of resources and puts actions in place to bring reality in line with the desired state.

Kubernetes is a core component of an {product-title}. You can use {product-title} for developing and running containerized applications. With its foundation in Kubernetes, the {product-title} incorporates the same technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other applications. You can extend your containerized applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments by using the {product-title}.

.Architecture of Kubernetes
image::247_OpenShift_Kubernetes_Overview-2.png[]

A cluster is a single computational unit consisting of multiple nodes in a cloud environment. A Kubernetes cluster includes a control plane and worker nodes. You can run Kubernetes containers across various machines and environments. The control plane node controls and maintains the state of a cluster. You can run the Kubernetes application by using worker nodes. You can use the Kubernetes namespace to differentiate cluster resources in a cluster. Namespace scoping is applicable for resource objects, such as deployment, service, and pods. You cannot use namespace for cluster-wide resource objects such as storage class, nodes, and persistent volumes.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="kubernetes-conceptual-guidelines_{context}"]
= Kubernetes conceptual guidelines

Before getting started with the {product-title}, consider these conceptual guidelines of Kubernetes:

* Start with one or more worker nodes to run the container workloads.
* Manage the deployment of those workloads from one or more control plane nodes.
* Wrap containers in a deployment unit called a pod. By using pods provides extra metadata with the container and offers the ability to group several containers in a single deployment entity.
* Create special kinds of assets. For example, services are represented by a set of pods and a policy that defines how they are accessed. This policy allows containers to connect to the services that they need even if they do not have the specific IP addresses for the services. Replication controllers are another special asset that indicates how many pod replicas are required to run at a time. You can use this capability to automatically scale your application to adapt to its current demand.

The API to {product-title} cluster is 100% Kubernetes. Nothing changes between a container running on any other Kubernetes and running on {product-title}. No changes to the application.
{product-title} brings added-value features to provide enterprise-ready enhancements to Kubernetes. {product-title} CLI tool  (`oc`) is compatible with `kubectl`. While the Kubernetes API is 100% accessible within {product-title}, the `kubectl` command-line lacks many features that could make it more user-friendly. {product-title} offers a set of features and command-line tool like `oc`.
Although Kubernetes excels at managing your applications, it does not specify or manage platform-level requirements or deployment processes. Powerful and flexible platform management tools and processes are important benefits that {product-title} offers. You must add authentication, networking, security, monitoring, and logs management to your containerization platform.

* Provide developers and IT organizations with cloud application platforms that can be used for deploying applications on secure and scalable resources.
* Require minimal configuration and management overhead.
* Bring the Kubernetes platform to customer data centers and cloud.
* Meet security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, {product-title} incorporates the same technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

= Glossary of common terms for {product-title}

This glossary defines common Kubernetes and {product-title} terms.

Kubernetes::
Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Containers::
Containers are application instances and components that run in OCI-compliant containers on the worker nodes. A container is the runtime of an Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant image. An image is a binary application. A worker node can run many containers. A node capacity is related to memory and CPU capabilities of the underlying resources whether they are cloud, hardware, or virtualized.

Pod::
A pod is one or more containers deployed together on one host. It consists of a colocated group of containers with shared resources such as volumes and IP addresses. A pod is also the smallest compute unit defined, deployed, and managed.
+
In {product-title}, pods replace individual application containers as the smallest deployable unit.
+
Pods are the orchestrated unit in {product-title}. {product-title} schedules and runs all containers in a pod on the same node. Complex applications are made up of many pods, each with their own containers. They interact externally and also with another inside the {product-title} environment.

Replica set and replication controller::
The Kubernetes replica set and the {product-title} replication controller are both available. The job of this component is to ensure the specified number of pod replicas are running at all times. If pods exit or are deleted, the replica set or replication controller starts more. If more pods are running than needed, the replica set deletes as many as necessary to match the specified number of replicas.

Deployment and DeploymentConfig::
{product-title} implements both Kubernetes `Deployment` objects and {product-title} `DeploymentConfigs` objects. Users may select either.
+
`Deployment` objects control how an application is rolled out as pods. They identify the name of the container image to be taken from the registry and deployed as a pod on a node. They set the number of replicas of the pod to deploy, creating a replica set to manage the process. The labels indicated instruct the scheduler onto which nodes to deploy the pod. The set of labels is included in the pod definition that the replica set instantiates.
+
`Deployment` objects are able to update the pods deployed onto the worker nodes based on the version of the `Deployment` objects and the various rollout strategies for managing acceptable application availability. {product-title} `DeploymentConfig` objects add the additional features of change triggers, which are able to automatically create new versions of the `Deployment` objects as new versions of the container image are available, or other changes.

Service::
A service defines a logical set of pods and access policies. It provides permanent internal IP addresses and hostnames for other applications to use as pods are created and destroyed.
+
Service layers connect application components together. For example, a front-end web service connects to a database instance by communicating with its service. Services allow for simple internal load balancing across application components. {product-title} automatically injects service information into running containers for ease of discovery.

Route::
A route is a way to expose a service by giving it an externally reachable hostname, such as www.example.com. Each route consists of a route name, a service selector, and optionally a security configuration. A router can consume a defined route and the endpoints identified by its service to provide a name that lets external clients reach your applications.  While it is easy to deploy a complete multi-tier application, traffic from anywhere outside the {product-title} environment cannot reach the application without the routing layer.

Build::
A build is the process of transforming input parameters into a resulting object. Most often, the process is used to transform input parameters or source code into a runnable image. A `BuildConfig` object is the definition of the entire build process. {product-title} leverages Kubernetes by creating containers from build images and pushing them to the integrated registry.

Project::
{product-title} uses projects to allow groups of users or developers to work together, serving as the unit of isolation and collaboration. It defines the scope of resources, allows project administrators and collaborators to manage resources, and restricts and tracks the user’s resources with quotas and limits.
+
A project is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations. It is the central vehicle for managing access to resources for regular users. A project lets a community of users organize and manage their content in isolation from other communities. Users must receive access to projects from administrators. But cluster administrators can allow developers to create their own projects, in which case users automatically have access to their own projects.
+
Each project has its own set of objects, policies, constraints, and service accounts.
+
Projects are also known as namespaces.

Operators::
An Operator is a Kubernetes-native application. The goal of an Operator is to put operational knowledge into software. Previously this knowledge only resided in the minds of administrators, various combinations or shell scripts or automation software such as Ansible. It was outside your Kubernetes cluster and hard to integrate. With Operators, all of this changes.
+
Operators are purpose-built for your applications. They implement and automate common Day 1 activities such as installation and configuration as well as Day 2 activities such as scaling up and down, reconfiguration, updates, backups, fail overs, and restores in a piece of software running inside your Kubernetes cluster by integrating natively with Kubernetes concepts and APIs. This is called a Kubernetes-native application.
+
With Operators, applications must not be treated as a collection of primitives, such as pods, deployments, services, or config maps. Instead, Operators should be treated as a single object that exposes the options that make sense for the application.

= Understanding {product-title}

{product-title} is a Kubernetes environment for managing the lifecycle of container-based applications and their dependencies on various computing platforms, such as bare metal, virtualized, on-premise, and in cloud. {product-title} deploys, configures and manages containers. {product-title} offers usability, stability, and customization of its components.

{product-title} utilises a number of computing resources, known as nodes. A node has a lightweight, secure operating system based on {op-system-base-full}, known as {op-system-first}.

After a node is booted and configured, it obtains a container runtime, such as CRI-O or Docker, for managing and running the images of container workloads scheduled to it. The Kubernetes agent, or kubelet schedules container workloads on the node. The kubelet is responsible for registering the node with the cluster and receiving the details of container workloads.

{product-title} configures and manages the networking, load balancing and routing of the cluster. {product-title} adds cluster services for monitoring the cluster health and performance, logging, and for managing upgrades.

The container image registry and OperatorHub provide Red Hat certified products and community built softwares for providing various application services within the cluster. These applications and services manage the applications deployed in the cluster, databases, frontends and user interfaces, application runtimes and business automation, and developer services for development and testing of container applications.

You can manage applications within the cluster either manually by configuring deployments of containers running from pre-built images or through resources known as Operators. You can build custom images from pre-build images and source code, and store these custom images locally in an internal, private or public registry.

The Multicluster Management layer can manage multiple clusters including their deployment, configuration, compliance and distribution of workloads in a single console.

= Scaling the application

In Kubernetes, a `Deployment` object defines how an application deploys. In most cases, users use `Pod`, `Service`, `ReplicaSets`, and `Deployment` resources together. In most cases, {product-title} creates the resources for you.

When you deploy the `national-parks-app` image, a deployment resource is created.  In this example, only one `Pod` is deployed.

The following procedure scales the `national-parks-image` to use two instances.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console.
* You are in the *Developer* perspective.
* You have a deployed image.

.Procedure

. In the *Topology* view, click the `national-parks-app` application.
. Click the *Details* tab.
. Use the up arrow to scale the pod to two instances.

[id="getting-started-cli-creating-new-project_{context}"]
= Creating a new project

A project enables a community of users to organize and manage their content in isolation. Projects are {product-title} extensions to Kubernetes namespaces. Projects have additional features that enable user self-provisioning.

Users must receive access to projects from administrators. Cluster administrators can allow developers to create their own projects. In most cases, users automatically have access to their own projects.

Each project has its own set of objects, policies, constraints, and service accounts.

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to an {product-title} cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

* To create a new project, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project user-getting-started --display-name="Getting Started with OpenShift"
----
+
.Example output

= Granting view permissions

{product-title} automatically creates a few special service accounts in every project. The default service account takes responsibility for running the pods. {product-title} uses and injects this service account into every pod that launches.

The following procedure creates a `RoleBinding` object for the default `ServiceAccount` object. The service account communicates with the {product-title} API to learn about pods, services, and resources within the project.

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to an {product-title} cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have a deployed image.
* You must have `cluster-admin` or `project-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

* To add the view role to the default service account in the `user-getting-started project`, enter the following command:

The simplest way to deploy an application in {product-title} is to run an existing container image. The following procedure deploys a front-end component of an application called `national-parks-app`. The web application displays an interactive map. The map displays the location of major national parks across the world.

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to an {product-title} cluster.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

* To deploy an application, enter the following command:

= Scaling the application

In Kubernetes, a `Deployment` object defines how an application deploys. In most cases, users use `Pod`, `Service`, `ReplicaSets`, and `Deployment` resources together. In most cases, {product-title} creates the resources for you.

When you deploy the `national-parks-app` image, a deployment resource is created.  In this example, only one `Pod` is deployed.

The following procedure scales the `national-parks-image` to use two instances.

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to an {product-title} cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have a deployed image.

.Procedure

* To scale your application from one pod instance to two pod instances, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --current-replicas=1 --replicas=2 deployment/parksmap
----
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----

.Verification
. To ensure that your application scaled properly, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
----
+
.Example output

    Python 3.9
    ----------
    Python 3.9 available as container is a base platform for building and running various Python 3.9 applications and frameworks. Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

= Connecting to a database

Deploy and connect a MongoDB database where the `national-parks-app` application stores location information.
Once you mark the `national-parks-app` application as a backend for the map visualization tool, `parksmap` deployment uses the {product-title} discover mechanism to display the map automatically.

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to an {product-title} cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have a deployed image.

.Procedure

* To connect to a database, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]

[id="getting-started-cli-creating-secret_{context}"]

= Creating a secret

The `Secret` object provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such as passwords, {product-title} client configuration files, private source repository credentials, and so on.
Secrets decouple sensitive content from the pods. You can mount secrets into containers using a volume plugin or the system can use secrets to perform actions on behalf of a pod.
The following procedure adds the secret `nationalparks-mongodb-parameters` and mounts it to the `nationalparks` workload.

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to an {product-title} cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have a deployed image.

.Procedure

. To create a secret, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic nationalparks-mongodb-parameters --from-literal=DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME=mongodb-nationalparks --from-literal=MONGODB_USER=mongodb --from-literal=MONGODB_PASSWORD=mongodb --from-literal=MONGODB_DATABASE=mongodb --from-literal=MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=mongodb
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
secret/nationalparks-mongodb-parameters created
----

. To update the environment variable to attach the mongodb secret to the `nationalpartks` workload, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
-----
$ oc set env --from=secret/nationalparks-mongodb-parameters deploy/nationalparks
-----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
deployment.apps/nationalparks updated
----

. To show the status of the `nationalparks` deployment, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rollout status deployment nationalparks
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
deployment "nationalparks" successfully rolled out
----

. To show the status of the `mongodb-nationalparks` deployment, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rollout status deployment mongodb-nationalparks
----
