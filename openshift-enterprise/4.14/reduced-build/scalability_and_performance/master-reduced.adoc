This topic provides recommended performance and scalability practices for control planes in {product-title}.

[id="recommended-scale-practices_{context}"]
= Recommended practices for scaling the cluster

The guidance in this section is only relevant for installations with cloud provider integration.

Apply the following best practices to scale the number of worker machines in your {product-title} cluster. You scale the worker machines by increasing or decreasing the number of replicas that are defined in the worker machine set.

When scaling up the cluster to higher node counts:

* Spread nodes across all of the available zones for higher availability.
* Scale up by no more than 25 to 50 machines at once.
* Consider creating new compute machine sets in each available zone with alternative instance types of similar size to help mitigate any periodic provider capacity constraints. For example, on AWS, use m5.large and m5d.large.

[NOTE]
====
Cloud providers might implement a quota for API services. Therefore, gradually scale the cluster.
====

The controller might not be able to create the machines if the replicas in the compute machine sets are set to higher numbers all at one time. The number of requests the cloud platform, which {product-title} is deployed on top of, is able to handle impacts the process. The controller will start to query more while trying to create, check, and update the machines with the status. The cloud platform on which {product-title} is deployed has API request limits;  excessive queries might lead to machine creation failures due to cloud platform limitations.

Enable machine health checks when scaling to large node counts. In case of failures, the health checks monitor the condition and automatically repair unhealthy machines.

[NOTE]
====
When scaling large and dense clusters to lower node counts, it might take large amounts of time because the process involves draining or evicting the objects running on the nodes being terminated in parallel. Also, the client might start to throttle the requests if there are too many objects to evict. The default client queries per second (QPS) and burst rates are currently set to `50` and `100` respectively. These values cannot be modified in {product-title}.

=  Control plane node sizing

The control plane node resource requirements depend on the number and type of nodes and objects in the cluster. The following control plane node size recommendations are based on the results of a control plane density focused testing, or _Cluster-density_. This test creates the following objects across a given number of namespaces:

- 1 image stream
- 1 build
- 5 deployments, with 2 pod replicas in a `sleep` state, mounting 4 secrets, 4 config maps, and 1 downward API volume each
- 5 services, each one pointing to the TCP/8080 and TCP/8443 ports of one of the previous deployments
- 1 route pointing to the first of the previous services
- 10 secrets containing 2048 random string characters
- 10 config maps containing 2048 random string characters


[options="header",cols="4*"]
|===
| Number of worker nodes |Cluster-density (namespaces) | CPU cores |Memory (GB)

| 24

| 501, but untested with the OVN-Kubernetes network plug-in
| 4000
| 16
| 96

|===

The data from the table above is based on an {product-title} running on top of AWS, using r5.4xlarge instances as control-plane nodes and m5.2xlarge instances as worker nodes.

On a large and dense cluster with three control plane nodes, the CPU and memory usage will spike up when one of the nodes is stopped, rebooted, or fails. The failures can be due to unexpected issues with power, network, underlying infrastructure, or intentional cases where the cluster is restarted after shutting it down to save costs. The remaining two control plane nodes must handle the load in order to be highly available, which leads to increase in the resource usage. This is also expected during upgrades because the control plane nodes are cordoned, drained, and rebooted serially to apply the operating system updates, as well as the control plane Operators update. To avoid cascading failures, keep the overall CPU and memory resource usage on the control plane nodes to at most 60% of all available capacity to handle the resource usage spikes. Increase the CPU and memory on the control plane nodes accordingly to avoid potential downtime due to lack of resources.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The node sizing varies depending on the number of nodes and object counts in the cluster. It also depends on whether the objects are actively being created on the cluster. During object creation, the control plane is more active in terms of resource usage compared to when the objects are in the `running` phase.
====

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM ) runs on the control plane nodes and its memory footprint depends on the number of namespaces and user installed operators that OLM needs to manage on the cluster. Control plane nodes need to be sized accordingly to avoid OOM kills. Following data points are based on the results from cluster maximums testing.

[options="header",cols="3*"]

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can modify the control plane node size in a running {product-title} {product-version} cluster for the following configurations only:

* Clusters installed with a user-provisioned installation method.
* AWS clusters installed with an installer-provisioned infrastructure installation method.
* Clusters that use a control plane machine set to manage control plane machines.

For all other configurations, you must estimate your total node count and use the suggested control plane node size during installation.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The recommendations are based on the data points captured on {product-title} clusters with OpenShift SDN as the network plugin.
====

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} {product-version}, half of a CPU core (500 millicore) is now reserved by the system by default compared to {product-title} 3.11 and previous versions. The sizes are determined taking that into consideration.

=== Selecting a larger Amazon Web Services instance type for control plane machines

If the control plane machines in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cluster require more resources, you can select a larger AWS instance type for the control plane machines to use.

[NOTE]
====
The procedure for clusters that use a control plane machine set is different from the procedure for clusters that do not use a control plane machine set.

If you are uncertain about the state of the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` CR in your cluster, you can xref:../../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-getting-started.adoc#cpmso-checking-status_cpmso-getting-started[verify the CR status].

[id="cpms-changing-aws-instance-type_{context}"]
= Changing the Amazon Web Services instance type by using a control plane machine set

You can change the Amazon Web Services (AWS) instance type that your control plane machines use by updating the specification in the control plane machine set custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* Your AWS cluster uses a control plane machine set.

.Procedure

. Edit your control plane machine set CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --namespace openshift-machine-api edit controlplanemachineset.machine.openshift.io cluster
----

. Edit the following line under the `providerSpec` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
providerSpec:
  value:
    ...
    instanceType: <compatible_aws_instance_type> <1>
----
<1> Specify a larger AWS instance type with the same base as the previous selection. For example, you can change `m6i.xlarge` to `m6i.2xlarge` or `m6i.4xlarge`.

. Save your changes.

** For clusters that use the default `RollingUpdate` update strategy, the Operator automatically propagates the changes to your control plane configuration.

** For clusters that are configured to use the `OnDelete` update strategy, you must replace your control plane machines manually.

[id="aws-console-changing-aws-instance-type_{context}"]
= Changing the Amazon Web Services instance type by using the AWS console

You can change the Amazon Web Services (AWS) instance type that your control plane machines use by updating the instance type in the AWS console.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the AWS console with the permissions required to modify the EC2 Instance for your cluster.
* You have access to the {product-title} cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Open the AWS console and fetch the instances for the control plane machines.

. Choose one control plane machine instance.

.. For the selected control plane machine, back up the etcd data by creating an etcd snapshot. For more information, see "Backing up etcd".

.. In the AWS console, stop the control plane machine instance.

.. Select the stopped instance, and click *Actions* -> *Instance Settings* -> *Change instance type*.

.. Change the instance to a larger type, ensuring that the type is the same base as the previous selection, and apply changes. For example, you can change `m6i.xlarge` to `m6i.2xlarge` or `m6i.4xlarge`.

.. Start the instance.

.. If your {product-title} cluster has a corresponding `Machine` object for the instance, update the instance type of the object to match the instance type set in the AWS console.

. Repeat this process for each control plane machine.

[id="infrastructure-node-sizing_{context}"]
=  Infrastructure node sizing

_Infrastructure nodes_ are nodes that are labeled to run pieces of the {product-title} environment. The infrastructure node resource requirements depend on the cluster age, nodes, and objects in the cluster, as these factors can lead to an increase in the number of metrics or time series in Prometheus. The following infrastructure node size recommendations are based on the results observed in cluster-density testing detailed in the *Control plane node sizing* section, where the monitoring stack and the default ingress-controller were moved to these nodes.

[options="header",cols="4*"]
|===
| Number of worker nodes |Cluster density, or number of namespaces |CPU cores |Memory (GB)

| 27
| 500
| 4
| 24

| 120
| 1000
| 8
| 48

| 252
| 4000
| 16
| 128

| 501
| 4000
| 32
| 128

|===

In general, three infrastructure nodes are recommended per cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These sizing recommendations should be used as a guideline. Prometheus is a highly memory intensive application; the resource usage depends on various factors including the number of nodes, objects, the Prometheus metrics scraping interval, metrics or time series, and the age of the cluster. In addition, the router resource usage can also be affected by the number of routes and the amount/type of inbound requests.

These recommendations apply only to infrastructure nodes hosting Monitoring, Ingress and Registry infrastructure components installed during cluster creation.
====

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} {product-version}, half of a CPU core (500 millicore) is now reserved by the system by default compared to {product-title} 3.11 and previous versions. This influences the stated sizing recommendations.

== Scaling the Cluster Monitoring Operator

{product-title} exposes metrics that the Cluster Monitoring Operator collects and stores in the Prometheus-based monitoring stack. As an administrator, you can view dashboards for system resources, containers, and components metrics in the {product-title} web console by navigating to *Observe* -> *Dashboards*.

[id="prometheus-database-storage-requirements_{context}"]
= Prometheus database storage requirements

Red Hat performed various tests for different scale sizes.

[NOTE]
====
The Prometheus storage requirements below are not prescriptive and should be used as a reference. Higher resource consumption might be observed in your cluster depending on workload activity and resource density, including the number of pods, containers, routes, or other resources exposing metrics collected by Prometheus.
====

.Prometheus Database storage requirements based on number of nodes/pods in the cluster
[options="header"]
|===
|Number of Nodes |Number of pods (2 containers per pod) |Prometheus storage growth per day |Prometheus storage growth per 15 days |Network (per tsdb chunk)

|50
|1800
|6.3 GB
|94 GB
|16 MB

|100
|3600
|13 GB
|195 GB
|26 MB

|150
|5400
|19 GB
|283 GB
|36 MB

|200
|7200
|25 GB
|375 GB
|46 MB
|===

Approximately 20 percent of the expected size was added as overhead to ensure that the storage requirements do not exceed the calculated value.

The above calculation is for the default {product-title} Cluster Monitoring Operator.

[NOTE]
====
CPU utilization has minor impact. The ratio is approximately 1 core out of 40 per 50 nodes and 1800 pods.
====

*Recommendations for {product-title}*

* Use at least two infrastructure (infra) nodes.
* Use at least three *openshift-container-storage* nodes with non-volatile memory express (SSD or NVMe) drives.

[id="configuring-cluster-monitoring_{context}"]
= Configuring cluster monitoring

[role="_abstract"]
You can increase the storage capacity for the Prometheus component in the cluster monitoring stack.

.Procedure

To increase the storage capacity for Prometheus:

. Create a YAML configuration file, `cluster-monitoring-config.yaml`. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      retention: {{PROMETHEUS_RETENTION_PERIOD}} <1>
      nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          storageClassName: {{STORAGE_CLASS}} <2>
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: {{PROMETHEUS_STORAGE_SIZE}} <3>
    alertmanagerMain:
      nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          storageClassName: {{STORAGE_CLASS}} <2>
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: {{ALERTMANAGER_STORAGE_SIZE}} <4>
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
----
<1> The default value of Prometheus retention is `PROMETHEUS_RETENTION_PERIOD=15d`. Units are measured in time using one of these suffixes: s, m, h, d.
<2> The storage class for your cluster.
<3> A typical value is `PROMETHEUS_STORAGE_SIZE=2000Gi`. Storage values can be a plain integer or a fixed-point integer using one of these suffixes: E, P, T, G, M, K. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents: Ei, Pi, Ti, Gi, Mi, Ki.
<4> A typical value is `ALERTMANAGER_STORAGE_SIZE=20Gi`. Storage values can be a plain integer or a fixed-point integer using one of these suffixes: E, P, T, G, M, K. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents: Ei, Pi, Ti, Gi, Mi, Ki.

. Add values for the retention period, storage class, and storage sizes.

. Save the file.

. Apply the changes by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f cluster-monitoring-config.yaml

= Recommended etcd practices

Because etcd writes data to disk and persists proposals on disk, its performance depends on disk performance.
Although etcd is not particularly I/O intensive, it requires a low latency block device for optimal performance and stability. Because etcd's consensus protocol depends on persistently storing metadata to a log (WAL), etcd is sensitive to disk-write latency. Slow disks and disk activity from other processes can cause long fsync latencies.

Those latencies can cause etcd to miss heartbeats, not commit new proposals to the disk on time, and ultimately experience request timeouts and temporary leader loss. High write latencies also lead to an OpenShift API slowness, which affects cluster performance. Because of these reasons, avoid colocating other workloads on the control-plane nodes that are I/O sensitive or intensive and share the same underlying I/O infrastructure.

In terms of latency, run etcd on top of a block device that can write at least 50 IOPS of 8000 bytes long sequentially. That is, with a latency of 10ms, keep in mind that uses fdatasync to synchronize each write in the WAL. For heavy loaded clusters, sequential 500 IOPS of 8000 bytes (2 ms) are recommended. To measure those numbers, you can use a benchmarking tool, such as fio.

To achieve such performance, run etcd on machines that are backed by SSD or NVMe disks with low latency and high throughput. Consider single-level cell (SLC) solid-state drives (SSDs), which provide 1 bit per memory cell, are durable and reliable, and are ideal for write-intensive workloads.

[NOTE]
====
The load on etcd arises from static factors, such as the number of nodes and pods, and dynamic factors, including changes in endpoints due to pod autoscaling, pod restarts, job executions, and other workload-related events. To accurately size your etcd setup, you must analyze the specific requirements of your workload. Consider the number of nodes, pods, and other relevant factors that impact the load on etcd.
====

The following hard disk features provide optimal etcd performance:

* Low latency to support fast read operation.
* High-bandwidth writes for faster compactions and defragmentation.
* High-bandwidth reads for faster recovery from failures.
* Solid state drives as a minimum selection, however NVMe drives are preferred.
* Server-grade hardware from various manufacturers for increased reliability.
* RAID 0 technology for increased performance.
* Dedicated etcd drives. Do not place log files or other heavy workloads on etcd drives.

[NOTE]
====
Avoid NAS or SAN setups and spinning drives. Ceph Rados Block Device (RBD) and other types of network-attached storage can result in unpredictable network latency. To provide fast storage to etcd nodes at scale, use PCI passthrough to pass NVM devices directly to the nodes.
====

Always benchmark by using utilities such as fio. You can use such utilities to continuously monitor the cluster performance as it increases.

[NOTE]
====
Avoid using the Network File System (NFS) protocol or other network based file systems.
====

Some key metrics to monitor on a deployed {product-title} cluster are p99 of etcd disk write ahead log duration and the number of etcd leader changes. Use Prometheus to track these metrics.

[NOTE]
====
The etcd member database sizes can vary in a cluster during normal operations. This difference does not affect cluster upgrades, even if the leader size is different from the other members.
====

To validate the hardware for etcd before or after you create the {product-title} cluster, you can use fio.

.Prerequisites

* Container runtimes such as Podman or Docker are installed on the machine that you're testing.
* Data is written to the `/var/lib/etcd` path.

.Procedure
* Run fio and analyze the results:
+
--
** If you use Podman, run this command:
[source,terminal]
+
----
$ sudo podman run --volume /var/lib/etcd:/var/lib/etcd:Z quay.io/cloud-bulldozer/etcd-perf
----

** If you use Docker, run this command:
[source,terminal]
+
----
$ sudo docker run --volume /var/lib/etcd:/var/lib/etcd:Z quay.io/cloud-bulldozer/etcd-perf
----
--

The output reports whether the disk is fast enough to host etcd by comparing the 99th percentile of the fsync metric captured from the run to see if it is less than 10 ms. A few of the most important etcd metrics that might affected by I/O performance are as follow:

* `etcd_disk_wal_fsync_duration_seconds_bucket` metric reports the etcd's WAL fsync duration
* `etcd_disk_backend_commit_duration_seconds_bucket`  metric reports the etcd backend commit latency duration
* `etcd_server_leader_changes_seen_total` metric reports the leader changes

Because etcd replicates the requests among all the members, its performance strongly depends on network input/output (I/O) latency. High network latencies result in etcd heartbeats taking longer than the election timeout, which results in leader elections that are disruptive to the cluster. A key metric to monitor on a deployed {product-title} cluster is the 99th percentile of etcd network peer latency on each etcd cluster member. Use Prometheus to track the metric.

The `histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(etcd_network_peer_round_trip_time_seconds_bucket[2m]))` metric reports the round trip time for etcd to finish replicating the client requests between the members. Ensure that it is less than 50 ms.

[id="move-etcd-different-disk_{context}"]
= Moving etcd to a different disk

You can move etcd from a shared disk to a separate disk to prevent or resolve performance issues.

The Machine Config Operator (MCO) is responsible for mounting a secondary disk for {product-title} {product-version} container storage.

[NOTE]
====
This procedure does not move parts of the root file system, such as `/var/`, to another disk or partition on an installed node.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.
* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* The `MachineConfigPool` must match `metadata.labels[machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role]`. This applies to a controller, worker, or a custom pool.

.Procedure

. Attach the new disk to the cluster and verify that the disk is detected in the node by using the `lsblk` command in a debug shell:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
# lsblk
----
+
Note the device name of the new disk reported by the `lsblk` command.

. Create a `MachineConfig` YAML file named `etcd-mc.yml` with contents such as the following, replacing instances of `<new_disk_name>` with the noted device name:
+

[id="etcd-defrag_{context}"]
= Defragmenting etcd data

For large and dense clusters, etcd can suffer from poor performance if the keyspace grows too large and exceeds the space quota. Periodically maintain and defragment etcd to free up space in the data store. Monitor Prometheus for etcd metrics and defragment it when required; otherwise, etcd can raise a cluster-wide alarm that puts the cluster into a maintenance mode that accepts only key reads and deletes.

Monitor these key metrics:

* `etcd_server_quota_backend_bytes`, which is the current quota limit
* `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_use_in_bytes`, which indicates the actual database usage after a history compaction
* `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes`, which shows the database size, including free space waiting for defragmentation

Defragment etcd data to reclaim disk space after events that cause disk fragmentation, such as etcd history compaction.

History compaction is performed automatically every five minutes and leaves gaps in the back-end database. This fragmented space is available for use by etcd, but is not available to the host file system. You must defragment etcd to make this space available to the host file system.

Defragmentation occurs automatically, but you can also trigger it manually.

[NOTE]
====
Automatic defragmentation is good for most cases, because the etcd operator uses cluster information to determine the most efficient operation for the user.
====

[id="automatic-defrag-etcd-data_{context}"]
== Automatic defragmentation

The etcd Operator automatically defragments disks. No manual intervention is needed.

Verify that the defragmentation process is successful by viewing one of these logs:

* etcd logs
* cluster-etcd-operator pod
* operator status error log

[WARNING]
====
Automatic defragmentation can cause leader election failure in various OpenShift core components, such as the Kubernetes controller manager, which triggers a restart of the failing component. The restart is harmless and either triggers failover to the next running instance or the component resumes work again after the restart.
====

[id="manual-defrag-etcd-data_{context}"]
== Manual defragmentation

//You can monitor the `etcd_db_total_size_in_bytes` metric to determine whether manual defragmentation is necessary.

A Prometheus alert indicates when you need to use manual defragmentation. The alert is displayed in two cases:

   * When etcd uses more than 50% of its available space for more than 10 minutes
   * When etcd is actively using less than 50% of its total database size for more than 10 minutes

You can also determine whether defragmentation is needed by checking the etcd database size in MB that will be freed by defragmentation with the PromQL expression: `(etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes - etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_use_in_bytes)/1024/1024`

[WARNING]
====
Defragmenting etcd is a blocking action. The etcd member will not respond until defragmentation is complete. For this reason, wait at least one minute between defragmentation actions on each of the pods to allow the cluster to recover.
====

Follow this procedure to defragment etcd data on each etcd member.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Determine which etcd member is the leader, because the leader should be defragmented last.

.. Get the list of etcd pods:
+
[source,terminal]

----
+
Based on the `IS LEADER` column of this output, the [x-]`https://10.0.199.170:2379` endpoint is the leader. Matching this endpoint with the output of the previous step, the pod name of the leader is `etcd-ip-10-0-199-170.example.redhat.com`.

. Defragment an etcd member.

.. Connect to the running etcd container, passing in the name of a pod that is _not_ the leader:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-ip-10-0-159-225.example.redhat.com
----

.. Unset the `ETCDCTL_ENDPOINTS` environment variable:

+---------------------------+------------------+---------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+------------+--------------------+--------+
----
This example shows that the database size for this etcd member is now 41 MB as opposed to the starting size of 104 MB.

.. Repeat these steps to connect to each of the other etcd members and defragment them. Always defragment the leader last.
+
Wait at least one minute between defragmentation actions to allow the etcd pod to recover. Until the etcd pod recovers, the etcd member will not respond.

. If any `NOSPACE` alarms were triggered due to the space quota being exceeded, clear them.

.. Check if there are any `NOSPACE` alarms:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# etcdctl alarm list
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
memberID:12345678912345678912 alarm:NOSPACE
----

.. Clear the alarms:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# etcdctl alarm disarm

[id="etcd-tuning-parameters_{context}"]
= Setting tuning parameters for etcd

You can set the control plane hardware speed to `"Standard"`, `"Slower"`, or the default, which is `""`.

The default setting allows the system to decide which speed to use. This value enables upgrades from versions where this feature does not exist, as the system can select values from previous versions.

By selecting one of the other values, you are overriding the default. If you see many leader elections due to timeouts or missed heartbeats and your system is set to `""` or `"Standard"`, set the hardware speed to `"Slower"` to make the system more tolerant to the increased latency.

:FeatureName: Tuning etcd latency tolerances
// When including this file, ensure that {FeatureName} is set immediately before

[IMPORTANT]
====
[subs="attributes+"]
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

[id="etcd-changing-hardware-speed-tolerance_{context}"]
== Changing hardware speed tolerance

To change the hardware speed tolerance for etcd, complete the following steps.

.Prerequisites
* You have edited the cluster instance to enable Technology Preview features. For more information, see "Understanding feature gates".

.Procedure

. Check to see what the current value is by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe etcd/cluster | grep "Control Plane Hardware Speed"
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Control Plane Hardware Speed:  <VALUE>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If the output is empty, the field has not been set and should be considered as the default ("").
====

. Change the value by entering the following command. Replace `<value>` with one of the valid values: `""`, `"Standard"`, or `"Slower"`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc patch etcd/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"controlPlaneHardwareSpeed": "<value>"}}'
----
+
The following table indicates the heartbeat interval and leader election timeout for each profile. These values are subject to change.
+
|===
| Profile | ETCD_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL | ETCD_LEADER_ELECTION_TIMEOUT
| `""` | Varies depending on platform | Varies depending on platform
| `Standard` | 100 | 1000
| `Slower` | 500 | 2500
|===

. Review the output:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
etcd.operator.openshift.io/cluster patched
----
+
If you enter any value besides the valid values, error output is displayed. For example, if you entered `"Faster"` as the value, the output is as follows:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
The Etcd "cluster" is invalid: spec.controlPlaneHardwareSpeed: Unsupported value: "Faster": supported values: "", "Standard", "Slower"
----

. Verify that the value was changed by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe etcd/cluster | grep "Control Plane Hardware Speed"
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Control Plane Hardware Speed:  ""
----

. Wait for etcd pods to roll out:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc get pods -n openshift-etcd -w
----
+
The following output shows the expected entries for master-0. Before you continue, wait until all masters show a status of `4/4 Running`.

Consider the following tested object maximums when you plan your {product-title} cluster.

These guidelines are based on the largest possible cluster. For smaller clusters, the maximums are lower. There are many factors that influence the stated thresholds, including the etcd version or storage data format.

In most cases, exceeding these numbers results in lower overall performance. It does not necessarily mean that the cluster will fail.

[WARNING]
====
Clusters that experience rapid change, such as those with many starting and stopping pods, can have a lower practical maximum size than documented.

= {product-title} tested cluster maximums for major releases

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not provide direct guidance on sizing your {product-title} cluster. This is because determining whether your cluster is within the supported bounds of {product-title} requires careful consideration of all the multidimensional factors that limit the cluster scale.
====

{product-title} supports tested cluster maximums rather than absolute cluster maximums. Not every combination of {product-title} version, control plane workload, and network plugin are tested, so the following table does not represent an absolute expectation of scale for all deployments. It might not be possible to scale to a maximum on all dimensions simultaneously. The table contains tested maximums for specific workload and deployment configurations, and serves as a scale guide as to what can be expected with similar deployments.

1. Pause pods were deployed to stress the control plane components of {product-title} at 2000 node scale. The ability to scale to similar numbers will vary depending upon specific deployment and workload parameters.
2. The pod count displayed here is the number of test pods. The actual number of pods depends on the application's memory, CPU, and storage requirements.
3. This was tested on a cluster with 31 servers: 3 control planes, 2 infrastructure nodes, and 26 worker nodes. If you need 2,500 user pods, you need both a `hostPrefix` of `20`, which allocates a network large enough for each node to contain more than 2000 pods, and a custom kubelet config with `maxPods` set to `2500`. For more information, see link:https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/running-2500-pods-per-node-on-ocp-4.13[Running 2500 pods per node on OCP 4.13].
4. The maximum tested pods per node is 2,500 for clusters using the `OVNKubernetes` network plugin. The maximum tested pods per node for the `OpenShiftSDN` network plugin is 500 pods.
5. When there are a large number of active projects, etcd might suffer from poor performance if the keyspace grows excessively large and exceeds the space quota. Periodic maintenance of etcd, including defragmentation, is highly recommended to free etcd storage.
6. There are several control loops in the system that must iterate over all objects in a given namespace as a reaction to some changes in state. Having a large number of objects of a given type in a single namespace can make those loops expensive and slow down processing given state changes. The limit assumes that the system has enough CPU, memory, and disk to satisfy the application requirements.
7. Each service port and each service back-end has a corresponding entry in `iptables`. The number of back-ends of a given service impact the size of the `Endpoints` objects, which impacts the size of data that is being sent all over the system.
8. Tested on a cluster with 29 servers: 3 control planes, 2 infrastructure nodes, and 24 worker nodes. The cluster had 500 namespaces. {product-title} has a limit of 1,024 total custom resource definitions (CRD), including those installed by {product-title}, products integrating with {product-title} and user-created CRDs. If there are more than 1,024 CRDs created, then there is a possibility that `oc` command requests might be throttled.

== Example scenario

As an example, 500 worker nodes (m5.2xl) were tested, and are supported, using {product-title} {product-version}, the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, and the following workload objects:

* 200 namespaces, in addition to the defaults
* 60 pods per node; 30 server and 30 client pods (30k total)
* 57 image streams/ns (11.4k total)
* 15 services/ns backed by the server pods (3k total)
* 15 routes/ns backed by the previous services (3k total)
* 20 secrets/ns (4k total)
* 10 config maps/ns (2k total)
* 6 network policies/ns, including deny-all, allow-from ingress and intra-namespace rules
* 57 builds/ns

The following factors are known to affect cluster workload scaling, positively or negatively, and should be factored into the scale numbers when planning a deployment.  For additional information and guidance, contact your sales representative or link:https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red Hat support].

* Number of pods per node
* Number of containers per pod
* Type of probes used (for example, liveness/readiness, exec/http)
* Number of network policies
* Number of projects, or namespaces
* Number of image streams per project
* Number of builds per project
* Number of services/endpoints and type
* Number of routes
* Number of shards
* Number of secrets
* Number of config maps
* Rate of API calls, or the cluster “churn”, which is an estimation of how quickly things change in the cluster configuration.
** Prometheus query for pod creation requests per second over 5 minute windows: `sum(irate(apiserver_request_count{resource="pods",verb="POST"}[5m]))`
** Prometheus query for all API requests per second over 5 minute windows: `sum(irate(apiserver_request_count{}[5m]))`
* Cluster node resource consumption of CPU
* Cluster node resource consumption of memory

2. Four compute nodes are used for the tests running several iterations with 100/250/500 pods at the same time. First, idling pods were used to evaluate if pods can be instanced. Next, a network and CPU demanding client/server workload were used to evaluate the stability of the system under stress. Client and server pods were pairwise deployed and each pair was spread over two compute nodes.
3. No separate workload node was used. The workload simulates a microservice workload between two compute nodes.
4. Physical number of processors used is six Integrated Facilities for Linux (IFLs).
5. Total physical memory used is 512 GiB.

[id="how-to-plan-according-to-cluster-maximums_{context}"]
= How to plan your environment according to tested cluster maximums

[IMPORTANT]
====
Oversubscribing the physical resources on a node affects resource guarantees the Kubernetes scheduler makes during pod placement. Learn what measures you can take to avoid memory swapping.

Some of the tested maximums are stretched only in a single dimension. They will vary when many objects are running on the cluster.

The numbers noted in this documentation are based on Red Hat's test methodology, setup, configuration, and tunings. These numbers can vary based on your own individual setup and environments.
====

While planning your environment, determine how many pods are expected to fit per node:

----
required pods per cluster / pods per node = total number of nodes needed
----

The default maximum number of pods per node is 250. However, the number of pods that fit on a node is dependent on the application itself. Consider the application's memory, CPU, and storage requirements, as described in "How to plan your environment according to application requirements".

.Example scenario

If you want to scope your cluster for 2200 pods per cluster, you would need at least five nodes, assuming that there are 500 maximum pods per node:

----
2200 / 500 = 4.4
----

If you increase the number of nodes to 20, then the pod distribution changes to 110 pods per node:

----
2200 / 20 = 110
----

Where:

----
required pods per cluster / total number of nodes = expected pods per node
----

{product-title} comes with several system pods, such as SDN, DNS, Operators, and others, which run across every worker node by default. Therefore, the result of the above formula can vary.

Extrapolated requirements: 550 CPU cores, 450GB RAM, and 1.4TB storage.

Instance size for nodes can be modulated up or down, depending on your
preference. Nodes are often resource overcommitted. In this deployment
scenario, you can choose to run additional smaller nodes or fewer larger nodes
to provide the same amount of resources. Factors such as operational agility and
cost-per-instance should be considered.

Some applications lend themselves well to overcommitted environments, and some
do not. Most Java applications and applications that use huge pages are examples
of applications that would not allow for overcommitment. That memory can not be
used for other applications. In the example above, the environment would be
roughly 30 percent overcommitted, a common ratio.

The application pods can access a service either by using environment variables or DNS.
If using environment variables, for each active service the variables are injected by the
kubelet when a pod is run on a node. A cluster-aware DNS server watches the Kubernetes API
for new services and creates a set of DNS records for each one. If DNS is enabled throughout
your cluster, then all pods should automatically be able to resolve services by their DNS name.
Service discovery using DNS can be used in case you must go beyond 5000 services. When using
environment variables for service discovery, the argument list exceeds the allowed length after
5000 services in a namespace, then the pods and deployments will start failing. Disable the service
links in the deployment's service specification file to overcome this:

The number of application pods that can run in a namespace is dependent on the number of services and the length of the service name when the environment variables are used for service discovery. `ARG_MAX` on the system defines the maximum argument length for a new process and it is set to 2097152 bytes (2 MiB) by default. The Kubelet injects environment variables in to each pod scheduled to run in the namespace including:

* `<SERVICE_NAME>_SERVICE_HOST=<IP>`
* `<SERVICE_NAME>_SERVICE_PORT=<PORT>`
* `<SERVICE_NAME>_PORT=tcp://<IP>:<PORT>`
* `<SERVICE_NAME>_PORT_<PORT>_TCP=tcp://<IP>:<PORT>`
* `<SERVICE_NAME>_PORT_<PORT>_TCP_PROTO=tcp`
* `<SERVICE_NAME>_PORT_<PORT>_TCP_PORT=<PORT>`
* `<SERVICE_NAME>_PORT_<PORT>_TCP_ADDR=<ADDR>`

The pods in the namespace will start to fail if the argument length exceeds the allowed value and the number of
characters in a service name impacts it. For example, in a namespace with 5000 services, the limit on the service name
is 33 characters, which enables you to run 5000 pods in the namespace.

[id="ibm-z-managing-cpu-overcommitment_{context}"]
= Managing CPU overcommitment

In a highly virtualized {ibm-z-name} environment, you must carefully plan the infrastructure setup and sizing. One of the most important features of virtualization is the capability to do resource overcommitment, allocating more resources to the virtual machines than actually available at the hypervisor level. This is very workload dependent and there is no golden rule that can be applied to all setups.

Depending on your setup, consider these best practices regarding CPU overcommitment:

* At LPAR level (PR/SM hypervisor), avoid assigning all available physical cores (IFLs) to each LPAR. For example, with four physical IFLs available, you should not define three LPARs with four logical IFLs each.
* Check and understand LPAR shares and weights.
* An excessive number of virtual CPUs can adversely affect performance. Do not define more virtual processors to a guest than logical processors are defined to the LPAR.
* Configure the number of virtual processors per guest for peak workload, not more.
* Start small and monitor the workload. Increase the vCPU number incrementally if necessary.
* Not all workloads are suitable for high overcommitment ratios. If the workload is CPU intensive, you will probably not be able to achieve high ratios without performance problems. Workloads that are more I/O intensive can keep consistent performance even with high overcommitment ratios.

= Disable Transparent Huge Pages

Transparent Huge Pages (THP) attempt to automate most aspects of creating, managing, and using huge pages. Since THP automatically manages the huge pages, this is not always handled optimally for all types of workloads. THP can lead to performance regressions, since many applications handle huge pages on their own. Therefore, consider disabling THP.

[id="ibm-z-boost-networking-performance-with-rfs_{context}"]
= Boost networking performance with Receive Flow Steering

Receive Flow Steering (RFS) extends Receive Packet Steering (RPS) by further reducing network latency. RFS is technically based on RPS, and improves the efficiency of packet processing by increasing the CPU cache hit rate. RFS achieves this, and in addition considers queue length, by determining the most convenient CPU for computation so that cache hits are more likely to occur within the CPU. Thus, the CPU cache is invalidated less and requires fewer cycles to rebuild the cache. This can help reduce packet processing run time.

[id="ibm-z-choose-networking-setup_{context}"]
= Choose your networking setup

The networking stack is one of the most important components for a Kubernetes-based product like {product-title}. For {ibm-z-name} setups, the networking setup depends on the hypervisor of your choice. Depending on the workload and the application, the best fit usually changes with the use case and the traffic pattern.

Depending on your setup, consider these best practices:

* Consider all options regarding networking devices to optimize your traffic pattern. Explore the advantages of OSA-Express, RoCE Express, HiperSockets, z/VM VSwitch, Linux Bridge (KVM), and others to decide which option leads to the greatest benefit for your setup.
* Always use the latest available NIC version. For example, OSA Express 7S 10 GbE shows great improvement compared to OSA Express 6S 10 GbE with transactional workload types, although both are 10 GbE adapters.
* Each virtual switch adds an additional layer of latency.
* The load balancer plays an important role for network communication outside the cluster. Consider using a production-grade hardware load balancer if this is critical for your application.
* {product-title} SDN introduces flows and rules, which impact the networking performance. Make sure to consider pod affinities and placements, to benefit from the locality of services where communication is critical.
* Balance the trade-off between performance and functionality.

[id="ibm-z-ensure-high-disk-performance-hyperpav_{context}"]
= Ensure high disk performance with HyperPAV on z/VM

DASD and ECKD devices are commonly used disk types in {ibm-z-name} environments. In a typical {product-title} setup in z/VM environments, DASD disks are commonly used to support the local storage for the nodes. You can set up HyperPAV alias devices to provide more throughput and overall better I/O performance for the DASD disks that support the z/VM guests.

Using HyperPAV for the local storage devices leads to a significant performance benefit. However, you must be aware that there is a trade-off between throughput and CPU costs.

[id="use-the-mco-to-activate-hyperpav-aliases-in-nodes-using-zvm-full-pack-minidisks_{context}"]
== Use the Machine Config Operator (MCO) to activate HyperPAV aliases in nodes using z/VM full-pack minidisks

For z/VM-based {product-title} setups that use full-pack minidisks, you can leverage the advantage of MCO profiles by activating HyperPAV aliases in all of the nodes. You must add YAML configurations for both control plane and compute nodes.

.Procedure

[id="ibm-z-rhel-kvm-host-recommendations_{context}"]
= {op-system-base} KVM on {ibm-z-title} host recommendations

Optimizing a KVM virtual server environment strongly depends on the workloads of the virtual servers and on the available resources. The same action that enhances performance in one environment can have adverse effects in another. Finding the best balance for a particular setting can be a challenge and often involves experimentation.

The following section introduces some best practices when using {product-title} with {op-system-base} KVM on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name} environments.

[id="use-io-threads-for-your-virtual-block-devices_{context}"]
== Use I/O threads for your virtual block devices

To make virtual block devices use I/O threads, you must configure one or more I/O threads for the virtual server and each virtual block device to use one of these I/O threads.

The following example specifies `<iothreads>3</iothreads>`  to configure three I/O threads, with consecutive decimal thread IDs 1, 2, and 3. The `iothread="2"` parameter specifies the driver element of the disk device to use the I/O thread with ID 2.


.Sample I/O thread specification
[source,xml]
----
...
<domain>
 	<iothreads>3</iothreads><1>
  	 ...
    	<devices>
       ...
          <disk type="block" device="disk"><2>
<driver ... iothread="2"/>
    </disk>
       ...
    	</devices>
   ...
</domain>
----
<1> The number of I/O threads.
<2> The driver element of the disk device.

Threads can increase the performance of I/O operations for disk devices, but they also use memory and CPU resources. You can configure multiple devices to use the same thread. The best mapping of threads to devices depends on the available resources and the workload.

Start with a small number of I/O threads. Often, a single I/O thread for all disk devices is sufficient. Do not configure more threads than the number of virtual CPUs, and do not configure idle threads.

You can use the `virsh iothreadadd` command to add I/O threads with specific thread IDs to a running virtual server.

[id="avoid-virtual-scsi-devices_{context}"]
== Avoid virtual SCSI devices

Configure virtual SCSI devices only if you need to address the device through SCSI-specific interfaces. Configure disk space as virtual block devices rather than virtual SCSI devices, regardless of the backing on the host.

However, you might need SCSI-specific interfaces for:

* A LUN for a SCSI-attached tape drive on the host.

* A DVD ISO file on the host file system that is mounted on a virtual DVD drive.

[id="configure-guest-caching-for-disk_{context}"]
== Configure guest caching for disk

Configure your disk devices to do caching by the guest and not by the host.

Ensure that the driver element of the disk device includes the `cache="none"` and `io="native"` parameters.

[source,xml]
----
<disk type="block" device="disk">
    <driver name="qemu" type="raw" cache="none" io="native" iothread="1"/>
...
</disk>
----

[id="exclude-the-memory-ballon-device_{context}"]
== Exclude the memory balloon device

Unless you need a dynamic memory size, do not define a memory balloon device and ensure that libvirt does not create one for you. Include the `memballoon` parameter as a child of the devices element in your domain configuration XML file.

* Check the list of active profiles:
+
[source,xml]
----
<memballoon model="none"/>
----

[id="tune-the-cpu-migration-algorithm-of-the-host-scheduler_{context}"]
== Tune the CPU migration algorithm of the host scheduler

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not change the scheduler settings unless you are an expert who understands the implications. Do not apply changes to production systems without testing them and confirming that they have the intended effect.
====

The `kernel.sched_migration_cost_ns` parameter specifies a time interval in nanoseconds. After the last execution of a task, the CPU cache is considered to have useful content until this interval expires. Increasing this interval results in fewer task migrations. The default value is 500000 ns.

If the CPU idle time is higher than expected when there are runnable processes, try reducing this interval. If tasks bounce between CPUs or nodes too often, try increasing it.

To dynamically set the interval to 60000 ns, enter the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
# sysctl kernel.sched_migration_cost_ns=60000
----

To persistently change the value to 60000 ns, add the following entry to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

[source,config]
----
kernel.sched_migration_cost_ns=60000
----

This setting applies only to KVM hosts with cgroups version 1. To enable CPU hotplug on the host, disable the cgroup controller.
====

.Procedure

. Open `/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf` with an editor of your choice.

. Go to the `cgroup_controllers` line.

. Duplicate the entire line and remove the leading number sign (#) from the copy.

. Remove the `cpuset` entry, as follows:
+
[source,config]
----
cgroup_controllers = [ "cpu", "devices", "memory", "blkio", "cpuacct" ]
----

. For the new setting to take effect, you must restart the libvirtd daemon:

.. Stop all virtual machines.

.. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# systemctl restart libvirtd
----

.. Restart the virtual machines.

This setting persists across host reboots.

[id="tune-the-polling-period-for-idle-virtual-cpus_{context}"]
== Tune the polling period for idle virtual CPUs

When a virtual CPU becomes idle, KVM polls for wakeup conditions for the virtual CPU before allocating the host resource. You can specify the time interval, during which polling takes place in sysfs at `/sys/module/kvm/parameters/halt_poll_ns`. During the specified time, polling reduces the wakeup latency for the virtual CPU at the expense of resource usage. Depending on the workload, a longer or shorter time for polling can be beneficial. The time interval is specified in nanoseconds. The default is 50000 ns.

* To optimize for low CPU consumption, enter a small value or write 0 to disable polling:

+
[source,terminal]
----
# echo 0 > /sys/module/kvm/parameters/halt_poll_ns
----

* To optimize for low latency, for example for transactional workloads, enter a large value:

+
[source,terminal]
----
# echo 80000 > /sys/module/kvm/parameters/halt_poll_ns
----

= About the Node Tuning Operator



The Node Tuning Operator helps you manage node-level tuning by orchestrating the TuneD daemon and achieves low latency performance by using the Performance Profile controller. The majority of high-performance applications require some level of kernel tuning. The Node Tuning Operator provides a unified management interface to users of node-level sysctls and more flexibility to add custom tuning specified by user needs.


The Operator manages the containerized TuneD daemon for {product-title} as a Kubernetes daemon set. It ensures the custom tuning specification is passed to all containerized TuneD daemons running in the cluster in the format that the daemons understand. The daemons run on all nodes in the cluster, one per node.

Node-level settings applied by the containerized TuneD daemon are rolled back on an event that triggers a profile change or when the containerized TuneD daemon is terminated gracefully by receiving and handling a termination signal.

The Node Tuning Operator uses the Performance Profile controller to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for {product-title} applications.

The cluster administrator configures a performance profile to define node-level settings such as the following:

* Updating the kernel to kernel-rt.
* Choosing CPUs for housekeeping.
* Choosing CPUs for running workloads.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, disabling CPU load balancing is not supported by cgroup v2. As a result, you might not get the desired behavior from performance profiles if you have cgroup v2 enabled. Enabling cgroup v2 is not recommended if you are using performance profiles.
====

The Node Tuning Operator is part of a standard {product-title} installation in version 4.1 and later.

[NOTE]
====
In earlier versions of {product-title}, the Performance Addon Operator was used to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for OpenShift applications. In {product-title} 4.11 and later, this functionality is part of the Node Tuning Operator.

Use this process to access an example Node Tuning Operator specification.

.Procedure

 * Run the following command to access an example Node Tuning Operator specification:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc get tuned.tuned.openshift.io/default -o yaml -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
----

The default CR is meant for delivering standard node-level tuning for the {product-title} platform and it can only be modified to set the Operator Management state. Any other custom changes to the default CR will be overwritten by the Operator. For custom tuning, create your own Tuned CRs. Newly created CRs will be combined with the default CR and custom tuning applied to {product-title} nodes based on node or pod labels and profile priorities.

[WARNING]
====
While in certain situations the support for pod labels can be a convenient way of automatically delivering required tuning, this practice is discouraged and strongly advised against, especially in large-scale clusters. The default Tuned CR ships without pod label matching. If a custom profile is created with pod label matching, then the functionality will be enabled at that time. The pod label functionality will be deprecated in future versions of the Node Tuning Operator.

[id="custom-tuning-specification_{context}"]
= Custom tuning specification

The custom resource (CR) for the Operator has two major sections. The first section, `profile:`, is a list of TuneD profiles and their names. The second, `recommend:`, defines the profile selection logic.

Multiple custom tuning specifications can co-exist as multiple CRs in the Operator's namespace. The existence of new CRs or the deletion of old CRs is detected by the Operator. All existing custom tuning specifications are merged and appropriate objects for the containerized TuneD daemons are updated.

*Management state*

The Operator Management state is set by adjusting the default Tuned CR. By default, the Operator is in the Managed state and the `spec.managementState` field is not present in the default Tuned CR. Valid values for the Operator Management state are as follows:

  * Managed: the Operator will update its operands as configuration resources are updated
  * Unmanaged: the Operator will ignore changes to the configuration resources
  * Removed: the Operator will remove its operands and resources the Operator provisioned

*Profile data*

The `profile:` section lists TuneD profiles and their names.

[source,yaml]
----

    [main]
    summary=Description of tuned_profile_n profile

    # tuned_profile_n profile settings

*Recommended profiles*

The `profile:` selection logic is defined by the `recommend:` section of the CR. The `recommend:` section is a list of items to recommend the profiles based on a selection criteria.

[source,yaml]
----
recommend:
<recommend-item-1>
# ...
<recommend-item-n>
----

The individual items of the list:

[source,yaml]
----
- machineConfigLabels: <1>
    <mcLabels> <2>
  match: <3>
    <match> <4>
  priority: <priority> <5>
  profile: <tuned_profile_name> <6>
  operand: <7>
    debug: <bool> <8>
    tunedConfig:
      reapply_sysctl: <bool> <9>
----
<1> Optional.
<2> A dictionary of key/value `MachineConfig` labels. The keys must be unique.
<3> If omitted, profile match is assumed unless a profile with a higher priority matches first or `machineConfigLabels` is set.
<4> An optional list.
<5> Profile ordering priority. Lower numbers mean higher priority (`0` is the highest priority).
<6> A TuneD profile to apply on a match. For example `tuned_profile_1`.
<7> Optional operand configuration.
<8> Turn debugging on or off for the TuneD daemon. Options are `true` for on or `false` for off. The default is `false`.
<9> Turn `reapply_sysctl` functionality on or off for the TuneD daemon. Options are `true` for on and `false` for off.

`<match>` is an optional list recursively defined as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
- label: <label_name> <1>
  value: <label_value> <2>
  type: <label_type> <3>
    <match> <4>
----
<1> Node or pod label name.
<2> Optional node or pod label value. If omitted, the presence of `<label_name>` is enough to match.
<3> Optional object type (`node` or `pod`). If omitted, `node` is assumed.
<4> An optional `<match>` list.

If `<match>` is not omitted, all nested `<match>` sections must also evaluate to `true`. Otherwise, `false` is assumed and the profile with the respective `<match>` section will not be applied or recommended. Therefore, the nesting (child `<match>` sections) works as logical AND operator. Conversely, if any item of the `<match>` list matches, the entire `<match>` list evaluates to `true`. Therefore, the list acts as logical OR operator.

If `machineConfigLabels` is defined, machine config pool based matching is turned on for the given `recommend:` list item. `<mcLabels>` specifies the labels for a machine config. The machine config is created automatically to apply host settings, such as kernel boot parameters, for the profile `<tuned_profile_name>`. This involves finding all machine config pools with machine config selector matching `<mcLabels>` and setting the profile `<tuned_profile_name>` on all nodes that are assigned the found machine config pools. To target nodes that have both master and worker roles, you must use the master role.

The list items `match` and `machineConfigLabels` are connected by the logical OR operator. The `match` item is evaluated first in a short-circuit manner. Therefore, if it evaluates to `true`, the `machineConfigLabels` item is not considered.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using machine config pool based matching, it is advised to group nodes with the same hardware configuration into the same machine config pool. Not following this practice might result in TuneD operands calculating conflicting kernel parameters for two or more nodes sharing the same machine config pool.
====
.Example: Node or pod label based matching

[source,yaml]
----
- match:
  - label: tuned.openshift.io/elasticsearch
    match:
    - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
    type: pod
  priority: 10
  profile: openshift-control-plane-es
- match:
  - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
  - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
  priority: 20
  profile: openshift-control-plane
- priority: 30
  profile: openshift-node
----

The CR above is translated for the containerized TuneD daemon into its `recommend.conf` file based on the profile priorities. The profile with the highest priority (`10`) is `openshift-control-plane-es` and, therefore, it is considered first. The containerized TuneD daemon running on a given node looks to see if there is a pod running on the same node with the `tuned.openshift.io/elasticsearch` label set. If not, the entire `<match>` section evaluates as `false`. If there is such a pod with the label, in order for the `<match>` section to evaluate to `true`, the node label also needs to be `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` or `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra`.

If the labels for the profile with priority `10` matched, `openshift-control-plane-es` profile is applied and no other profile is considered. If the node/pod label combination did not match, the second highest priority profile (`openshift-control-plane`) is considered. This profile is applied if the containerized TuneD pod runs on a node with labels `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` or `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra`.

Finally, the profile `openshift-node` has the lowest priority of `30`. It lacks the `<match>` section and, therefore, will always match. It acts as a profile catch-all to set `openshift-node` profile, if no other profile with higher priority matches on a given node.

*Cloud provider-specific TuneD profiles*

With this functionality, all Cloud provider-specific nodes can conveniently be assigned a TuneD profile specifically tailored to a given Cloud provider on a {product-title} cluster. This can be accomplished without adding additional node labels or grouping nodes into
machine config pools.

This functionality takes advantage of `spec.providerID` node object values in the form of `<cloud-provider>://<cloud-provider-specific-id>` and writes the file `/var/lib/tuned/provider` with the value `<cloud-provider>` in NTO operand containers.  The content of this file is then used by TuneD to load `provider-<cloud-provider>` profile if such profile exists.

The `openshift` profile that both `openshift-control-plane` and `openshift-node` profiles inherit settings from is now updated to use this functionality through the use of conditional profile loading. Neither NTO nor TuneD currently include any Cloud provider-specific profiles. However, it is possible to create a custom profile `provider-<cloud-provider>` that will be applied to all Cloud provider-specific cluster nodes.

.Example GCE Cloud provider profile
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tuned.openshift.io/v1

      # Your tuning for GCE Cloud provider goes here.
    name: provider-gce
----

[NOTE]
====
Due to profile inheritance, any setting specified in the `provider-<cloud-provider>` profile will be overwritten by the `openshift` profile and its child profiles.

*Using TuneD profiles from the default CR*

The following CR applies custom node-level tuning for
{product-title} nodes with label
`tuned.openshift.io/ingress-node-label` set to any value.

.Example: custom tuning using the openshift-control-plane TuneD profile
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tuned.openshift.io/v1
kind: Tuned
metadata:
  name: ingress
  namespace: openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
spec:
  profile:
  - data: |
      [main]
      summary=A custom OpenShift ingress profile
      include=openshift-control-plane
      [sysctl]
      net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="1024 65535"
      net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1
    name: openshift-ingress
  recommend:
  - match:
    - label: tuned.openshift.io/ingress-node-label
    priority: 10
    profile: openshift-ingress
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Custom profile writers are strongly encouraged to include the default TuneD
daemon profiles shipped within the default Tuned CR. The example above uses the
default `openshift-control-plane` profile to accomplish this.
====

*Using built-in TuneD profiles*

Given the successful rollout of the NTO-managed daemon set, the TuneD operands
all manage the same version of the TuneD daemon. To list the built-in TuneD
profiles supported by the daemon, query any TuneD pod in the following way:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec $tuned_pod -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator -- find /usr/lib/tuned/ -name tuned.conf -printf '%h\n' | sed 's|^.*/||'
----

You can use the profile names retrieved by this in your custom tuning specification.

.Example: using built-in hpc-compute TuneD profile
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tuned.openshift.io/v1
kind: Tuned
metadata:
  name: openshift-node-hpc-compute
  namespace: openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
spec:
  profile:
  - data: |
      [main]
      summary=Custom OpenShift node profile for HPC compute workloads
      include=openshift-node,hpc-compute
    name: openshift-node-hpc-compute

  recommend:
  - match:
    - label: tuned.openshift.io/openshift-node-hpc-compute
    priority: 20
    profile: openshift-node-hpc-compute
----

In addition to the built-in `hpc-compute` profile, the example above includes
the `openshift-node` TuneD daemon profile shipped within the default
Tuned CR to use OpenShift-specific tuning for compute nodes.

// Note the issues with including profiles sharing the same ancestor: see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1825882[BZ#1825882]

*Overriding host-level sysctls*

Various kernel parameters can be changed at runtime by using `/run/sysctl.d/`, `/etc/sysctl.d/`, and `/etc/sysctl.conf` host configuration files. {product-title} adds several host configuration files which set kernel parameters at runtime; for example, `net.ipv[4-6].`, `fs.inotify.`, and `vm.max_map_count`. These runtime parameters provide basic functional tuning for the system prior to the kubelet and the Operator start.

The Operator does not override these settings unless the `reapply_sysctl` option is set to `false`. Setting this option to `false` results in `TuneD` not applying the settings from the host configuration files after it applies its custom profile.

.Example: overriding host-level sysctls

[id="node-tuning-hosted-cluster_{context}"]
= Configuring node tuning in a hosted cluster

//# Manage node-level tuning with the Node Tuning Operator

To set node-level tuning on the nodes in your hosted cluster, you can use the Node Tuning Operator. In hosted control planes, you can configure node tuning by creating config maps that contain `Tuned` objects and referencing those config maps in your node pools.

.Procedure

. Create a config map that contains a valid tuned manifest, and reference the manifest in a node pool. In the following example, a `Tuned` manifest defines a profile that sets `vm.dirty_ratio` to 55 on nodes that contain the `tuned-1-node-label` node label with any value. Save the following `ConfigMap` manifest in a file named `tuned-1.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: tuned-1
      namespace: clusters
    data:
      tuning: |
        apiVersion: tuned.openshift.io/v1
        kind: Tuned
        metadata:
          name: tuned-1
          namespace: openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
        spec:
          profile:
          - data: |
              [main]
              summary=Custom OpenShift profile
              include=openshift-node
              [sysctl]
              vm.dirty_ratio="55"
            name: tuned-1-profile
          recommend:
          - priority: 20
            profile: tuned-1-profile
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not add any labels to an entry in the `spec.recommend` section of the Tuned spec, node-pool-based matching is assumed, so the highest priority profile in the `spec.recommend` section is applied to nodes in the pool. Although you can achieve more fine-grained node-label-based matching by setting a label value in the Tuned `.spec.recommend.match` section, node labels will not persist during an upgrade unless you set the `.spec.management.upgradeType` value of the node pool to `InPlace`.
====

. Create the `ConfigMap` object in the management cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --kubeconfig="$MGMT_KUBECONFIG" create -f tuned-1.yaml
----

. Reference the `ConfigMap` object in the `spec.tuningConfig` field of the node pool, either by editing a node pool or creating one. In this example, assume that you have only one `NodePool`, named `nodepool-1`, which contains 2 nodes.
+
[source,yaml]
----
    apiVersion: hypershift.openshift.io/v1alpha1
    kind: NodePool
    metadata:
      ...
      name: nodepool-1

    ...
    spec:
      ...
      tuningConfig:
      - name: tuned-1
    status:
    ...
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can reference the same config map in multiple node pools. In hosted control planes, the Node Tuning Operator appends a hash of the node pool name and namespace to the name of the Tuned CRs to distinguish them. Outside of this case, do not create multiple TuneD profiles of the same name in different Tuned CRs for the same hosted cluster.
====

.Verification

Now that you have created the `ConfigMap` object that contains a `Tuned` manifest and referenced it in a `NodePool`, the Node Tuning Operator syncs the `Tuned` objects into the hosted cluster. You can verify which `Tuned` objects are defined and which TuneD profiles are applied to each node.

. List the `Tuned` objects in the hosted cluster:
+
[source,terminal]

----
+
[NOTE]
====
If no custom profiles are created, the `openshift-node` profile is applied by default.
====

. To confirm that the tuning was applied correctly, start a debug shell on a node and check the sysctl values:

= Advanced node tuning for hosted clusters by setting kernel boot parameters

For more advanced tuning in hosted control planes, which requires setting kernel boot parameters, you can also use the Node Tuning Operator. The following example shows how you can create a node pool with huge pages reserved.

.Procedure

. Create a `ConfigMap` object that contains a `Tuned` object manifest for creating 10 huge pages that are 2 MB in size. Save this `ConfigMap` manifest in a file named `tuned-hugepages.yaml`:
+

          - priority: 20
            profile: openshift-node-hugepages
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `.spec.recommend.match` field is intentionally left blank. In this case, this `Tuned` object is applied to all nodes in the node pool where this `ConfigMap` object is referenced. Group nodes with the same hardware configuration into the same node pool. Otherwise, TuneD operands can calculate conflicting kernel parameters for two or more nodes that share the same node pool.
====

. Create the `ConfigMap` object in the management cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --kubeconfig="$MGMT_KUBECONFIG" create -f tuned-hugepages.yaml
----

. Create a `NodePool` manifest YAML file, customize the upgrade type of the `NodePool`, and reference the `ConfigMap` object that you created in the `spec.tuningConfig` section. Create the `NodePool` manifest and save it in a file named `hugepages-nodepool.yaml` by using the `hcp` CLI:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    NODEPOOL_NAME=hugepages-example
    INSTANCE_TYPE=m5.2xlarge
    NODEPOOL_REPLICAS=2

    hcp create nodepool aws \
      --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
      --name $NODEPOOL_NAME \
      --node-count $NODEPOOL_REPLICAS \
      --instance-type $INSTANCE_TYPE \
      --render > hugepages-nodepool.yaml
----

. In the `hugepages-nodepool.yaml` file, set `.spec.management.upgradeType` to `InPlace`, and set `.spec.tuningConfig` to reference the `tuned-hugepages` `ConfigMap` object that you created.
+
[source,yaml]
----
    apiVersion: hypershift.openshift.io/v1alpha1

      management:
        ...
        upgradeType: InPlace
      ...
      tuningConfig:
      - name: tuned-hugepages
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To avoid the unnecessary re-creation of nodes when you apply the new `MachineConfig` objects, set `.spec.management.upgradeType` to `InPlace`. If you use the `Replace` upgrade type, nodes are fully deleted and new nodes can replace them when you apply the new kernel boot parameters that the TuneD operand calculated.
====

. Create the `NodePool` in the management cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --kubeconfig="$MGMT_KUBECONFIG" create -f hugepages-nodepool.yaml
----

.Verification

After the nodes are available, the containerized TuneD daemon calculates the required kernel boot parameters based on the applied TuneD profile. After the nodes are ready and reboot once to apply the generated `MachineConfig` object, you can verify that the TuneD profile is applied and that the kernel boot parameters are set.

. List the `Tuned` objects in the hosted cluster:

CPU Manager manages groups of CPUs and constrains workloads to specific CPUs.

CPU Manager is useful for workloads that have some of these attributes:

* Require as much CPU time as possible.
* Are sensitive to processor cache misses.
* Are low-latency network applications.
* Coordinate with other processes and benefit from sharing a single processor
cache.

Topology Manager collects hints from the CPU Manager, Device Manager, and other Hint Providers to align pod resources, such as CPU, SR-IOV VFs, and other device resources, for all Quality of Service (QoS) classes on the same non-uniform memory access (NUMA) node.

Topology Manager uses topology information from the collected hints to decide if a pod can be accepted or rejected on a node, based on the configured Topology Manager policy and pod resources requested.

Topology Manager is useful for workloads that use hardware accelerators to support latency-critical execution and high throughput parallel computation.

To use Topology Manager you must configure CPU Manager with the `static` policy.

[id="setting_up_cpu_manager_{context}"]
= Setting up CPU Manager

.Procedure

. Optional: Label a node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc label node perf-node.example.com cpumanager=true
----

. Edit the `MachineConfigPool` of the nodes where CPU Manager should be enabled. In this example, all workers have CPU Manager enabled:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc edit machineconfigpool worker
----

. Add a label to the worker machine config pool:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2020-xx-xxx
  generation: 3
  labels:
    custom-kubelet: cpumanager-enabled
----

. Create a `KubeletConfig`, `cpumanager-kubeletconfig.yaml`, custom resource (CR). Refer to the label created in the previous step to have the correct nodes updated with the new kubelet config. See the `machineConfigPoolSelector` section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: cpumanager-enabled
spec:
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      custom-kubelet: cpumanager-enabled
  kubeletConfig:
     cpuManagerPolicy: static <1>
     cpuManagerReconcilePeriod: 5s <2>
----
<1> Specify a policy:
* `none`. This policy explicitly enables the existing default CPU affinity scheme, providing no affinity beyond what the scheduler does automatically. This is the default policy.
* `static`. This policy allows containers in guaranteed pods with integer CPU requests. It also limits access to exclusive CPUs on the node. If `static`, you must use a lowercase `s`.
<2> Optional. Specify the CPU Manager reconcile frequency. The default is `5s`.

. Create the dynamic kubelet config:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc create -f cpumanager-kubeletconfig.yaml
----
+
This adds the CPU Manager feature to the kubelet config and, if needed, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) reboots the node. To enable CPU Manager, a reboot is not needed.

. Check for the merged kubelet config:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc get machineconfig 99-worker-XXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX-XXXXX-kubelet -o json | grep ownerReference -A7
----
+
.Example output
[source,json]

            }
        ]
----

. Check the worker for the updated `kubelet.conf`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc debug node/perf-node.example.com
sh-4.2# cat /host/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf | grep cpuManager
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
cpuManagerPolicy: static        <1>

----
<1> `cpuManagerPolicy` is defined when you create the `KubeletConfig` CR.
<2> `cpuManagerReconcilePeriod` is defined when you create the `KubeletConfig` CR.

. Create a pod that requests a core or multiple cores. Both limits and requests must have their CPU value set to a whole integer. That is the number of cores that will be dedicated to this pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# cat cpumanager-pod.yaml

      limits:
        cpu: 1
        memory: "1G"
  nodeSelector:
    cpumanager: "true"
----

. Create the pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc create -f cpumanager-pod.yaml
----

. Verify that the pod is scheduled to the node that you labeled:

This VM has two CPU cores. The `system-reserved` setting reserves 500 millicores, meaning that half of one core is subtracted from the total capacity of the node to arrive at the `Node Allocatable` amount. You can see that `Allocatable CPU` is 1500 millicores. This means you can run one of the CPU Manager pods since each will take one whole core. A whole core is equivalent to 1000 millicores. If you try to schedule a second pod, the system will accept the pod, but it will never be scheduled:

= Topology Manager policies

Topology Manager aligns `Pod` resources of all Quality of Service (QoS) classes by collecting topology hints from Hint Providers, such as CPU Manager and Device Manager, and using the collected hints to align the `Pod` resources.

Topology Manager supports four allocation policies, which you assign in the `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) named `cpumanager-enabled`:

`none` policy::

This is the default policy and does not perform any topology alignment.

`best-effort` policy::

For each container in a pod with the `best-effort` topology management policy, kubelet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource
availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager stores the preferred NUMA Node affinity for that container. If the affinity is not preferred, Topology Manager stores this and admits the pod to the node.

`restricted` policy::

For each container in a pod with the `restricted` topology management policy, kubelet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource
availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager stores the preferred NUMA Node affinity for that container. If the affinity is not
preferred, Topology Manager rejects this pod from the node, resulting in a pod in a `Terminated` state with a pod admission failure.

`single-numa-node` policy::

For each container in a pod with the `single-numa-node` topology management policy, kubelet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager determines if a single NUMA Node affinity is possible. If it is, the pod is admitted to the node. If a single NUMA Node affinity is not possible, the Topology Manager rejects the pod from the node. This results in a pod in a Terminated state with a pod admission failure.

= Setting up Topology Manager

To use Topology Manager, you must configure an allocation policy in the `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) named `cpumanager-enabled`. This file might exist if you have set up CPU Manager. If the file does not exist, you can create the file.

.Prequisites

* Configure the CPU Manager policy to be `static`.

.Procedure

To activate Topololgy Manager:

. Configure the Topology Manager allocation policy in the custom resource.

[id="pod-interactions-with-topology-manager_{context}"]
= Pod interactions with Topology Manager policies

The example `Pod` specs below help illustrate pod interactions with Topology Manager.

The following pod runs in the `BestEffort` QoS class because no resource requests or limits are specified.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
----

The next pod runs in the `Burstable` QoS class because requests are less than limits.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
      requests:
        memory: "100Mi"
----

If the selected policy is anything other than `none`, Topology Manager would not consider either of these `Pod` specifications.

The last example pod below runs in the Guaranteed QoS class because requests are equal to limits.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
        example.com/device: "1"
      requests:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
        example.com/device: "1"
----

Topology Manager would consider this pod. The Topology Manager would consult the hint providers, which are CPU Manager and Device Manager, to get topology hints for the pod.

Topology Manager will use this information to store the best topology for this container. In the case of this pod, CPU Manager and Device Manager will use this stored information at the resource allocation stage.

Learn about NUMA-aware scheduling and how you can use it to deploy high performance workloads in an {product-title} cluster.

:FeatureName: NUMA-aware scheduling

The NUMA Resources Operator allows you to schedule high-performance workloads in the same NUMA zone. It deploys a node resources exporting agent that reports on available cluster node NUMA resources, and a secondary scheduler that manages the workloads.

= About NUMA-aware scheduling

Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) is a compute platform architecture that allows different CPUs to access different regions of memory at different speeds. NUMA resource topology refers to the locations of CPUs, memory, and PCI devices relative to each other in the compute node. Co-located resources are said to be in the same _NUMA zone_. For high-performance applications, the cluster needs to process pod workloads in a single NUMA zone.

NUMA architecture allows a CPU with multiple memory controllers to use any available memory across CPU complexes, regardless of where the memory is located. This allows for increased flexibility at the expense of performance. A CPU processing a workload using memory that is outside its NUMA zone is slower than a workload processed in a single NUMA zone. Also, for I/O-constrained workloads, the network interface on a distant NUMA zone slows down how quickly information can reach the application. High-performance workloads, such as telecommunications workloads, cannot operate to specification under these conditions. NUMA-aware scheduling aligns the requested cluster compute resources (CPUs, memory, devices) in the same NUMA zone to process latency-sensitive or high-performance workloads efficiently. NUMA-aware scheduling also improves pod density per compute node for greater resource efficiency.

By integrating the Node Tuning Operator's performance profile with NUMA-aware scheduling, you can further configure CPU affinity to optimize performance for latency-sensitive workloads.

The default {product-title} pod scheduler scheduling logic considers the available resources of the entire compute node, not individual NUMA zones. If the most restrictive resource alignment is requested in the kubelet topology manager, error conditions can occur when admitting the pod to a node. Conversely, if the most restrictive resource alignment is not requested, the pod can be admitted to the node without proper resource alignment, leading to worse or unpredictable performance. For example, runaway pod creation with `Topology Affinity Error` statuses can occur when the pod scheduler makes suboptimal scheduling decisions for guaranteed pod workloads by not knowing if the pod's requested resources are available. Scheduling mismatch decisions can cause indefinite pod startup delays. Also, depending on the cluster state and resource allocation, poor pod scheduling decisions can cause extra load on the cluster because of failed startup attempts.

The NUMA Resources Operator deploys a custom NUMA resources secondary scheduler and other resources to mitigate against the shortcomings of the default {product-title} pod scheduler. The following diagram provides a high-level overview of NUMA-aware pod scheduling.

.NUMA-aware scheduling overview
image::216_OpenShift_Topology-aware_Scheduling_0222.png[Diagram of NUMA-aware scheduling that shows how the various components interact with each other in the cluster]

NodeResourceTopology API:: The `NodeResourceTopology` API describes the available NUMA zone resources in each compute node.
NUMA-aware scheduler:: The NUMA-aware secondary scheduler receives information about the available NUMA zones from the `NodeResourceTopology` API and schedules high-performance workloads on a node where it can be optimally processed.
Node topology exporter:: The node topology exporter exposes the available NUMA zone resources for each compute node to the `NodeResourceTopology` API. The node topology exporter daemon tracks the resource allocation from the kubelet by using the `PodResources` API.
PodResources API:: The `PodResources` API is local to each node and exposes the resource topology and available resources to the kubelet.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `List` endpoint of the `PodResources` API exposes exclusive CPUs allocated to a particular container. The API does not expose CPUs that belong to a shared pool.

The `GetAllocatableResources` endpoint exposes allocatable resources available on a node.

====
* Enable the `cacheResyncPeriod` specification to help the NUMA Resource Operator report more exact resource availability by monitoring pending resources on nodes and synchronizing this information in the scheduler cache at a defined interval. This also helps to minimize `Topology Affinity Error` errors because of sub-optimal scheduling decisions. The lower the interval the greater the network load. The `cacheResyncPeriod` specification is disabled by default.

* Setting a value of `Enabled` for the `podsFingerprinting` specification in the `NUMAResourcesOperator` CR is a requirement for the implementation of the `cacheResyncPeriod` specification.

= Scheduling NUMA-aware workloads with manual performance settings

Clusters running latency-sensitive workloads typically feature performance profiles that help to minimize workload latency and optimize performance. However, you can schedule NUMA-aware workloads in a pristine cluster that does not feature a performance profile. The following workflow features a pristine cluster that you can manually configure for performance by using the `KubeletConfig` resource. This is not the typical environment for scheduling NUMA-aware workloads.

[id="cnf-configuring-node-groups-for-the-numaresourcesoperator_{context}"]
= Optional: Configuring polling operations for NUMA resources updates

The daemons controlled by the NUMA Resources Operator in their `nodeGroup` poll resources to retrieve updates about available NUMA resources. You can fine-tune polling operations for these daemons by configuring the `spec.nodeGroups` specification in the `NUMAResourcesOperator` custom resource (CR). This provides advanced control of polling operations. Configure these specifications to improve scheduling behaviour and troubleshoot suboptimal scheduling decisions.

The configuration options are the following:

* `infoRefreshMode`: Determines the trigger condition for polling the kubelet. The NUMA Resources Operator reports the resulting information to the API server.
* `infoRefreshPeriod`: Determines the duration between polling updates.
* `podsFingerprinting`: Determines if point-in-time information for the current set of pods running on a node is exposed in polling updates.
+
[NOTE]
====
`podsFingerprinting` is enabled by default. `podsFingerprinting` is a requirement for the `cacheResyncPeriod` specification in the `NUMAResourcesScheduler` CR. The `cacheResyncPeriod` specification helps to report more exact resource availability by monitoring pending resources on nodes.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

      infoRefreshPeriod: 10s <2>
      podsFingerprinting: Enabled <3>
    name: worker
----
<1> Valid values are `Periodic`, `Events`, `PeriodicAndEvents`. Use `Periodic` to poll the kubelet at intervals that you define in `infoRefreshPeriod`. Use `Events` to poll the kubelet at every pod lifecycle event. Use `PeriodicAndEvents` to enable both methods.
<2> Define the polling interval for `Periodic` or `PeriodicAndEvents` refresh modes. The field is ignored if the refresh mode is `Events`.
<3> Valid values are `Enabled` or `Disabled`. Setting to `Enabled` is a requirement for the `cacheResyncPeriod` specification in the `NUMAResourcesScheduler`.

[id="cnf-checking-numa-aware-scheduler-logs_{context}"]
= Checking the NUMA-aware scheduler logs

Troubleshoot problems with the NUMA-aware scheduler by reviewing the logs. If required, you can increase the scheduler log level by modifying the `spec.logLevel` field of the `NUMAResourcesScheduler` resource. Acceptable values are `Normal`, `Debug`, and `Trace`, with `Trace` being the most verbose option.

[NOTE]
====
To change the log level of the secondary scheduler, delete the running scheduler resource and re-deploy it with the changed log level. The scheduler is unavailable for scheduling new workloads during this downtime.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Delete the currently running `NUMAResourcesScheduler` resource:

.. Get the active `NUMAResourcesScheduler` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get NUMAResourcesScheduler
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

----

.. Delete the secondary scheduler resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete NUMAResourcesScheduler numaresourcesscheduler
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
numaresourcesscheduler.nodetopology.openshift.io "numaresourcesscheduler" deleted
----

. Save the following YAML in the file `nro-scheduler-debug.yaml`. This example changes the log level to `Debug`:

[id="cnf-troubleshooting-resource-topo-exporter_{context}"]
= Troubleshooting the resource topology exporter

Troubleshoot `noderesourcetopologies` objects where unexpected results are occurring by inspecting the corresponding `resource-topology-exporter` logs.

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended that NUMA resource topology exporter instances in the cluster are named for nodes they refer to. For example, a worker node with the name `worker` should have a corresponding `noderesourcetopologies` object called `worker`.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Get the daemonsets managed by the NUMA Resources Operator. Each daemonset has a corresponding `nodeGroup` in the `NUMAResourcesOperator` CR. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get numaresourcesoperators.nodetopology.openshift.io numaresourcesoperator -o jsonpath="{.status.daemonsets[0]}"
----
+
.Example output
[source,json]
----
{"name":"numaresourcesoperator-worker","namespace":"openshift-numaresources"}
----

. Get the label for the daemonset of interest using the value for `name` from the previous step:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ds -n openshift-numaresources numaresourcesoperator-worker -o jsonpath="{.spec.selector.matchLabels}"
----
+
.Example output
[source,json]
----

----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-numaresources -l name=resource-topology -o wide
----

[id="cnf-troubleshooting-missing-rte-config-maps_{context}"]
= Correcting a missing resource topology exporter config map

If you install the NUMA Resources Operator in a cluster with misconfigured cluster settings, in some circumstances, the Operator is shown as active but the logs of the resource topology exporter (RTE) daemon set pods show that the configuration for the RTE is missing, for example:

[source,text]
----
Info: couldn't find configuration in "/etc/resource-topology-exporter/config.yaml"
----

This log message indicates that the `kubeletconfig` with the required configuration was not properly applied in the cluster, resulting in a missing RTE `configmap`. For example, the following cluster is missing a `numaresourcesoperator-worker` `configmap` custom resource (CR):

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmap
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                           DATA   AGE
0e2a6bd3.openshift-kni.io      0      6d21h
kube-root-ca.crt               1      6d21h
openshift-service-ca.crt       1      6d21h
topo-aware-scheduler-config    1      6d18h
----

In a correctly configured cluster, `oc get configmap` also returns a `numaresourcesoperator-worker` `configmap` CR.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {product-title} CLI (`oc`).

* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

* Install the NUMA Resources Operator and deploy the NUMA-aware secondary scheduler.

.Procedure

. Compare the values for `spec.machineConfigPoolSelector.matchLabels` in `kubeletconfig` and
`metadata.labels` in the `MachineConfigPool` (`mcp`) worker CR using the following commands:

..  Check the `kubeletconfig` labels by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get kubeletconfig -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
machineConfigPoolSelector:
  matchLabels:
    cnf-worker-tuning: enabled
----

.. Check the `mcp` labels by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mcp worker -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  machineconfiguration.openshift.io/mco-built-in: ""
  pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: ""
----
+
The `cnf-worker-tuning: enabled` label is not present in the `MachineConfigPool` object.

. Edit the `MachineConfigPool` CR to include the missing label, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit mcp worker -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  machineconfiguration.openshift.io/mco-built-in: ""
  pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: ""
  cnf-worker-tuning: enabled
----

. Apply the label changes and wait for the cluster to apply the updated configuration. Run the following command:

.Verification

* Check that the missing `numaresourcesoperator-worker` `configmap` CR is applied:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmap
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

^3^ Prometheus is the underlying technology used for metrics.

^4^ This does not apply to physical disk, VM physical disk, VMDK, loopback over NFS, AWS EBS, and Azure Disk.

^5^ For metrics, using file storage with the `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode is unreliable. If you use file storage, do not configure the RWX access mode on any persistent volume claims (PVCs) that are configured for use with metrics.

^6^ For logging, review the recommended storage solution in Configuring persistent storage for the log store section. Using NFS storage as a persistent volume or through NAS, such as Gluster, can corrupt the data. Hence, NFS is not supported for Elasticsearch storage and LokiStack log store in {product-title} Logging. You must use one persistent volume type per log store.

^7^ Object storage is not consumed through {product-title}'s PVs or PVCs. Apps must integrate with the object storage REST API.

[NOTE]
====
A scaled registry is an {product-registry} where two or more pod replicas are running.
====

== Specific application storage recommendations

[IMPORTANT]
====
Testing shows issues with using the NFS server on {op-system-base-full} as storage backend for core services. This includes the OpenShift Container Registry and Quay, Prometheus for monitoring storage, and Elasticsearch for logging storage. Therefore, using {op-system-base} NFS to back PVs used by core services is not recommended.

Other NFS implementations on the marketplace might not have these issues. Contact the individual NFS implementation vendor for more information on any testing that was possibly completed against these {product-title} core components.
====

=== Registry

In a non-scaled/high-availability (HA) {product-registry} cluster deployment:

* The storage technology does not have to support RWX access mode.
* The storage technology must ensure read-after-write consistency.
* The preferred storage technology is object storage followed by block storage.
* File storage is not recommended for {product-registry} cluster deployment with production workloads.

=== Scaled registry

In a scaled/HA {product-registry} cluster deployment:

* The storage technology must support RWX access mode.
* The storage technology must ensure read-after-write consistency.
* The preferred storage technology is object storage.
* Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, and OpenStack Swift are supported.
* Object storage should be S3 or Swift compliant.
* For non-cloud platforms, such as vSphere and bare metal installations, the only configurable technology is file storage.
* Block storage is not configurable.

=== Metrics

In an {product-title} hosted metrics cluster deployment:

* The preferred storage technology is block storage.
* Object storage is not configurable.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not recommended to use file storage for a hosted metrics cluster deployment with production workloads.
====

=== Logging

In an {product-title} hosted logging cluster deployment:

* {loki-op}:
** The preferred storage technology is S3 compatible Object storage.
** Block storage is not configurable.

* {es-op}:
** The preferred storage technology is block storage.
** Object storage is not supported.

[NOTE]
====
As of logging version 5.4.3 the {es-op} is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed. As an alternative to using the {es-op} to manage the default log storage, you can use the {loki-op}.
====


=== Applications

Application use cases vary from application to application, as described in the following examples:

* Storage technologies that support dynamic PV provisioning have low mount time latencies, and are not tied to nodes to support a healthy cluster.
* Application developers are responsible for knowing and understanding the storage requirements for their application, and how it works with the provided storage to ensure that issues do not occur when an application scales or interacts with the storage layer.

== Other specific application storage recommendations

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not recommended to use RAID configurations on `Write` intensive workloads, such as `etcd`. If you are running `etcd` with a RAID configuration, you might be at risk of encountering performance issues with your workloads.
====

* {rh-openstack-first} Cinder: {rh-openstack} Cinder tends to be adept in ROX access mode use cases.
* Databases: Databases (RDBMSs, NoSQL DBs, etc.) tend to perform best with dedicated block storage.
* The etcd database must have enough storage and adequate performance capacity to enable a large cluster. Information about monitoring and benchmarking tools to establish ample storage and a high-performance environment is described in _Recommended etcd practices_.

Additional 20-25 GB for every additional 8 GB of memory.
|Growth is limited by capacity for running containers.

|*_/var/lib/kubelet_*
|Ephemeral volume storage for pods. This includes anything external that is mounted into a container at runtime. Includes environment variables, kube secrets, and data volumes not backed by persistent volumes.

[id="optimizing-storage-azure_{context}"]
= Optimizing storage performance for Microsoft Azure

{product-title} and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and faster storage is recommended, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes.

For production Azure clusters and clusters with intensive workloads, the virtual machine operating system disk for control plane machines should be able to sustain a tested and recommended minimum throughput of 5000 IOPS / 200MBps.
This throughput can be provided by having a minimum of 1 TiB Premium SSD (P30).
In Azure and Azure Stack Hub, disk performance is directly dependent on SSD disk sizes. To achieve the throughput supported by a `Standard_D8s_v3` virtual machine, or other similar machine types, and the target of 5000 IOPS, at least a P30 disk is required.

Host caching must be set to `ReadOnly` for low latency and high IOPS and throughput when reading data. Reading data from the cache, which is present either in the VM memory or in the local SSD disk, is much faster than reading from the disk, which is in the blob storage.

[id="baseline-router-performance_{context}"]
= Baseline Ingress Controller (router) performance

The {product-title} Ingress Controller, or router, is the ingress point for ingress traffic for applications and services that are configured using routes and ingresses.

When evaluating a single HAProxy router performance in terms of HTTP requests handled per second, the performance varies depending on many factors. In particular:

* HTTP keep-alive/close mode

* Route type

* TLS session resumption client support

* Number of concurrent connections per target route

* Number of target routes

* Back end server page size

* Underlying infrastructure (network/SDN solution, CPU, and so on)

While performance in your specific environment will vary, Red Hat lab tests on a public cloud instance of size 4 vCPU/16GB RAM. A single HAProxy router handling 100 routes terminated by backends serving 1kB static pages is able to handle the following number of transactions per second.

In HTTP keep-alive mode scenarios:

[cols="3",options="header"]
|===
|*Encryption* |*LoadBalancerService*|*HostNetwork*
|none |21515|29622
|edge |16743|22913
|passthrough |36786|53295
|re-encrypt |21583|25198
|===

In HTTP close (no keep-alive) scenarios:

[cols="3",options="header"]
|===
|*Encryption* |*LoadBalancerService*|*HostNetwork*
|none |5719|8273
|edge |2729|4069
|passthrough |4121|5344
|re-encrypt |2320|2941
|===

The default Ingress Controller configuration was used with the `spec.tuningOptions.threadCount` field set to `4`. Two different endpoint publishing strategies were tested: Load Balancer Service and Host Network. TLS session resumption was used for encrypted routes. With HTTP keep-alive, a single HAProxy router is capable of saturating a 1 Gbit NIC at page sizes as small as 8 kB.

When running on bare metal with modern processors, you can expect roughly twice the performance of the public cloud instance above. This overhead is introduced by the virtualization layer in place on public clouds and holds mostly true for private cloud-based virtualization as well. The following table is a guide to how many applications to use behind the router:

[cols="2,4",options="header"]
|===
|*Number of applications* |*Application type*
|5-10 |static file/web server or caching proxy
|100-1000 |applications generating dynamic content

|===

In general, HAProxy can support routes for up to 1000 applications, depending on the technology in use. Ingress Controller performance might be limited by the
capabilities and performance of the applications behind it, such as language or static versus dynamic content.

Ingress, or router, sharding should be used to serve more routes towards applications and help horizontally scale the routing tier.

:leveloffset: 2

For more information on Ingress sharding, see xref:../../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-ingress-sharding-route-labels_configuring-ingress[Configuring Ingress Controller sharding by using route labels] and xref:../../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-ingress-sharding-namespace-labels_configuring-ingress[Configuring Ingress Controller sharding by using namespace labels].

You can modify the Ingress Controller deployment using the information provided in xref:../../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-ingress-setting-thread-count[Setting Ingress Controller thread count] for threads and xref:../../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-ingress-controller-configuration-parameters_configuring-ingress[Ingress Controller configuration parameters] for timeouts, and other tuning configurations in the Ingress Controller specification.

= Configuring Ingress Controller liveness, readiness, and startup probes

Cluster administrators can configure the timeout values for the kubelet's liveness, readiness, and startup probes for router deployments that are managed by the {product-title} Ingress Controller (router). The liveness and readiness probes of the router use the default timeout value
of 1 second, which is too brief when networking or runtime performance is severely degraded. Probe timeouts can cause unwanted router restarts that interrupt application connections. The ability to set larger timeout values can reduce the risk of unnecessary and unwanted restarts.

You can update the `timeoutSeconds` value on the `livenessProbe`, `readinessProbe`, and `startupProbe` parameters of the router container.

 |The `readinessProbe` reports whether a pod is healthy or unhealthy. When the readiness probe reports an unhealthy pod, then the kubelet marks the pod as not ready to accept traffic. Subsequently, the endpoints for that pod are marked as not ready, and this status propagates to the kube-proxy. On cloud platforms with a configured load balancer, the kube-proxy communicates to the cloud load-balancer not to send traffic to the node with that pod.

 |`startupProbe`
 |The `startupProbe` gives the router pod up to 2 minutes to initialize before the kubelet begins sending the router liveness and readiness probes.  This initialization time can prevent routers with many routes or endpoints from prematurely restarting.
|===


[IMPORTANT]
====
The timeout configuration option is an advanced tuning technique that can be used to work around issues. However, these issues should eventually be diagnosed and possibly a support case or https://issues.redhat.com/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=12332330&summary=Summary&issuetype=1&priority=10200&versions=12385624[Jira issue] opened for any issues that causes probes to time out.
====

The following example demonstrates how you can directly patch the default router deployment to set a 5-second timeout for the liveness and readiness probes:


[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-ingress patch deploy/router-default --type=strategic --patch='{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"router","livenessProbe":{"timeoutSeconds":5},"readinessProbe":{"timeoutSeconds":5}}]}}}}'
----

.Verification
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-ingress describe deploy/router-default | grep -e Liveness: -e Readiness:
    Liveness:   http-get http://:1936/healthz delay=0s timeout=5s period=10s #success=1 #failure=3
    Readiness:  http-get http://:1936/healthz/ready delay=0s timeout=5s period=10s #success=1 #failure=3

[id="configuring-haproxy-interval_{context}"]
= Configuring HAProxy reload interval

When you update a route or an endpoint associated with a route, {product-title} router updates the configuration for HAProxy. Then, HAProxy reloads the updated configuration for those changes to take effect. When HAProxy reloads, it generates a new process that handles new connections using the updated configuration.

HAProxy keeps the old process running to handle existing connections until those connections are all closed. When old processes have long-lived connections, these processes can accumulate and consume resources.

The default minimum HAProxy reload interval is five seconds. You can configure an Ingress Controller using its `spec.tuningOptions.reloadInterval` field to set a longer minimum reload interval.

[WARNING]
====
Setting a large value for the minimum HAProxy reload interval can cause latency in observing updates to routes and their endpoints. To lessen the risk, avoid setting a value larger than the tolerable latency for updates.
====

.Procedure

* Change the minimum HAProxy reload interval of the default Ingress Controller to 15 seconds by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]

$ oc -n openshift-ingress-operator patch ingresscontrollers/default --type=merge --patch='{"spec":{"tuningOptions":{"reloadInterval":"15s"}}}'

The xref:../../networking/openshift_sdn/about-openshift-sdn.adoc#about-openshift-sdn[OpenShift SDN] uses OpenvSwitch, virtual extensible LAN (VXLAN) tunnels, OpenFlow rules, and iptables. This network can be tuned by using jumbo frames, network interface controllers (NIC) offloads, multi-queue, and ethtool settings.

xref:../../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes] uses Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) instead of VXLAN as the tunnel protocol.

VXLAN provides benefits over VLANs, such as an increase in networks from 4096 to over 16 million, and layer 2 connectivity across physical networks. This allows for all pods behind a service to communicate with each other, even if they are running on different systems.

VXLAN encapsulates all tunneled traffic in user datagram protocol (UDP) packets. However, this leads to increased CPU utilization. Both these outer- and
inner-packets are subject to normal checksumming rules to guarantee data is not corrupted during transit. Depending on CPU performance, this additional
processing overhead can cause a reduction in throughput and increased latency when compared to traditional, non-overlay networks.

Cloud, VM, and bare metal CPU performance can be capable of handling much more than one Gbps network throughput. When using higher bandwidth links such as 10 or 40 Gbps, reduced performance can occur. This is a known issue in VXLAN-based environments and is not specific to containers or {product-title}. Any network that relies on VXLAN tunnels will perform similarly because of the VXLAN implementation.

If you are looking to push beyond one Gbps, you can:

* Evaluate network plugins that implement different routing techniques, such as border gateway protocol (BGP).
* Use VXLAN-offload capable network adapters. VXLAN-offload moves the packet checksum calculation and associated CPU overhead off of the system CPU and onto dedicated hardware on the network adapter. This frees up CPU cycles for use by pods and applications, and allows users to utilize the full bandwidth of their network infrastructure.

VXLAN-offload does not reduce latency. However, CPU utilization is reduced even in latency tests.

[id="optimizing-mtu_{context}"]
= Optimizing the MTU for your network

There are two important maximum transmission units (MTUs): the network interface controller (NIC) MTU and the cluster network MTU.

The NIC MTU is only configured at the time of {product-title} installation. The MTU must be less than or equal to the maximum supported value of the NIC of your network. If you are optimizing for throughput, choose the largest possible value. If you are optimizing for lowest latency, choose a lower value.

The OpenShift SDN network plugin overlay MTU must be less than the NIC MTU by 50 bytes at a minimum. This accounts for the SDN overlay header. So, on a normal ethernet network, this should be set to `1450`. On a jumbo frame ethernet network, this should be set to `8950`. These values should be set automatically by the Cluster Network Operator based on the NIC's configured MTU. Therefore, cluster administrators do not typically update these values. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and bare-metal environments support jumbo frame ethernet networks. This setting will help throughput, especially with transmission control protocol (TCP).

For OVN and Geneve, the MTU must be less than the NIC MTU by 100 bytes at a minimum.

[NOTE]
====
This 50 byte overlay header is relevant to the OpenShift SDN network plugin. Other SDN solutions might require the value to be more or less.

[id="recommended-install-practices_{context}"]
= Recommended practices for installing large scale clusters

When installing large clusters or scaling the cluster to larger node counts,
set the cluster network `cidr` accordingly in your `install-config.yaml`
file before you install the cluster:

[source,yaml]
----
networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  machineNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
  networkType: OVNKubernetes
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16
----

The default cluster network `cidr` `10.128.0.0/14` cannot be used if the cluster
size is more than 500 nodes. It must be set to `10.128.0.0/12` or
`10.128.0.0/10` to get to larger node counts beyond 500 nodes.

[id="ipsec-impact_{context}"]
= Impact of IPsec

Because encrypting and decrypting node hosts uses CPU power, performance is affected both in throughput and CPU usage on the nodes when encryption is enabled, regardless of the IP security system being used.

IPSec encrypts traffic at the IP payload level, before it hits the NIC, protecting fields that would otherwise be used for NIC offloading. This means that some NIC acceleration features might not be usable when IPSec is enabled and will lead to decreased throughput and increased CPU usage.

toc::[]

You can optimize CPU usage in {product-title} clusters by using mount namespace encapsulation to provide a private namespace for kubelet and CRI-O processes. This reduces the cluster CPU resources used by systemd with no difference in functionality.

:FeatureName: Mount namespace encapsulation
// When including this file, ensure that {FeatureName} is set immediately before

====
[subs="attributes+"]
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

= Encapsulating mount namespaces

Mount namespaces are used to isolate mount points so that processes in different namespaces cannot view each others' files. Encapsulation is the process of moving Kubernetes mount namespaces to an alternative location where they will not be constantly scanned by the host operating system.

The host operating system uses systemd to constantly scan all mount namespaces: both the standard Linux mounts and the numerous mounts that Kubernetes uses to operate. The current implementation of kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level namespace for all container runtime and kubelet mount points. However, encapsulating these container-specific mount points in a private namespace reduces systemd overhead with no difference in functionality. Using a separate mount namespace for both CRI-O and kubelet can encapsulate container-specific mounts from any systemd or other host operating system interaction.

This ability to potentially achieve major CPU optimization is now available to all {product-title} administrators. Encapsulation can also improve security by storing Kubernetes-specific mount points in a location safe from inspection by unprivileged users.

The following diagrams illustrate a Kubernetes installation before and after encapsulation. Both scenarios show example containers which have mount propagation settings of bidirectional, host-to-container, and none.

image::before-k8s-mount-propagation.png[Before encapsulation]

Here we see systemd, host operating system processes, kubelet, and the container runtime sharing a single mount namespace.

* systemd, host operating system processes, kubelet, and the container runtime each have access to and visibility of all mount points.

* Container 1, configured with bidirectional mount propagation, can access systemd and host mounts, kubelet and CRI-O mounts. A mount originating in Container 1, such as `/run/a` is visible to systemd, host operating system processes, kubelet, container runtime, and other containers with host-to-container or bidirectional mount propagation configured (as in Container 2).

* Container 2, configured with host-to-container mount propagation, can access systemd and host mounts, kubelet and CRI-O mounts. A mount originating in Container 2, such as `/run/b`, is not visible to any other context.

* Container 3, configured with no mount propagation, has no visibility of external mount points. A mount originating in Container 3, such as `/run/c`, is not visible to any other context.

The following diagram illustrates the system state after encapsulation.

image::after-k8s-mount-propagation.png[After encapsulation]

* The main systemd process is no longer devoted to unnecessary scanning of Kubernetes-specific mount points. It only monitors systemd-specific and host mount points.

* The host operating system processes can access only the systemd and host mount points.

* Using a separate mount namespace for both CRI-O and kubelet completely separates all container-specific mounts away from any systemd or other host operating system interaction whatsoever.

* The behavior of Container 1 is unchanged, except a mount it creates such as `/run/a` is no longer visible to systemd or host operating system processes. It is still visible to kubelet, CRI-O, and other containers with host-to-container or bidirectional mount propagation configured (like Container 2).

* The behavior of Container 2 and Container 3 is unchanged.

= Configuring mount namespace encapsulation

You can configure mount namespace encapsulation so that a cluster runs with less resource overhead.

[NOTE]
====
Mount namespace encapsulation is a Technology Preview feature and it is disabled by default. To use it, you must enable the feature manually.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a file called `mount_namespace_config.yaml` with the following YAML:

.Verification

To verify encapsulation for a cluster host, run the following commands:

. Open a debug shell to the cluster host:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----

. Open a `chroot` session:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# chroot /host
----

. Check the systemd mount namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# readlink /proc/1/ns/mnt
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
mnt:[4026531953]
----

. Check kubelet mount namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# readlink /proc/$(pgrep kubelet)/ns/mnt
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
mnt:[4026531840]
----

. Check the CRI-O mount namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# readlink /proc/$(pgrep crio)/ns/mnt
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
mnt:[4026531840]
----

These commands return the mount namespaces associated with systemd, kubelet, and the container runtime. In {product-title}, the container runtime is CRI-O.

Encapsulation is in effect if systemd is in a different mount namespace to kubelet and CRI-O as in the above example.
Encapsulation is not in effect if all three processes are in the same mount namespace.

= Inspecting encapsulated namespaces

You can inspect Kubernetes-specific mount points in the cluster host operating system for debugging or auditing purposes by using the `kubensenter` script that is available in {op-system-first}.

SSH shell sessions to the cluster host are in the default namespace.
To inspect Kubernetes-specific mount points in an SSH shell prompt, you need to run the `kubensenter` script as root.
The `kubensenter` script is aware of the state of the mount encapsulation, and is safe to run even if encapsulation is not enabled.

[NOTE]
====
`oc debug` remote shell sessions start inside the Kubernetes namespace by default.
You do not need to run `kubensenter` to inspect mount points when you use `oc debug`.
====

If the encapsulation feature is not enabled, the `kubensenter findmnt` and `findmnt` commands return the same output, regardless of whether they are run in an `oc debug` session or in an SSH shell prompt.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have configured SSH access to the cluster host.

.Procedure

. Open a remote SSH shell to the cluster host. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh core@<node_name>
----

. Run commands using the provided `kubensenter` script as the root user.
To run a single command inside the Kubernetes namespace, provide the command and any arguments to the `kubensenter` script.
For example, to run the `findmnt` command inside the Kubernetes namespace, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[core@control-plane-1 ~]$ sudo kubensenter findmnt
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

= Running additional services in the encapsulated namespace

Any monitoring tool that relies on the ability to run in the host operating system and have visibility of mount points created by kubelet, CRI-O, or containers themselves, must enter the container mount namespace to see these mount points. The `kubensenter` script that is provided with {product-title} executes another command inside the Kubernetes mount point and can be used to adapt any existing tools.

The `kubensenter` script is aware of the state of the mount encapsulation feature status, and is safe to run even if encapsulation is not enabled. In that case the script executes the provided command in the default mount namespace.

For example, if a systemd service needs to run inside the new Kubernetes mount namespace, edit the service file and use the `ExecStart=` command line with `kubensenter`.

When you install {product-title} on a bare metal cluster, you can provision and manage bare metal nodes using `machine` and `machineset` custom resources (CRs) for bare metal hosts that exist in the cluster.

= About bare metal hosts and nodes

To provision a {op-system-first} bare metal host as a node in your cluster, first create a `MachineSet` custom resource (CR) object that corresponds to the bare metal host hardware. Bare metal host compute machine sets describe infrastructure components specific to your configuration. You apply specific Kubernetes labels to these compute machine sets and then update the infrastructure components to run on only those machines.

`Machine` CR's are created automatically when you scale up the relevant `MachineSet` containing a `metal3.io/autoscale-to-hosts` annotation. {product-title} uses `Machine` CR's to provision the bare metal node that corresponds to the host as specified in the `MachineSet` CR.

[id="maintaining-bare-metal-hosts_{context}"]
= Maintaining bare metal hosts

You can maintain the details of the bare metal hosts in your cluster from the {product-title} web console. Navigate to *Compute* -> *Bare Metal Hosts*, and select a task from the *Actions* drop down menu. Here you can manage items such as BMC details, boot MAC address for the host, enable power management, and so on. You can also review the details of the network interfaces and drives for the host.

You can move a bare metal host into maintenance mode. When you move a host into maintenance mode, the scheduler moves all managed workloads off the corresponding bare metal node. No new workloads are scheduled while in maintenance mode.

You can deprovision a bare metal host in the web console. Deprovisioning a host does the following actions:

. Annotates the bare metal host CR with `cluster.k8s.io/delete-machine: true`
. Scales down the related compute machine set

[NOTE]
====
Powering off the host without first moving the daemon set and unmanaged static pods to another node can cause service disruption and loss of data.

= Adding a bare metal host to the cluster using YAML in the web console

You can add bare metal hosts to the cluster in the web console using a YAML file that describes the bare metal host.

.Prerequisites

* Install a {op-system} compute machine on bare metal infrastructure for use in the cluster.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Create a `Secret` CR for the bare metal host.

.Procedure

. In the web console, navigate to *Compute* -> *Bare Metal Hosts*.
. Select *Add Host* -> *New from YAML*.
. Copy and paste the below YAML, modifying the relevant fields with the details of your host:
+

----
+
<1> `credentialsName` must reference a valid `Secret` CR. The `baremetal-operator` cannot manage the bare metal host without a valid `Secret` referenced in the `credentialsName`. For more information about secrets and how to create them, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-secrets.adoc#nodes-pods-secrets-about_nodes-pods-secrets[Understanding secrets].
<2> Setting `disableCertificateVerification` to `true` disables TLS host validation between the cluster and the baseboard management controller (BMC).

. Select *Create* to save the YAML and create the new bare metal host.
. Scale up the number of replicas to match the number of available bare metal hosts. Navigate to *Compute* -> *MachineSets*, and increase the number of machines in the cluster by selecting *Edit Machine count* from the *Actions* drop-down menu.

[id="removing-bare-metal-hosts-from-provisioner_{context}"]
= Removing bare metal hosts from the provisioner node

In certain circumstances, you might want to temporarily remove bare metal hosts from the provisioner node.
For example, during provisioning when a bare metal host reboot is triggered by using the {product-title} administration console or as a result of a Machine Config Pool update, {product-title} logs into the integrated Dell Remote Access Controller (iDrac) and issues a delete of the job queue.

To prevent the management of the number of `Machine` objects that matches the number of available `BareMetalHost` objects, add a `baremetalhost.metal3.io/detached` annotation to the `MachineSet` object.
[NOTE]
====
This annotation has an effect for only `BareMetalHost` objects that are in either `Provisioned`, `ExternallyProvisioned` or `Ready/Available` state.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install {op-system} bare metal compute machines for use in the cluster and create corresponding `BareMetalHost` objects.
* Install the {product-title} CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Annotate the compute machine set that you want to remove from the provisioner node by adding the `baremetalhost.metal3.io/detached` annotation.

[id="about-using-redfish-hardware-events"]
== About bare-metal events

Use the {redfish-operator} to subscribe applications that run in your {product-title} cluster to events that are generated on the underlying bare-metal host. The Redfish service publishes events on a node and transmits them on an advanced message queue to subscribed applications.

Bare-metal events are based on the open Redfish standard that is developed under the guidance of the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). Redfish provides a secure industry-standard protocol with a REST API. The protocol is used for the management of distributed, converged or software-defined resources and infrastructure.

Hardware-related events published through Redfish includes:

* Breaches of temperature limits
* Server status
* Fan status

Begin using bare-metal events by deploying the {redfish-operator} Operator and subscribing your application to the service. The {redfish-operator} Operator installs and manages the lifecycle of the Redfish bare-metal event service.

[NOTE]
====
The {redfish-operator} works only with Redfish-capable devices on single-node clusters provisioned on bare-metal infrastructure.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="nw-rfhe-introduction_{context}"]
= How bare-metal events work

The {redfish-operator} enables applications running on bare-metal clusters to respond quickly to Redfish hardware changes and failures such as breaches of temperature thresholds, fan failure, disk loss, power outages, and memory failure. These hardware events are delivered over a reliable low-latency transport channel based on Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). The latency of the messaging service is between 10 to 20 milliseconds.

The {redfish-operator} provides a publish-subscribe service for the hardware events. Applications can use a REST API to subscribe to the events. The {redfish-operator} supports hardware that complies with Redfish OpenAPI v1.8 or later.

[id="rfhe-elements_{context}"]
== {redfish-operator} data flow

The following figure illustrates an example bare-metal events data flow:

.{redfish-operator} data flow
image::319_OpenShift_redfish_bare-metal_OCP_nodes_0323.png[Bare-metal events data flow]

=== Operator-managed pod

The Operator uses custom resources to manage the pod containing the {redfish-operator} and its components using the `HardwareEvent` CR.

=== {redfish-operator}

At startup, the {redfish-operator} queries the Redfish API and downloads all the message registries, including custom registries. The {redfish-operator} then begins to receive subscribed events from the Redfish hardware.

The {redfish-operator} enables applications running on bare-metal clusters to respond quickly to Redfish hardware changes and failures such as breaches of temperature thresholds, fan failure, disk loss, power outages, and memory failure. The events are reported using the `HardwareEvent` CR.

=== Cloud native event

Cloud native events (CNE) is a REST API specification for defining the format of event data.

=== CNCF CloudEvents

link:https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] is a vendor-neutral specification developed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) for defining the format of event data.

=== HTTP transport or AMQP dispatch router

The HTTP transport or AMQP dispatch router is responsible for the message delivery service between publisher and subscriber.

[NOTE]
====
Use HTTP transport instead of AMQP for PTP and bare-metal events where possible.
AMQ Interconnect is EOL from 30 June 2024.
Extended life cycle support (ELS) for AMQ Interconnect ends 29 November 2029.
For more information see, link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes#p_Interconnect[Red Hat AMQ Interconnect support status].
====

=== Cloud event proxy sidecar

The cloud event proxy sidecar container image is based on the O-RAN API specification and provides a publish-subscribe event framework for hardware events.

[id="rfhe-data-flow_{context}"]
== Redfish message parsing service

In addition to handling Redfish events, the {redfish-operator} provides message parsing for events without a `Message` property. The proxy downloads all the Redfish message registries including vendor specific registries from the hardware when it starts. If an event does not contain a `Message` property, the proxy uses the Redfish message registries to construct the `Message` and `Resolution` properties and add them to the event before passing the event to the cloud events framework. This service allows Redfish events to have smaller message size and lower transmission latency.

== Subscribing to Redfish BMC bare-metal events for a cluster node

You can subscribe to Redfish BMC events generated on a node in your cluster by creating a `BMCEventSubscription` custom resource (CR) for the node, creating a `HardwareEvent` CR for the event, and creating a `Secret` CR for the BMC.

= Subscribing to bare-metal events

You can configure the baseboard management controller (BMC) to send bare-metal events to subscribed applications running in an {product-title} cluster. Example Redfish bare-metal events include an increase in device temperature, or removal of a device. You subscribe applications to bare-metal events using a REST API.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only create a `BMCEventSubscription` custom resource (CR) for physical hardware that supports Redfish and has a vendor interface set to `redfish` or `idrac-redfish`.
====

[NOTE]
====
Use the `BMCEventSubscription` CR to subscribe to predefined Redfish events. The Redfish standard does not provide an option to create specific alerts and thresholds. For example, to receive an alert event when an enclosure's temperature exceeds 40° Celsius, you must manually configure the event according to the vendor's recommendations.
====

Perform the following procedure to subscribe to bare-metal events for the node using a `BMCEventSubscription` CR.

.Prerequisites
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* Get the user name and password for the BMC.

* Deploy a bare-metal node with a Redfish-enabled Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) in your cluster, and enable Redfish events on the BMC.
+
[NOTE]
====
Enabling Redfish events on specific hardware is outside the scope of this information. For more information about enabling Redfish events for your specific hardware, consult the BMC manufacturer documentation.
====

.Procedure

. Confirm that the node hardware has the Redfish `EventService` enabled by running the following `curl` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl https://<bmc_ip_address>/redfish/v1/EventService --insecure -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u "<bmc_username>:<password>"
----
+
where:

--
bmc_ip_address:: is the IP address of the BMC where the Redfish events are generated.

= Creating the bare-metal event and Secret CRs

To start using bare-metal events, create the `HardwareEvent` custom resource (CR) for the host where the Redfish hardware is present. Hardware events and faults are reported in the `hw-event-proxy` logs.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {product-title} CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have installed the {redfish-operator}.

* You have created a `BMCEventSubscription` CR for the BMC Redfish hardware.

= Subscribing applications to bare-metal events REST API reference

Use the bare-metal events REST API to subscribe an application to the bare-metal events that are generated on the parent node.

Subscribe applications to Redfish events by using the resource address `/cluster/node/<node_name>/redfish/event`, where `<node_name>` is the cluster node running the application.

Deploy your `cloud-event-consumer` application container and `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar container in a separate application pod. The `cloud-event-consumer` application subscribes to the `cloud-event-proxy` container in the application pod.

Use the following API endpoints to subscribe the `cloud-event-consumer` application to Redfish events posted by the `cloud-event-proxy` container at [x-]`http://localhost:8089/api/ocloudNotifications/v1/` in the application pod:

* `/api/ocloudNotifications/v1/subscriptions`
- `POST`: Creates a new subscription
- `GET`: Retrieves a list of subscriptions
* `/api/ocloudNotifications/v1/subscriptions/<subscription_id>`
- `PUT`: Creates a new status ping request for the specified subscription ID
* `/api/ocloudNotifications/v1/health`
- `GET`: Returns the health status of `ocloudNotifications` API

[NOTE]
====
`9089` is the default port for the `cloud-event-consumer` container deployed in the application pod. You can configure a different port for your application as required.

[id="cnf-migrating-from-amqp-to-http-transport_{context}"]
= Migrating consumer applications to use HTTP transport for PTP or bare-metal events

If you have previously deployed PTP or bare-metal events consumer applications, you need to update the applications to use HTTP message transport.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have updated the PTP Operator or {redfish-operator} to version 4.13+ which uses HTTP transport by default.

.Procedure

. Update your events consumer application to use HTTP transport.
Set the `http-event-publishers` variable for the cloud event sidecar deployment.
+
For example, in a cluster with PTP events configured, the following YAML snippet illustrates a cloud event sidecar deployment:
+
[source,yaml]
----
containers:
  - name: cloud-event-sidecar
    image: cloud-event-sidecar
    args:
      - "--metrics-addr=127.0.0.1:9091"
      - "--store-path=/store"
      - "--transport-host=consumer-events-subscription-service.cloud-events.svc.cluster.local:9043"
      - "--http-event-publishers=ptp-event-publisher-service-NODE_NAME.openshift-ptp.svc.cluster.local:9043" <1>
      - "--api-port=8089"
----
<1> The PTP Operator automatically resolves `NODE_NAME` to the host that is generating the PTP events.
For example, `compute-1.example.com`.
+
In a cluster with bare-metal events configured, set the `http-event-publishers` field to `hw-event-publisher-service.openshift-bare-metal-events.svc.cluster.local:9043` in the cloud event sidecar deployment CR.

. Deploy the `consumer-events-subscription-service` service alongside the events consumer application.
For example:

[id="what-huge-pages-do_{context}"]
= What huge pages do

Memory is managed in blocks known as pages. On most systems, a page is 4Ki. 1Mi
of memory is equal to 256 pages; 1Gi of memory is 256,000 pages, and so on. CPUs
have a built-in memory management unit that manages a list of these pages in
hardware. The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is a small hardware cache of
virtual-to-physical page mappings. If the virtual address passed in a hardware
instruction can be found in the TLB, the mapping can be determined quickly. If
not, a TLB miss occurs, and the system falls back to slower, software-based
address translation, resulting in performance issues. Since the size of the TLB
is fixed, the only way to reduce the chance of a TLB miss is to increase the
page size.

A huge page is a memory page that is larger than 4Ki. On x86_64 architectures,
there are two common huge page sizes: 2Mi and 1Gi. Sizes vary on other
architectures. To use huge pages, code must be written so that
applications are aware of them. Transparent Huge Pages (THP) attempt to automate
the management of huge pages without application knowledge, but they have
limitations. In particular, they are limited to 2Mi page sizes. THP can lead to
performance degradation on nodes with high memory utilization or fragmentation
due to defragmenting efforts of THP, which can lock memory pages. For this
reason, some applications may be designed to (or recommend) usage of
pre-allocated huge pages instead of THP.

In {product-title}, applications in a pod can allocate and consume pre-allocated
huge pages.

[id="how-huge-pages-are-consumed-by-apps_{context}"]
= How huge pages are consumed by apps

Nodes must pre-allocate huge pages in order for the node to report its huge page
capacity. A node can only pre-allocate huge pages for a single size.

Huge pages can be consumed through container-level resource requirements using the
resource name `hugepages-<size>`, where size is the most compact binary
notation using integer values supported on a particular node. For example, if a
node supports 2048KiB page sizes, it exposes a schedulable resource
`hugepages-2Mi`. Unlike CPU or memory, huge pages do not support over-commitment.

----
<1> Specify the amount of memory for `hugepages` as the exact amount to be
allocated. Do not specify this value as the amount of memory for `hugepages`
multiplied by the size of the page. For example, given a huge page size of 2MB,
if you want to use 100MB of huge-page-backed RAM for your application, then you
would allocate 50 huge pages. {product-title} handles the math for you. As in
the above example, you can specify `100MB` directly.

*Allocating huge pages of a specific size*

Some platforms support multiple huge page sizes. To allocate huge pages of a
specific size, precede the huge pages boot command parameters with a huge page
size selection parameter `hugepagesz=<size>`. The `<size>` value must be
specified in bytes with an optional scale suffix [`kKmMgG`]. The default huge
page size can be defined with the `default_hugepagesz=<size>` boot parameter.

*Huge page requirements*

* Huge page requests must equal the limits. This is the default if limits are
specified, but requests are not.

* Huge pages are isolated at a pod scope. Container isolation is planned in a
future iteration.

* `EmptyDir` volumes backed by huge pages must not consume more huge page memory
than the pod request.

* Applications that consume huge pages via `shmget()` with `SHM_HUGETLB` must run
with a supplemental group that matches *_proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group_*.

[id="consuming-huge-pages-resource-using-the-downward-api_{context}"]
= Consuming huge pages resources using the Downward API

You can use the Downward API to inject information about the huge pages resources that are consumed by a container.

You can inject the resource allocation as environment variables, a volume plugin, or both. Applications that you develop and run in the container can determine the resources that are available by reading the environment variables or files in the specified volumes.

.Procedure

. Create a `{file-name}` file that is similar to the following example:

[id="configuring-huge-pages_{context}"]
= Configuring huge pages at boot time

Nodes must pre-allocate huge pages used in an {product-title} cluster. There are two ways of reserving huge pages: at boot time and at run time. Reserving at boot time increases the possibility of success because the memory has not yet been significantly fragmented. The Node Tuning Operator currently supports boot time allocation of huge pages on specific nodes.

.Procedure

To minimize node reboots, the order of the steps below needs to be followed:

. Label all nodes that need the same huge pages setting by a label.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node_using_hugepages> node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-hp=
----

. Create a file with the following content and name it `hugepages-tuned-boottime.yaml`:

  recommend:
  - machineConfigLabels: <4>
      machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: "worker-hp"
    priority: 30
    profile: openshift-node-hugepages
----
<1> Set the `name` of the Tuned resource to `hugepages`.
<2> Set the `profile` section to allocate huge pages.
<3> Note the order of parameters is important as some platforms support huge pages of various sizes.
<4> Enable machine config pool based matching.

. Create the Tuned `hugepages` object
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f hugepages-tuned-boottime.yaml
----

. Create a file with the following content and name it `hugepages-mcp.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]

  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-hp: ""
----

. Create the machine config pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f hugepages-mcp.yaml
----

Given enough non-fragmented memory, all the nodes in the `worker-hp` machine config pool should now have 50 2Mi huge pages allocated.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get node <node_using_hugepages> -o jsonpath="{.status.allocatable.hugepages-2Mi}"
100Mi
----

[NOTE]
====
The TuneD bootloader plugin only supports {op-system-first} worker nodes.
====

////
For run-time allocation, kubelet changes are needed, see BZ1819719.
== At run time

.Procedure

. Label the node so that the Node Tuning Operator knows on which node to apply the tuned profile, which describes how many huge pages should be allocated:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node_using_hugepages> hugepages=true
----

. Create a file with the following content and name it `hugepages-tuned-runtime.yaml`:
+

    name: node-hugepages

  recommend:
  - match: <3>
    - label: hugepages
    priority: 30
    profile: node-hugepages
----
<1> Set the `name` of the Tuned resource to `hugepages`.
<2> Set the `profile` section to allocate huge pages.
<3> Set the `match` section to associate the profile to nodes with the `hugepages` label.

. Create the custom `hugepages` tuned profile by using the `hugepages-tuned-runtime.yaml` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f hugepages-tuned-runtime.yaml
----

. After creating the profile, the Operator applies the new profile to the correct
node and allocates huge pages. Check the logs of a tuned pod on a node using
huge pages to verify:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs <tuned_pod_on_node_using_hugepages> \
    -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator | grep 'applied$' | tail -n1
----

= Disabling Transparent Huge Pages

Transparent Huge Pages (THP) attempt to automate most aspects of creating, managing, and using huge pages. Since THP automatically manages the huge pages, this is not always handled optimally for all types of workloads. THP can lead to performance regressions, since many applications handle huge pages on their own. Therefore, consider disabling THP. The following steps describe how to disable THP using the Node Tuning Operator (NTO).

.Procedure

  recommend:
  - match:

----
$ oc create -f thp-disable-tuned.yaml
----

. Check the list of active profiles:

= Understanding low latency

The emergence of Edge computing in the area of Telco / 5G plays a key role in reducing latency and congestion problems and improving application performance.

Simply put, latency determines how fast data (packets) moves from the sender to receiver and returns to the sender after processing by the receiver. Maintaining a network architecture with the lowest possible delay of latency speeds is key for meeting the network performance requirements of 5G. Compared to 4G technology, with an average latency of 50 ms, 5G is targeted to reach latency numbers of 1 ms or less. This reduction in latency boosts wireless throughput by a factor of 10.

Many of the deployed applications in the Telco space require low latency that can only tolerate zero packet loss. Tuning for zero packet loss helps mitigate the inherent issues that degrade network performance. For more information, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/tuning-zero-packet-loss-red-hat-openstack-platform-part-1[Tuning for Zero Packet Loss in {rh-openstack-first}].

The Edge computing initiative also comes in to play for reducing latency rates. Think of it as being on the edge of the cloud and closer to the user. This greatly reduces the distance between the user and distant data centers, resulting in reduced application response times and performance latency.

Administrators must be able to manage their many Edge sites and local services in a centralized way so that all of the deployments can run at the lowest possible management cost. They also need an easy way to deploy and configure certain nodes of their cluster for real-time low latency and high-performance purposes. Low latency nodes are useful for applications such as Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) and Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK).

{product-title} currently provides mechanisms to tune software on an {product-title} cluster for real-time running and low latency (around <20 microseconds reaction time). This includes tuning the kernel and {product-title} set values, installing a kernel, and reconfiguring the machine. But this method requires setting up four different Operators and performing many configurations that, when done manually, is complex and could be prone to mistakes.

{product-title} uses the Node Tuning Operator to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for {product-title} applications. The cluster administrator uses this performance profile configuration that makes it easier to make these changes in a more reliable way. The administrator can specify whether to update the kernel to kernel-rt, reserve CPUs for cluster and operating system housekeeping duties, including pod infra containers, and isolate CPUs for application containers to run the workloads.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {product-title} 4.14, if you apply a performance profile to your cluster, all nodes in the cluster will reboot. This reboot includes control plane nodes and worker nodes that were not targeted by the performance profile. This is a known issue in {product-title} 4.14 because this release uses Linux control group version 2 (cgroup v2) in alignment with RHEL 9. The low latency tuning features associated with the performance profile do not support cgroup v2, therefore the nodes reboot to switch back to the cgroup v1 configuration.

To revert all nodes in the cluster to the cgroups v2 configuration, you must edit the `Node` resource. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-16976[*OCPBUGS-16976*])
====

[NOTE]
====
Currently, disabling CPU load balancing is not supported by cgroup v2. As a result, you might not get the desired behavior from performance profiles if you have cgroup v2 enabled. Enabling cgroup v2 is not recommended if you are using performance profiles.
====

{product-title} also supports workload hints for the Node Tuning Operator that can tune the `PerformanceProfile` to meet the demands of different industry environments. Workload hints are available for `highPowerConsumption` (very low latency at the cost of increased power consumption) and `realTime` (priority given to optimum latency). A combination of `true/false` settings for these hints can be used to deal with application-specific workload profiles and requirements.

Workload hints simplify the fine-tuning of performance to industry sector settings. Instead of a “one size fits all” approach, workload hints can cater to usage patterns such as placing priority on:

* Low latency
* Real-time capability
* Efficient use of power

In an ideal world, all of those would be prioritized: in real life, some come at the expense of others. The Node Tuning Operator is now aware of the workload expectations and better able to meet the demands of the workload. The cluster admin can now specify into which use case that workload falls. The Node Tuning Operator uses the `PerformanceProfile` to fine tune the performance settings for the workload.

The environment in which an application is operating influences its behavior. For a typical data center with no strict latency requirements, only minimal default tuning is needed that enables CPU partitioning for some high performance workload pods. For data centers and workloads where latency is a higher priority, measures are still taken to optimize power consumption. The most complicated cases are clusters close to latency-sensitive equipment such as manufacturing machinery and software-defined radios. This last class of deployment is often referred to as Far edge. For Far edge deployments, ultra-low latency is the ultimate priority, and is achieved at the expense of power management.

[id="about_hyperthreading_for_low_latency_and_real_time_applications_{context}"]
= About hyperthreading for low latency and real-time applications

Hyperthreading is an Intel processor technology that allows a physical CPU processor core to function as two logical cores, executing two independent threads simultaneously. Hyperthreading allows for better system throughput for certain workload types where parallel processing is beneficial. The default {product-title} configuration expects hyperthreading to be enabled by default.

For telecommunications applications, it is important to design your application infrastructure to minimize latency as much as possible. Hyperthreading can slow performance times and negatively affect throughput for compute intensive workloads that require low latency. Disabling hyperthreading ensures predictable performance and can decrease processing times for these workloads.

[NOTE]
====
Hyperthreading implementation and configuration differs depending on the hardware you are running {product-title} on. Consult the relevant host hardware tuning information for more details of the hyperthreading implementation specific to that hardware. Disabling hyperthreading can increase the cost per core of the cluster.

= Provisioning real-time and low latency workloads

Many industries and organizations need extremely high performance computing and might require low and predictable latency, especially in the financial and telecommunications industries. For these industries, with their unique requirements, {product-title} provides the Node Tuning Operator to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance and consistent response time for {product-title} applications.

The cluster administrator can use this performance profile configuration to make these changes in a more reliable way. The administrator can specify whether to update the kernel to kernel-rt (real-time), reserve CPUs for cluster and operating system housekeeping duties, including pod infra containers, isolate CPUs for application containers to run the workloads, and disable unused CPUs to reduce power consumption.

[WARNING]
====
The usage of execution probes in conjunction with applications that require guaranteed CPUs can cause latency spikes. It is recommended to use other probes, such as a properly configured set of network probes, as an alternative.
====

[NOTE]
====
In earlier versions of {product-title}, the Performance Addon Operator was used to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for OpenShift applications. In {product-title} 4.11 and later, these functions are part of the Node Tuning Operator.
====

[id="node-tuning-operator-known-limitations-for-real-time_{context}"]
== Known limitations for real-time

[NOTE]
====
In most deployments, kernel-rt is supported only on worker nodes when you use a standard cluster with three control plane nodes and three worker nodes. There are exceptions for compact and single nodes on {product-title} deployments. For installations on a single node, kernel-rt is supported on the single control plane node.
====

To fully utilize the real-time mode, the containers must run with elevated privileges.
See link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-capabilities-for-a-container[Set capabilities for a Container] for information on granting privileges.

{product-title} restricts the allowed capabilities, so you might need to create a `SecurityContext` as well.

[NOTE]
====
This procedure is fully supported with bare metal installations using {op-system-first} systems.
====

Establishing the right performance expectations refers to the fact that the real-time kernel is not a panacea. Its objective is consistent, low-latency determinism offering predictable response times. There is some additional kernel overhead associated with the real-time kernel. This is due primarily to handling hardware interruptions in separately scheduled threads. The increased overhead in some workloads results in some degradation in overall throughput. The exact amount of degradation is very workload dependent, ranging from 0% to 30%. However, it is the cost of determinism.

[id="node-tuning-operator-provisioning-worker-with-real-time-capabilities_{context}"]
== Provisioning a worker with real-time capabilities

. Optional: Add a node to the {product-title} cluster.

. Add the label `worker-rt` to the worker nodes that require the real-time capability by using the `oc` command.

. Create a new machine config pool for real-time nodes:
+

----
Note that a machine config pool worker-rt is created for group of nodes that have the label `worker-rt`.

. Add the node to the proper machine config pool by using node role labels.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must decide which nodes are configured with real-time workloads. You could configure all of the nodes in the cluster, or a subset of the nodes. The Node Tuning Operator that expects all of the nodes are part of a dedicated machine config pool. If you use all of the nodes, you must point the Node Tuning Operator to the worker node role label. If you use a subset, you must group the nodes into a new machine config pool.
====
. Create the `PerformanceProfile` with the proper set of housekeeping cores and `realTimeKernel: enabled: true`.

. You must set `machineConfigPoolSelector` in `PerformanceProfile`:

Use the following procedures for preparing a workload that will use real-time capabilities.

.Procedure

. Create a pod with a QoS class of `Guaranteed`.
. Optional: Disable CPU load balancing for DPDK.
. Assign a proper node selector.

When writing your applications, follow the general recommendations described in

[id="node-tuning-operator-creating-pod-with-guaranteed-qos-class_{context}"]
== Creating a pod with a QoS class of `Guaranteed`

Keep the following in mind when you create a pod that is given a QoS class of `Guaranteed`:

* Every container in the pod must have a memory limit and a memory request, and they must be the same.
* Every container in the pod must have a CPU limit and a CPU request, and they must be the same.

The following example shows the configuration file for a pod that has one container. The container has a memory limit and a memory request, both equal to 200 MiB. The container has a CPU limit and a CPU request, both equal to 1 CPU.

[id="node-tuning-operator-disabling-cpu-load-balancing-for-dpdk_{context}"]
== Optional: Disabling CPU load balancing for DPDK

Functionality to disable or enable CPU load balancing is implemented on the CRI-O level. The code under the CRI-O disables or enables CPU load balancing only when the following requirements are met.

* The pod must use the `performance-<profile-name>` runtime class. You can get the proper name by looking at the status of the performance profile, as shown here:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
...
status:
  ...
  runtimeClass: performance-manual
----

[NOTE]
====
Currently, disabling CPU load balancing is not supported with cgroup v2.
====

The Node Tuning Operator is responsible for the creation of the high-performance runtime handler config snippet under relevant nodes and for creation of the high-performance runtime class under the cluster. It will have the same content as default runtime handler except it enables the CPU load balancing configuration functionality.

To disable the CPU load balancing for the pod, the `Pod` specification must include the following fields:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  ...
  annotations:
    ...
    cpu-load-balancing.crio.io: "disable"

  ...
----

[NOTE]
====
Only disable CPU load balancing when the CPU manager static policy is enabled and for pods with guaranteed QoS that use whole CPUs. Otherwise, disabling CPU load balancing can affect the performance of other containers in the cluster.
====

[id="node-tuning-operator-assigning-proper-node-selector_{context}"]
== Assigning a proper node selector

The preferred way to assign a pod to nodes is to use the same node selector the performance profile used, as shown here:

[id="node-tuning-operator-pod-power-saving-config_{context}"]
== Optional: Power saving configurations

You can enable power savings for a node that has low priority workloads that are colocated with high priority workloads without impacting the latency or throughput of the high priority workloads. Power saving is possible without modifications to the workloads themselves.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The feature is supported on Intel Ice Lake and later generations of Intel CPUs. The capabilities of the processor might impact the latency and throughput of the high priority workloads.
====

When you configure a node with a power saving configuration, you must configure high priority workloads with performance configuration at the pod level, which means that the configuration applies to all the cores used by the pod.

By disabling P-states and C-states at the pod level, you can configure high priority workloads for best performance and lowest latency.

* `"max_latency:microseconds"` | This annotation allows you to enable or disable C-states for each CPU. Alternatively, you can also specify a maximum latency in microseconds for the C-states. For example, enable C-states with a maximum latency of 10 microseconds with the setting `cpu-c-states.crio.io`: `"max_latency:10"`. Set the value to `"disable"` to provide the best performance for a pod.

[id="managing-device-interrupt-processing-for-guaranteed-pod-isolated-cpus_{context}"]
= Managing device interrupt processing for guaranteed pod isolated CPUs

The Node Tuning Operator can manage host CPUs by dividing them into reserved CPUs for cluster and operating system housekeeping duties, including pod infra containers, and isolated CPUs for application containers to run the workloads. This allows you to set CPUs for low latency workloads as isolated.

Device interrupts are load balanced between all isolated and reserved CPUs to avoid CPUs being overloaded, with the exception of CPUs where there is a guaranteed pod running. Guaranteed pod CPUs are prevented from processing device interrupts when the relevant annotations are set for the pod.

In the performance profile, `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` is used to manage whether device interrupts are processed or not. For certain workloads, the reserved CPUs are not always sufficient for dealing with device interrupts, and for this reason, device interrupts are not globally disabled on the isolated CPUs. By default, Node Tuning Operator does not disable device interrupts on isolated CPUs.

To achieve low latency for workloads, some (but not all) pods require the CPUs they are running on to not process device interrupts. A pod annotation, `irq-load-balancing.crio.io`, is used to define whether device interrupts are processed or not. When configured, CRI-O disables device interrupts only as long as the pod is running.

[id="disabling-cpu-cfs-quota_{context}"]
== Disabling CPU CFS quota

To reduce CPU throttling for individual guaranteed pods, create a pod specification with the annotation `cpu-quota.crio.io: "disable"`. This annotation disables the CPU completely fair scheduler (CFS) quota at the pod run time. The following pod specification contains this annotation:

== Disabling global device interrupts handling in Node Tuning Operator

To configure Node Tuning Operator to disable global device interrupts for the isolated CPU set, set the `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` field in the performance profile to `true`. When `true`, conflicting pod annotations are ignored. When `false`, IRQ loads are balanced across all CPUs.

A performance profile snippet illustrates this setting:

To disable interrupt processing for individual pods, ensure that `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` is set to `false` in the performance profile. Then, in the pod specification, set the `irq-load-balancing.crio.io` pod annotation to `disable`. The following pod specification contains this annotation:

When you upgrade the Node Tuning Operator performance profile custom resource definition (CRD) from v1 or v1alpha1 to v2, `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` is set to `true` on existing profiles.

[NOTE]
====
`globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` toggles whether IRQ load balancing will be disabled for the Isolated CPU set. When the option is set to `true` it disables IRQ load balancing for the Isolated CPU set. Setting the option to `false` allows the IRQs to be balanced across all CPUs.

[id="cnf-tuning-nodes-for-low-latency-via-performanceprofile_{context}"]
= Tuning nodes for low latency with the performance profile

The performance profile lets you control latency tuning aspects of nodes that belong to a certain machine config pool. After you specify your settings, the `PerformanceProfile` object is compiled into multiple objects that perform the actual node level tuning:

* A `MachineConfig` file that manipulates the nodes.
* A `KubeletConfig` file that configures the Topology Manager, the CPU Manager, and the {product-title} nodes.
* The Tuned profile that configures the Node Tuning Operator.

You can use a performance profile to specify whether to update the kernel to kernel-rt, to allocate huge pages, and to partition the CPUs for performing housekeeping duties or running workloads.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {product-title} {product-version}, if you apply a performance profile to your cluster, all nodes in the cluster will reboot. This reboot includes control plane nodes and worker nodes that were not targeted by the performance profile. This is a known issue in {product-title} {product-version} because this release uses Linux control group version 2 (cgroup v2) in alignment with RHEL 9. The low latency tuning features associated with the performance profile do not support cgroup v2, therefore the nodes reboot to switch back to the cgroup v1 configuration.

To revert all nodes in the cluster to the cgroups v2 configuration, you must edit the `Node` resource. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-16976[*OCPBUGS-16976*])
====

[NOTE]

You can manually create the `PerformanceProfile` object or use the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) to generate a performance profile. See the additional resources below for more information on the PPC.

[id="cnf-configuring-huge-pages_{context}"]
= Configuring huge pages

Nodes must pre-allocate huge pages used in an {product-title} cluster. Use the Node Tuning Operator to allocate huge pages on a specific node.

{product-title} provides a method for creating and allocating huge pages. Node Tuning Operator provides an easier method for doing  this using the performance profile.

For example, in the `hugepages` `pages` section of the performance profile, you can specify multiple blocks of `size`, `count`, and, optionally, `node`:

[source,yaml]
----
hugepages:
   defaultHugepagesSize: "1G"
   pages:
   - size:  "1G"
     count:  4
     node:  0 <1>
----

<1> `node` is the NUMA node in which the huge pages are allocated. If you omit `node`, the pages are evenly spread across all NUMA nodes.

[NOTE]
====
Wait for the relevant machine config pool status that indicates the update is finished.
====

These are the only configuration steps you need to do to allocate huge pages.


.Verification

= Configuring a node for IRQ dynamic load balancing

Configure a cluster node for IRQ dynamic load balancing to control which cores can receive device interrupt requests (IRQ).

.Prerequisites

* For core isolation, all server hardware components must support IRQ affinity. To check if the hardware components of your server support IRQ affinity, view the server's hardware specifications or contact your hardware provider.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
. Set the performance profile `apiVersion` to use `performance.openshift.io/v2`.
. Remove the `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` field or set it to `false`.
. Set the appropriate isolated and reserved CPUs. The following snippet illustrates a profile that reserves 2 CPUs. IRQ load-balancing is enabled for pods running on the `isolated` CPU set:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2

When you configure reserved and isolated CPUs, the infra containers in pods use the reserved CPUs and the application containers use the isolated CPUs.
====

. Create the pod that uses exclusive CPUs, and set `irq-load-balancing.crio.io` and `cpu-quota.crio.io` annotations to `disable`. For example:

[id="about_irq_affinity_setting_{context}"]
= About support of IRQ affinity setting

Some IRQ controllers lack support for IRQ affinity setting and will always expose all online CPUs as the IRQ mask. These IRQ controllers effectively run on CPU 0.

The following are examples of drivers and hardware that Red Hat are aware lack support for IRQ affinity setting. The list is, by no means, exhaustive:

* Some RAID controller drivers, such as `megaraid_sas`
* Many non-volatile memory express (NVMe) drivers
* Some LAN on motherboard (LOM) network controllers
* The driver uses `managed_irqs`

[NOTE]
====
The reason they do not support IRQ affinity setting might be associated with factors such as the type of processor, the IRQ controller, or the circuitry connections in the motherboard.
====

If the effective affinity of any IRQ is set to an isolated CPU, it might be a sign of some hardware or driver not supporting IRQ affinity setting. To find the effective affinity, log in to the host and run the following command:

[source,terminal]

. Add the `highPowerConsumption` and `realTime` workload hints. Both are set to `true` here.

[id="cnf-cpu-infra-container_{context}"]
= Restricting CPUs for infra and application containers

Generic housekeeping and workload tasks use CPUs in a way that may impact latency-sensitive processes. By default, the container runtime uses all online CPUs to run all containers together, which can result in context switches and spikes in latency. Partitioning the CPUs prevents noisy processes from interfering with latency-sensitive processes by separating them from each other. The following table describes how processes run on a CPU after you have tuned the node using the Node Tuning Operator:

.Process' CPU assignments
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Process type
|Details

|`Burstable` and `BestEffort` pods
|Runs on any CPU except where low latency workload is running

|Infrastructure pods
|Runs on any CPU except where low latency workload is running

|Interrupts
|Redirects to reserved CPUs (optional in {product-title} 4.7 and later)

|Kernel processes
|Pins to reserved CPUs

|Latency-sensitive workload pods
|Pins to a specific set of exclusive CPUs from the isolated pool

|OS processes/systemd services
|Pins to reserved CPUs
|===

The allocatable capacity of cores on a node for pods of all QoS process types, `Burstable`,  `BestEffort`, or `Guaranteed`, is equal to the capacity of the isolated pool. The capacity of the reserved pool is removed from the node's total core capacity for use by the cluster and operating system housekeeping duties.

.Example 1
A node features a capacity of 100 cores. Using a performance profile, the cluster administrator allocates 50 cores to the isolated pool and 50 cores to the reserved pool. The cluster administrator assigns 25 cores to QoS `Guaranteed` pods and 25 cores for `BestEffort` or `Burstable` pods. This matches the capacity of the isolated pool.

.Example 2
A node features a capacity of 100 cores. Using a performance profile, the cluster administrator allocates 50 cores to the isolated pool and 50 cores to the reserved pool. The cluster administrator assigns 50 cores to QoS `Guaranteed` pods and one core for `BestEffort` or `Burstable` pods. This exceeds the capacity of the isolated pool by one core. Pod scheduling fails because of insufficient CPU capacity.


The exact partitioning pattern to use depends on many factors like hardware, workload characteristics and the expected system load. Some sample use cases are as follows:

* If the latency-sensitive workload uses specific hardware, such as a network interface controller (NIC), ensure that the CPUs in the isolated pool are as close as possible to this hardware. At a minimum, you should place the workload in the same Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) node.

* The reserved pool is used for handling all interrupts. When depending on system networking, allocate a sufficiently-sized reserve pool to handle all the incoming packet interrupts. In {product-version} and later versions, workloads can optionally be labeled as sensitive.

The decision regarding which specific CPUs should be used for reserved and isolated partitions requires detailed analysis and measurements. Factors like NUMA affinity of devices and memory play a role. The selection also depends on the workload architecture and the specific use case.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The reserved and isolated CPU pools must not overlap and together must span all available cores in the worker node.
====

To ensure that housekeeping tasks and workloads do not interfere with each other, specify two groups of CPUs in the `spec` section of the performance profile.

* `isolated` - Specifies the CPUs for the application container workloads. These CPUs have the lowest latency. Processes in this group have no interruptions and can, for example, reach much higher DPDK zero packet loss bandwidth.

* `reserved` - Specifies the CPUs for the cluster and operating system housekeeping duties. Threads in the `reserved` group are often busy. Do not run latency-sensitive applications in the `reserved` group. Latency-sensitive applications run in the `isolated` group.

.Procedure

. Create a performance profile appropriate for the environment's hardware and topology.

. Add the `reserved` and `isolated` parameters with the CPUs you want reserved and isolated for the infra and application containers:

[id="reducing-nic-queues-using-the-node-tuning-operator_{context}"]
= Reducing NIC queues using the Node Tuning Operator

The Node Tuning Operator allows you to adjust the network interface controller (NIC) queue count for each network device by configuring the performance profile. Device network queues allows the distribution of packets among different physical queues and each queue gets a separate thread for packet processing.

In real-time or low latency systems, all the unnecessary interrupt request lines (IRQs) pinned to the isolated CPUs must be moved to reserved or housekeeping CPUs.

In deployments with applications that require system, {product-title} networking or in mixed deployments with Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) workloads, multiple queues are needed to achieve good throughput and the number of NIC queues should be adjusted or remain unchanged. For example, to achieve low latency the number of NIC queues for DPDK based workloads should be reduced to just the number of reserved or housekeeping CPUs.

Too many queues are created by default for each CPU and these do not fit into the interrupt tables for housekeeping CPUs when tuning for low latency. Reducing the number of queues makes proper tuning possible. Smaller number of queues means a smaller number of interrupts that then fit in the IRQ table.

[NOTE]
====
In earlier versions of {product-title}, the Performance Addon Operator provided automatic, low latency performance tuning for applications. In {product-title} 4.11 and later, this functionality is part of the Node Tuning Operator.

[id="adjusting-nic-queues-with-the-performance-profile_{context}"]
= Adjusting the NIC queues with the performance profile

The performance profile lets you adjust the queue count for each network device.

Supported network devices:

* Non-virtual network devices

* Network devices that support multiple queues (channels)

Unsupported network devices:

* Pure software network interfaces

* Block devices

* Intel DPDK virtual functions

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} cluster running the Node Tuning Operator as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

. Create and apply a performance profile appropriate for your hardware and topology. For guidance on creating a profile, see the "Creating a performance profile" section.

. Edit this created performance profile:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit -f <your_profile_name>.yaml
----

. Populate the `spec` field with the `net` object. The object list can contain two fields:

* `userLevelNetworking` is a required field specified as a boolean flag. If `userLevelNetworking` is `true`, the queue count is set to the reserved CPU count for all supported devices. The default is `false`.
* `devices` is an optional field specifying a list of devices that will have the queues set to the reserved CPU count. If the device list is empty, the configuration applies to all network devices. The configuration is as follows:
** `interfaceName`: This field specifies the interface name, and it supports shell-style wildcards, which can be positive or negative.
*** Example wildcard syntax is as follows: `<string> .*`
*** Negative rules are prefixed with an exclamation mark. To apply the net queue changes to all devices other than the excluded list, use  `!<device>`, for example, `!eno1`.
** `vendorID`: The network device vendor ID represented as a 16-bit hexadecimal number with a `0x` prefix.
** `deviceID`: The network device ID (model) represented as a 16-bit hexadecimal number with a `0x` prefix.
+
[NOTE]
====
When a `deviceID` is specified, the `vendorID` must also be defined. A device that matches all of the device identifiers specified in a device entry `interfaceName`, `vendorID`, or a pair of `vendorID` plus `deviceID` qualifies as a network device. This network device then has its net queues count set to the reserved CPU count.

When two or more devices are specified, the net queues count is set to any net device that matches one of them.

For example, if there is another network device `ens2` with `vendorID=0x1af4` it will also have total net queues of 2. This matches what is configured in the performance profile.

.Example 3

In this example, the net queue count is set to the reserved CPU count (2) for _all_ supported network devices that match any of the defined device identifiers.

The command `udevadm info` provides a detailed report on a device. In this example the devices are:

= Debugging low latency CNF tuning status

The `PerformanceProfile` custom resource (CR) contains status fields for reporting tuning status and debugging latency degradation issues. These fields report on conditions that describe the state of the operator's reconciliation functionality.

A typical issue can arise when the status of machine config pools that are attached to the performance profile are in a degraded state, causing the `PerformanceProfile` status to degrade. In this case, the machine config pool issues a failure message.

The Node Tuning Operator contains the `performanceProfile.spec.status.Conditions` status field:

== Machine config pools

A performance profile and its created products are applied to a node according to an associated machine config pool (MCP). The MCP holds valuable information about the progress of applying the machine configurations created by performance profiles that encompass kernel args, kube config, huge pages allocation, and deployment of rt-kernel. The Performance Profile controller monitors changes in the MCP and updates the performance profile status accordingly.

The only conditions returned by the MCP to the performance profile status is when the MCP is `Degraded`, which leads to `performanceProfile.status.condition.Degraded = true`.

= Collecting low latency tuning debugging data for Red Hat Support

When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging information about your cluster to Red Hat Support.

The `must-gather` tool enables you to collect diagnostic information about your {product-title} cluster, including node tuning, NUMA topology, and other information needed to debug issues with low latency setup.

For prompt support, supply diagnostic information for both {product-title} and low latency tuning.

[id="cnf-about-must-gather_{context}"]
== About the must-gather tool

The `oc adm must-gather` CLI command collects the information from your cluster that is most likely needed for debugging issues, such as:

* Resource definitions
* Audit logs
* Service logs

You can specify one or more images when you run the command by including the `--image` argument. When you specify an image, the tool collects data related to that feature or product. When you run `oc adm must-gather`, a new pod is created on the cluster. The data is collected on that pod and saved in a new directory that starts with `must-gather.local`. This directory is created in your current working directory.

[id="cnf-about-collecting-low-latency-data_{context}"]
== Gathering low latency tuning data

Use the `oc adm must-gather` CLI command to collect information about your cluster, including features and objects associated with low latency tuning, including:

* The Node Tuning Operator namespaces and child objects.
* `MachineConfigPool` and associated `MachineConfig` objects.
* The Node Tuning Operator and associated Tuned objects.
* Linux kernel command line options.
* CPU and NUMA topology
* Basic PCI device information and NUMA locality.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* The {product-title} CLI (oc) installed.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.

. Collect debugging information by running the following command:

toc::[]

You can use the Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) tests image to run latency tests on a CNF-enabled {product-title} cluster, where all the components required for running CNF workloads are installed. Run the latency tests to validate node tuning for your workload.

The `cnf-tests` container image is available at `registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel8:v{product-version}`.

[id="cnf-latency-tests-prerequisites_{context}"]
== Prerequisites for running latency tests

Your cluster must meet the following requirements before you can run the latency tests:

. You have configured a performance profile with the Node Tuning Operator.

. You have applied all the required CNF configurations in the cluster.

. You have a pre-existing `MachineConfigPool` CR applied in the cluster. The default worker pool is `worker-cnf`.

[role="_additional-resources"]
.Additional resources

* For more information about creating the cluster performance profile, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.adoc#node-tuning-operator-provisioning-worker-with-real-time-capabilities_cnf-master[Provisioning a worker with real-time capabilities].

[id="cnf-measuring-latency_{context}"]
= Measuring latency

The `cnf-tests` image uses three tools to measure the latency of the system:

* `hwlatdetect`
* `cyclictest`
* `oslat`

Each tool has a specific use. Use the tools in sequence to achieve reliable test results.

hwlatdetect:: Measures the baseline that the bare-metal hardware can achieve. Before proceeding with the next latency test, ensure that the latency reported by `hwlatdetect` meets the required threshold because you cannot fix hardware latency spikes by operating system tuning.

cyclictest:: Verifies the real-time kernel scheduler latency after `hwlatdetect` passes validation. The `cyclictest` tool schedules a repeated timer and measures the difference between the desired and the actual trigger times. The difference can uncover basic issues with the tuning caused by interrupts or process priorities. The tool must run on a real-time kernel.

oslat:: Behaves similarly to a CPU-intensive DPDK application and measures all the interruptions and disruptions to the busy loop that simulates CPU heavy data processing.

The tests introduce the following environment variables:

.Latency test environment variables
[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|====
|Environment variables
|Description

|`LATENCY_TEST_DELAY`
|Specifies the amount of time in seconds after which the test starts running. You can use the variable to allow the CPU manager reconcile loop to update the default CPU pool. The default value is 0.

|`LATENCY_TEST_CPUS`
|Specifies the number of CPUs that the pod running the latency tests uses. If you do not set the variable, the default configuration includes all isolated CPUs.

|`LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME`
|Specifies the amount of time in seconds that the latency test must run. The default value is 300 seconds.

|`HWLATDETECT_MAXIMUM_LATENCY`
|Specifies the maximum acceptable hardware latency in microseconds for the workload and operating system. If you do not set the value of `HWLATDETECT_MAXIMUM_LATENCY` or `MAXIMUM_LATENCY`, the tool compares the default expected threshold (20μs) and the actual maximum latency in the tool itself. Then, the test fails or succeeds accordingly.

|`CYCLICTEST_MAXIMUM_LATENCY`
|Specifies the maximum latency in microseconds that all threads expect before waking up during the `cyclictest` run. If you do not set the value of `CYCLICTEST_MAXIMUM_LATENCY` or `MAXIMUM_LATENCY`, the tool skips the comparison of the expected and the actual maximum latency.

|`OSLAT_MAXIMUM_LATENCY`
|Specifies the maximum acceptable latency in microseconds for the `oslat` test results. If you do not set the value of `OSLAT_MAXIMUM_LATENCY` or `MAXIMUM_LATENCY`, the tool skips the comparison of the expected and the actual maximum latency.

|`MAXIMUM_LATENCY`
|Unified variable that specifies the maximum acceptable latency in microseconds. Applicable for all available latency tools.
|====

[NOTE]
====
Variables that are specific to a latency tool take precedence over unified variables. For example, if `OSLAT_MAXIMUM_LATENCY` is set to 30 microseconds and `MAXIMUM_LATENCY` is set to 10 microseconds, the `oslat` test will run with maximum acceptable latency of 30 microseconds.

[id="cnf-performing-end-to-end-tests-running-the-tests_{context}"]
= Running the latency tests

Run the cluster latency tests to validate node tuning for your Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) workload.

[NOTE]
====
When executing `podman` commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with `permission denied` errors. To make the `podman` command work, append `:Z` to the volumes creation; for example, `-v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z`. This allows `podman` to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
====

.Procedure

. Open a shell prompt in the directory containing the `kubeconfig` file.
+
You provide the test image with a `kubeconfig` file in current directory and its related `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable, mounted through a volume. This allows the running container to use the `kubeconfig` file from inside the container.

. Run the latency tests by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=<time_in_seconds>\
-e MAXIMUM_LATENCY=<time_in_microseconds> \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel8:v{product-version} /usr/bin/test-run.sh \
--ginkgo.v
----

. Optional: Append `--ginkgo.dryRun` flag to run the latency tests in dry-run mode. This is useful for checking what commands the tests run.

. Optional: Append `--ginkgo.v` flag to run the tests with increased verbosity.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The default runtime for each test is 300 seconds.
For valid latency test results, run the tests for at least 12 hours by updating the `LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME` variable.
====

= Running hwlatdetect

The `hwlatdetect` tool is available in the `rt-kernel` package with a regular subscription of {op-system-base-full} {op-system-version}.

[NOTE]
====
When executing `podman` commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with `permission denied` errors. To make the `podman` command work, append `:Z` to the volumes creation; for example, `-v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z`. This allows `podman` to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the real-time kernel in the cluster.

* You have logged in to `registry.redhat.io` with your Customer Portal credentials.

.Procedure

* To run the `hwlatdetect` tests, run the following command, substituting variable values as appropriate:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \

/usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.focus="hwlatdetect" --ginkgo.v
----
+
The `hwlatdetect` test runs for 10 minutes (600 seconds). The test runs successfully when the maximum observed latency is lower than `MAXIMUM_LATENCY` (20 μs).
+
If the results exceed the latency threshold, the test fails.
+

The output of `hwlatdetect` shows that multiple samples exceed the threshold. However, the same output can indicate different results based on the following factors:

* The duration of the test
* The number of CPU cores
* The host firmware settings

[WARNING]
====
Before proceeding with the next latency test, ensure that the latency reported by `hwlatdetect` meets the required threshold. Fixing latencies introduced by hardware might require you to contact the system vendor support.

Not all latency spikes are hardware related. Ensure that you tune the host firmware to meet your workload requirements. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_for_real_time/9/html-single/optimizing_rhel_9_for_real_time_for_low_latency_operation/index#setting-bios-parameters-for-system-tuning_optimizing-RHEL9-for-real-time-for-low-latency-operation[Setting firmware parameters for system tuning].

[id="cnf-performing-end-to-end-tests-running-cyclictest_{context}"]
= Running cyclictest

The `cyclictest` tool measures the real-time kernel scheduler latency on the specified CPUs.

[NOTE]
====
When executing `podman` commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with `permission denied` errors. To make the `podman` command work, append `:Z` to the volumes creation; for example, `-v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z`. This allows `podman` to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to `registry.redhat.io` with your Customer Portal credentials.

* You have installed the real-time kernel in the cluster.

* You have applied a cluster performance profile by using Node Tuning Operator.

.Procedure

* To perform the `cyclictest`, run the following command, substituting variable values as appropriate:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e LATENCY_TEST_CPUS=10 -e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=600 -e MAXIMUM_LATENCY=20 \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel8:v{product-version} \
/usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.focus="cyclictest" --ginkgo.v
----
+
The command runs the `cyclictest` tool for 10 minutes (600 seconds). The test runs successfully when the maximum observed latency is lower than `MAXIMUM_LATENCY` (in this example, 20 μs). Latency spikes of 20 μs and above are generally not acceptable for {rds} workloads.
+
If the results exceed the latency threshold, the test fails.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For valid results, the test should run for at least 12 hours.

When executing `podman` commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with `permission denied` errors. To make the `podman` command work, append `:Z` to the volumes creation; for example, `-v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z`. This allows `podman` to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have applied a cluster performance profile by using the Node Tuning Operator.

.Procedure

* To run the latency tests on a {sno} cluster, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=<time_in_seconds> registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel8:v{product-version} \
/usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.v
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The default runtime for each test is 300 seconds.
For valid latency test results, run the tests for at least 12 hours by updating the `LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME` variable.
To run the buckets latency validation step, you must specify a maximum latency. For details on maximum latency variables, see the table in the "Measuring latency" section.
====

= Running latency tests in a disconnected cluster

The CNF tests image can run tests in a disconnected cluster that is not able to reach external registries. This requires two steps:

. Mirroring the `cnf-tests` image to the custom disconnected registry.

. Instructing the tests to consume the images from the custom disconnected registry.

== Mirroring images to the cluster {product-registry}

{product-title} provides a built-in container image registry, which runs as a standard workload on the cluster.

.Procedure

. Gain external access to the registry by exposing it with a route:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}' --type=merge
----

. Fetch the registry endpoint by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ REGISTRY=$(oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry --template='{{ .spec.host }}')
----

. Create a namespace for exposing the images:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create ns cnftests
----

. Make the image stream available to all the namespaces used for tests. This is required to allow the tests namespaces to fetch the images from the `cnf-tests` image stream. Run the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:cnf-features-testing:default --namespace=cnftests
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:performance-addon-operators-testing:default --namespace=cnftests
----

. Retrieve the docker secret name and auth token by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ SECRET=$(oc -n cnftests get secret | grep builder-docker | awk {'print $1'}
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ TOKEN=$(oc -n cnftests get secret $SECRET -o jsonpath="{.data['\.dockercfg']}" | base64 --decode | jq '.["image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000"].auth')
----

. Create a `dockerauth.json` file, for example:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ echo "{\"auths\": { \"$REGISTRY\": { \"auth\": $TOKEN } }}" > dockerauth.json
----

. Do the image mirroring:

[discrete]
[id="mirroring-different-set-of-images_{context}"]
== Mirroring a different set of test images

You can optionally change the default upstream images that are mirrored for the latency tests.

.Procedure

. The `mirror` command tries to mirror the upstream images by default. This can be overridden by passing a file with the following format to the image:
+

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
[
    {
        "registry": "public.registry.io:5000",
        "image": "imageforcnftests:{product-version}"
    }
]
----

. Pass the file to the `mirror` command, for example saving it locally as `images.json`. With the following command, the local path is mounted in `/kubeconfig` inside the container and that can be passed to the mirror command.
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]

If the cluster administrator has performed latency tests for platform verification, they can discover the need to adjust the operation of the cluster to ensure stability in cases of high latency. The cluster administrator need change only one parameter, recorded in a file, which controls four parameters affecting how supervisory processes read status and interpret the health of the cluster. Changing only the one parameter provides cluster tuning in an easy, supportable manner.

The `Kubelet` process provides the starting point for monitoring cluster health. The `Kubelet` sets status values for all nodes in the {product-title} cluster. The Kubernetes Controller Manager (`kube controller`) reads the status values every 10 seconds, by default.
If the `kube controller` cannot read a node status value, it loses contact with that node after a configured period. The default behavior is:

. The node controller on the control plane updates the node health to `Unhealthy` and marks the node `Ready` condition`Unknown`.

. In response, the scheduler stops scheduling pods to that node.

. The Node Lifecycle Controller adds a `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` taint with a `NoExecute` effect to the node and schedules any pods on the node for eviction after five minutes, by default.

This behavior can cause problems if your network is prone to latency issues, especially if you have nodes at the network edge. In some cases, the Kubernetes Controller Manager might not receive an update from a healthy node due to network latency. The `Kubelet` evicts pods from the node even though the node is healthy.

To avoid this problem, you can use _worker latency profiles_ to adjust the frequency that the `Kubelet` and the Kubernetes Controller Manager wait for status updates before taking action. These adjustments help to ensure that your cluster runs properly if network latency between the control plane and the worker nodes is not optimal.

These worker latency profiles contain three sets of parameters that are pre-defined with carefully tuned values to control the reaction of the cluster to increased latency. No need to experimentally find the best values manually.

You can configure worker latency profiles when installing a cluster or at any time you notice increased latency in your cluster network.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="nodes-cluster-worker-latency-profiles-about_{context}"]
= Understanding worker latency profiles

Worker latency profiles are four different categories of carefully-tuned parameters. The four parameters which implement these values are `node-status-update-frequency`, `node-monitor-grace-period`, `default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds`. These parameters can use values which allow you control the reaction of the cluster to latency issues without needing to determine the best values using manual methods.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Setting these parameters manually is not supported. Incorrect parameter settings adversely affect cluster stability.
====

All worker latency profiles configure the following parameters:

--
node-status-update-frequency:: Specifies how often the kubelet posts node status to the API server.
node-monitor-grace-period::  Specifies the amount of time in seconds that the Kubernetes Controller Manager waits for an update from a kubelet before marking the node unhealthy and adding the `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` or `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` taint to the node.
default-not-ready-toleration-seconds:: Specifies the amount of time in seconds after marking a node unhealthy that the Kube API Server Operator waits before evicting pods from that node.
default-unreachable-toleration-seconds:: Specifies the amount of time in seconds after marking a node unreachable that the Kube API Server Operator waits before evicting pods from that node.
--

The following Operators monitor the changes to the worker latency profiles and respond accordingly:

* The Machine Config Operator (MCO) updates the `node-status-update-frequency` parameter on the worker nodes.
* The Kubernetes Controller Manager updates the `node-monitor-grace-period` parameter on the control plane nodes.
* The Kubernetes API Server Operator updates the `default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds` parameters on the control plane nodes.

Although the default configuration works in most cases, {product-title} offers two other worker latency profiles for situations where the network is experiencing higher latency than usual. The three worker latency profiles are described in the following sections:

Default worker latency profile:: With the `Default` profile, each `Kubelet` updates it's status every 10 seconds (`node-status-update-frequency`). The `Kube Controller Manager` checks the statuses of `Kubelet` every 5 seconds (`node-monitor-grace-period`).
+
The Kubernetes Controller Manager waits 40 seconds for a status update from `Kubelet` before considering the `Kubelet` unhealthy. If no status is made available to the Kubernetes Controller Manager, it then marks the node with the `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` or `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` taint and evicts the pods on that node.
+
If a pod on that node has the `NoExecute` taint, the pod is run according to `tolerationSeconds`. If the pod has no taint, it will be evicted in 300 seconds (`default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds` settings of the `Kube API Server`).

Medium worker latency profile:: Use the `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` profile if the network latency is slightly higher than usual.
+
The `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` profile reduces the frequency of kubelet updates to 20 seconds and changes the period that the Kubernetes Controller Manager waits for those updates to 2 minutes. The pod eviction period for a pod on that node is reduced to 60 seconds. If the pod has the `tolerationSeconds` parameter, the eviction waits for the period specified by that parameter.
+
The Kubernetes Controller Manager waits for 2 minutes to consider a node unhealthy. In another minute, the eviction process starts.

====
To edit the configuration of the installer, you will first need to use the command `openshift-install create manifests` to create the default node manifest as well as other manifest YAML files. This file structure must exist before we can add workerLatencyProfile. The platform on which you are installing may have varying requirements. Refer to the Installing section of the documentation for your specific platform.
====

The `workerLatencyProfile` must be added to the manifest in the following sequence:

. Create the manifest needed to build the cluster, using a folder name appropriate for your installation.
. Create a YAML file to define `config.node`. The file must be in the `manifests` directory.
. When defining `workerLatencyProfile` in the manifest for the first time, specify any of the profiles at cluster creation time: `Default`, `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` or `LowUpdateSlowReaction`.

.Verification
* Here is an example manifest creation showing the `spec.workerLatencyProfile` `Default` value in the manifest file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir=<cluster-install-dir>

= Using and changing worker latency profiles

To change a worker latency profile to deal with network latency, edit the `node.config` object to add the name of the profile. You can change the profile at any time as latency increases or decreases.

You must move one worker latency profile at a time. For example, you cannot move directly from the `Default` profile to the `LowUpdateSlowReaction` worker latency profile. You must move from the `Default` worker latency profile to the `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` profile first, then to `LowUpdateSlowReaction`. Similarly, when returning to the `Default` profile, you must move from the low profile to the medium profile first, then to `Default`.

[NOTE]
====
You can also configure worker latency profiles upon installing an {product-title} cluster.
====

.Procedure

To move from the default worker latency profile:

. Move to the medium worker latency profile:

.. Edit the `node.config` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit nodes.config/cluster
----

.. Add `spec.workerLatencyProfile: MediumUpdateAverageReaction`:

= Example steps for displaying resulting values of workerLatencyProfile

You can display the values in the `workerLatencyProfile` with the following commands.

.Verification

. Check the `default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds` fields output by the Kube API Server:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get KubeAPIServer -o yaml | grep -A 1 default-
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
default-not-ready-toleration-seconds:
- "300"
default-unreachable-toleration-seconds:
- "300"
----

. Check the values of the `node-monitor-grace-period` field from the Kube Controller Manager:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get KubeControllerManager -o yaml | grep -A 1 node-monitor
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
node-monitor-grace-period:
- 40s
----

. Check the `nodeStatusUpdateFrequency` value from the Kubelet. Set the directory `/host` as the root directory within the debug shell. By changing the root directory to `/host`, you can run binaries contained in the host’s executable paths:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<worker-node-name>
$ chroot /host
# cat /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf|grep nodeStatusUpdateFrequency
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
  “nodeStatusUpdateFrequency”: “10s”
----

These outputs validate the set of timing variables for the Worker Latency Profile.

Learn about the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) and how you can use it to create a performance profile.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, disabling CPU load balancing is not supported by cgroup v2. As a result, you might not get the desired behavior from performance profiles if you have cgroup v2 enabled. Enabling cgroup v2 is not recommended if you are using performance profiles.

= About the Performance Profile Creator

The Performance Profile Creator (PPC) is a command-line tool, delivered with the Node Tuning Operator, used to create the performance profile.
The tool consumes `must-gather` data from the cluster and several user-supplied profile arguments. The PPC generates a performance profile that is appropriate for your hardware and topology.

The tool is run by one of the following methods:

* Invoking `podman`

* Calling a wrapper script

[id="gathering-data-about-your-cluster-using-must-gather_{context}"]
= Gathering data about your cluster using the must-gather command

The Performance Profile Creator (PPC) tool requires `must-gather` data. As a cluster administrator, run the `must-gather` command to capture information about your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed.

.Procedure

. Optional: Verify that a matching machine config pool exists with a label:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe mcp/worker-rt
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Name:         worker-rt
Namespace:
Labels:       machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role=worker-rt
----

. If a matching label does not exist add a label for a machine config pool (MCP) that matches with the MCP name:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label mcp <mcp_name> <mcp_name>=""
----

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.

. Collect cluster information by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather
----

. Optional: Create a compressed file from the `must-gather` directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar cvaf must-gather.tar.gz must-gather/
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Compressed output is required if you are running the Performance Profile Creator wrapper script.

. Run the Performance Profile Creator tool in discovery mode:
+
[NOTE]
====
Discovery mode inspects your cluster using the output from `must-gather`. The output produced includes information on:

* The NUMA cell partitioning with the allocated CPU ids
* Whether hyperthreading is enabled

Using this information you can set appropriate values for some of the arguments supplied to the Performance Profile Creator tool.

$ podman run --entrypoint performance-profile-creator -v <path_to_must-gather>/must-gather:/must-gather:z registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-cluster-node-tuning-operator:v{product-version} --info log --must-gather-dir-path /must-gather
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This command uses the performance profile creator as a new entry point to `podman`. It maps the `must-gather` data for the host into the container image and invokes the required user-supplied profile arguments to produce the `my-performance-profile.yaml` file.

The `-v` option can be the path to either:

* The `must-gather` output directory
* An existing directory containing the `must-gather` decompressed tarball

The `info` option requires a value which specifies the output format. Possible values are log and JSON. The JSON format is reserved for debugging.
====

. Run `podman`:

[NOTE]
====
The Performance Profile Creator arguments are shown in the Performance Profile Creator arguments table. The following arguments are required:

* `reserved-cpu-count`
* `mcp-name`
* `rt-kernel`

The `mcp-name` argument in this example is set to `worker-cnf` based on the output of the command `oc get mcp`. For {sno} use `--mcp-name=master`.

= How to run `podman` to create a performance profile

The following example illustrates how to run `podman` to create a performance profile with 20 reserved CPUs that are to be split across the NUMA nodes.

Node hardware configuration:

* 80 CPUs
* Hyperthreading enabled
* Two NUMA nodes
* Even numbered CPUs run on NUMA node 0 and odd numbered CPUs run on NUMA node 1

Run `podman` to create the performance profile:

[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run --entrypoint performance-profile-creator -v /must-gather:/must-gather:z registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-cluster-node-tuning-operator:v{product-version} --mcp-name=worker-cnf --reserved-cpu-count=20 --rt-kernel=true --split-reserved-cpus-across-numa=true --must-gather-dir-path /must-gather > my-performance-profile.yaml
----

The created profile is described in the following YAML:

[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
  kind: PerformanceProfile
  metadata:
    name: performance
  spec:
    cpu:

[NOTE]
====
In this case, 10 CPUs are reserved on NUMA node 0 and 10 are reserved on NUMA node 1.

toc::[]

In resource-constrained environments, you can use workload partitioning to isolate {product-title} services, cluster management workloads, and infrastructure pods to run on a reserved set of CPUs.

The minimum number of reserved CPUs required for the cluster management is four CPU Hyper-Threads (HTs).
With workload partitioning, you annotate the set of cluster management pods and a set of typical add-on Operators for inclusion in the cluster management workload partition.
These pods operate normally within the minimum size CPU configuration.
Additional Operators or workloads outside of the set of minimum cluster management pods require additional CPUs to be added to the workload partition.

Workload partitioning isolates user workloads from platform workloads using standard Kubernetes scheduling capabilities.

The following changes are required for workload partitioning:

. In the `install-config.yaml` file, add the additional field: `cpuPartitioningMode`.

.PerformanceProfile CR options for {sno} clusters
[cols=2*, width="90%", options="header"]
|====
|PerformanceProfile CR field
|Description

|`metadata.name`
a|Ensure that `name` matches the following fields set in related {ztp} custom resources (CRs):

* `include=openshift-node-performance-${PerformanceProfile.metadata.name}` in `TunedPerformancePatch.yaml`
* `name: 50-performance-${PerformanceProfile.metadata.name}` in `validatorCRs/informDuValidator.yaml`

|`spec.additionalKernelArgs`
|`"efi=runtime"` Configures UEFI secure boot for the cluster host.

|`spec.cpu.isolated`
a|Set the isolated CPUs. Ensure all of the Hyper-Threading pairs match.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The reserved and isolated CPU pools must not overlap and together must span all available cores. CPU cores that are not accounted for cause an undefined behaviour in the system.
====

|`spec.cpu.reserved`
|Set the reserved CPUs. When workload partitioning is enabled, system processes, kernel threads, and system container threads are restricted to these CPUs. All CPUs that are not isolated should be reserved.

|`spec.hugepages.pages`
a|* Set the number of huge pages (`count`)
* Set the huge pages size (`size`).
* Set `node` to the NUMA node where the `hugepages` are allocated (`node`)

|`spec.realTimeKernel`
|Set `enabled` to `true` to use the realtime kernel.

|`spec.workloadHints`
|Use `workloadHints` to define the set of top level flags for different type of workloads.
The example configuration configures the cluster for low latency and high performance.
|====

Workload partitioning introduces an extended `management.workload.openshift.io/cores` resource type for platform pods.
kubelet advertises the resources and CPU requests by pods allocated to the pool within the corresponding resource.
When workload partitioning is enabled, the `management.workload.openshift.io/cores` resource allows the scheduler to correctly assign pods based on the `cpushares` capacity of the host, not just the default `cpuset`.

The Node Observability Operator collects and stores CRI-O and Kubelet profiling or metrics from scripts of compute nodes.

With the Node Observability Operator, you can query the profiling data, enabling analysis of performance trends in CRI-O and Kubelet. It supports debugging performance-related issues and executing embedded scripts for network metrics by using the `run` field in the custom resource definition. To enable CRI-O and Kubelet profiling or scripting, you can configure the `type` field in the custom resource definition.

[id="creating-node-observability-custom-resource_{context}"]
= Creating the Node Observability custom resource

You must create and run the `NodeObservability` custom resource (CR) before you run the profiling query. When you run the `NodeObservability` CR, it creates the necessary machine config and machine config pool CRs to enable the CRI-O profiling on the worker nodes matching the `nodeSelector`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If CRI-O profiling is not enabled on the worker nodes, the `NodeObservabilityMachineConfig` resource gets created. Worker nodes matching the `nodeSelector` specified in `NodeObservability` CR restarts. This might take 10 or more minutes to complete.
====

[NOTE]
====
Kubelet profiling is enabled by default.
====

The CRI-O unix socket of the node is mounted on the agent pod, which allows the agent to communicate with CRI-O to run the pprof request. Similarly, the `kubelet-serving-ca` certificate chain is mounted on the agent pod, which allows secure communication between the agent and node's kubelet endpoint.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the Node Observability Operator.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login -u kubeadmin https://<HOSTNAME>:6443
----

. Switch back to the `node-observability-operator` namespace by running the following command:
+

= Running the profiling query

To run the profiling query, you must create a `NodeObservabilityRun` resource. The profiling query is a blocking operation that fetches CRI-O and Kubelet profiling data for a duration of 30 seconds. After the profiling query is complete, you must retrieve the profiling data inside the container file system `/run/node-observability` directory. The lifetime of data is bound to the agent pod through the `emptyDir` volume, so you can access the profiling data while the agent pod is in the `running` status.

== Node Observability Operator scripting

Scripting allows you to run pre-configured bash scripts, using the current Node Observability Operator and Node Observability Agent.

These scripts monitor key metrics like CPU load, memory pressure, and worker node issues. They also collect sar reports and custom performance metrics.

= Creating the Node Observability custom resource for scripting

You must create and run the `NodeObservability` custom resource (CR) before you run the scripting. When you run the `NodeObservability` CR, it enables the agent in scripting mode on the compute nodes matching the `nodeSelector` label.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the Node Observability Operator.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.
* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} cluster by running the following command:

Edge computing presents complex challenges when managing many sites in geographically displaced locations. Use {ztp-first} to provision and manage sites at the far edge of the network.

[id="ztp-challenges-of-far-edge-deployments_{context}"]
= Overcoming the challenges of the network far edge

Today, service providers want to deploy their infrastructure at the edge of the network. This presents significant challenges:

* How do you handle deployments of many edge sites in parallel?
* What happens when you need to deploy sites in disconnected environments?
* How do you manage the lifecycle of large fleets of clusters?

{ztp-first} and _GitOps_ meets these challenges by allowing you to provision remote edge sites at scale with declarative site definitions and configurations for bare-metal equipment. Template or overlay configurations install {product-title} features that are required for CNF workloads. The full lifecycle of installation and upgrades is handled through the {ztp} pipeline.

{ztp} uses GitOps for infrastructure deployments. With GitOps, you use declarative YAML files and other defined patterns stored in Git repositories. {rh-rhacm-first} uses your Git repositories to drive the deployment of your infrastructure.

GitOps provides traceability, role-based access control (RBAC), and a single source of truth for the desired state of each site. Scalability issues are addressed by Git methodologies and event driven operations through webhooks.

You start the {ztp} workflow by creating declarative site definition and configuration custom resources (CRs) that the {ztp} pipeline delivers to the edge nodes.

The following diagram shows how {ztp} works within the far edge framework.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="about-ztp_{context}"]
= Using {ztp} to provision clusters at the network far edge

{rh-rhacm-first} manages clusters in a hub-and-spoke architecture, where a single hub cluster manages many spoke clusters. Hub clusters running {rh-rhacm} provision and deploy the managed clusters by using {ztp-first} and the assisted service that is deployed when you install {rh-rhacm}.

The assisted service handles provisioning of {product-title} on single node clusters, three-node clusters, or standard clusters running on bare metal.

A high-level overview of using {ztp} to provision and maintain bare-metal hosts with {product-title} is as follows:

* A hub cluster running {rh-rhacm} manages an {product-registry} that mirrors the {product-title} release images. {rh-rhacm} uses the {product-registry} to provision the managed clusters.

* You manage the bare-metal hosts in a YAML format inventory file, versioned in a Git repository.

* You make the hosts ready for provisioning as managed clusters, and use {rh-rhacm} and the assisted service to install the bare-metal hosts on site.

Installing and deploying the clusters is a two-stage process, involving an initial installation phase, and a subsequent configuration and deployment phase. The following diagram illustrates this workflow:

[id="ztp-creating-ztp-crs-for-multiple-managed-clusters_{context}"]
= Installing managed clusters with SiteConfig resources and {rh-rhacm}

{ztp-first} uses `SiteConfig` custom resources (CRs) in a Git repository to manage the processes that install {product-title} clusters. The `SiteConfig` CR contains cluster-specific parameters required for installation. It has options for applying select configuration CRs during installation including user defined extra manifests.

The {ztp} plugin processes `SiteConfig` CRs to generate a collection of CRs on the hub cluster. This triggers the assisted service in {rh-rhacm-first} to install {product-title} on the bare-metal host. You can find installation status and error messages in these CRs on the hub cluster.

You can provision single clusters manually or in batches with {ztp}:

Provisioning a single cluster:: Create a single `SiteConfig` CR and related installation and configuration CRs for the cluster, and apply them in the hub cluster to begin cluster provisioning. This is a good way to test your CRs before deploying on a larger scale.

Provisioning many clusters:: Install managed clusters in batches of up to 400 by defining `SiteConfig` and related CRs in a Git repository. ArgoCD uses the `SiteConfig` CRs to deploy the sites. The {rh-rhacm} policy generator creates the manifests and applies them to the hub cluster. This starts the cluster provisioning process.

[id="ztp-configuring-cluster-policies_{context}"]
= Configuring managed clusters with policies and PolicyGenTemplate resources

{ztp-first} uses {rh-rhacm-first} to configure clusters by using a policy-based governance approach to applying the configuration.

The policy generator or `PolicyGen` is a plugin for the GitOps Operator that enables the creation of {rh-rhacm} policies from a concise template. The tool can combine multiple CRs into a single policy, and you can generate multiple policies that apply to various subsets of clusters in your fleet.

[NOTE]
====
For scalability and to reduce the complexity of managing configurations across the fleet of clusters, use configuration CRs with as much commonality as possible.

* Where possible, apply configuration CRs using a fleet-wide common policy.

* The next preference is to create logical groupings of clusters to manage as much of the remaining configurations as possible under a group policy.

* When a configuration is unique to an individual site, use {rh-rhacm} templating on the hub cluster to inject the site-specific data into a common or group policy. Alternatively, apply an individual site policy for the site.
====

The following diagram shows how the policy generator interacts with GitOps and {rh-rhacm} in the configuration phase of cluster deployment.

image::217_OpenShift_Zero_Touch_Provisioning_updates_1022_3.png[Policy generator]

For large fleets of clusters, it is typical for there to be a high-level of consistency in the configuration of those clusters.

The following recommended structuring of policies combines configuration CRs to meet several goals:

* Describe common configurations once and apply to the fleet.

* Minimize the number of maintained and managed policies.

* Support flexibility in common configurations for cluster variants.

.Recommended PolicyGenTemplate policy categories
[cols="1,5", width="100%", options="header"]
|====
|Policy category
|Description

|Common
|A policy that exists in the common category is applied to all clusters in the fleet. Use common `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs to apply common installation settings across all cluster types.

|Groups
|A policy that exists in the groups category is applied to a group of clusters in the fleet. Use group `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs to manage specific aspects of single-node, three-node, and standard cluster installations. Cluster groups can also follow geographic region, hardware variant, etc.

|Sites
|A policy that exists in the sites category is applied to a specific cluster site. Any cluster
can have its own specific policies maintained.

To use {rh-rhacm} in a disconnected environment, create a mirror registry that mirrors the {product-title} release images and Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) catalog that contains the required Operator images. OLM manages, installs, and upgrades Operators and their dependencies in the cluster. You can also use a disconnected mirror host to serve the {op-system} ISO and RootFS disk images that are used to provision the bare-metal hosts.

[id="ztp-gitops-ztp-max-spoke-clusters_{context}"]
= Recommended hub cluster specifications and managed cluster limits for {ztp}

With {ztp-first}, you can manage thousands of clusters in geographically dispersed regions and networks.
The Red Hat Performance and Scale lab successfully created and managed 3500 virtual {sno} clusters with a reduced DU profile from a single {rh-rhacm-first} hub cluster in a lab environment.

In real-world situations, the scaling limits for the number of clusters that you can manage will vary depending on various factors affecting the hub cluster.
For example:

Hub cluster resources::
Available hub cluster host resources (CPU, memory, storage) are an important factor in determining how many clusters the hub cluster can manage.
The more resources allocated to the hub cluster, the more managed clusters it can accommodate.

Hub cluster storage::
The hub cluster host storage IOPS rating and whether the hub cluster hosts use NVMe storage can affect hub cluster performance and the number of clusters it can manage.

Network bandwidth and latency::
Slow or high-latency network connections between the hub cluster and managed clusters can impact how the hub cluster manages multiple clusters.

Managed cluster size and complexity::
The size and complexity of the managed clusters also affects the capacity of the hub cluster.
Larger managed clusters with more nodes, namespaces, and resources require additional processing and management resources.
Similarly, clusters with complex configurations such as the RAN DU profile or diverse workloads can require more resources from the hub cluster.

Number of managed policies::
The number of policies managed by the hub cluster scaled over the number of managed clusters bound to those policies is an important factor that determines how many clusters can be managed.

Monitoring and management workloads::
{rh-rhacm} continuously monitors and manages the managed clusters.
The number and complexity of monitoring and management workloads running on the hub cluster can affect its capacity.
Intensive monitoring or frequent reconciliation operations can require additional resources, potentially limiting the number of manageable clusters.

{rh-rhacm} version and configuration::
Different versions of {rh-rhacm} can have varying performance characteristics and resource requirements.
Additionally, the configuration settings of {rh-rhacm}, such as the number of concurrent reconciliations or the frequency of health checks, can affect the managed cluster capacity of the hub cluster.

Use the following representative configuration and network specifications to develop your own Hub cluster and network specifications.

= Installing {ztp} in a disconnected environment

Use {rh-rhacm-first}, {gitops-title}, and {cgu-operator-first} on the hub cluster in the disconnected environment to manage the deployment of multiple managed clusters.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {product-title} CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have configured a disconnected mirror registry for use in the cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The disconnected mirror registry that you create must contain a version of {cgu-operator} backup and pre-cache images that matches the version of {cgu-operator} running in the hub cluster. The spoke cluster must be able to resolve these images in the disconnected mirror registry.
====

.Procedure

* Install {rh-rhacm} in the hub cluster. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/{rh-rhacm-version}/html/install/installing#install-on-disconnected-networks[Installing {rh-rhacm} in a disconnected environment].

[id="ztp-acm-adding-images-to-mirror-registry_{context}"]
= Adding {op-system} ISO and RootFS images to the disconnected mirror host

Before you begin installing clusters in the disconnected environment with {rh-rhacm-first}, you must first host {op-system-first} images for it to use. Use a disconnected mirror to host the {op-system} images.

.Prerequisites

* Deploy and configure an HTTP server to host the {op-system} image resources on the network. You must be able to access the HTTP server from your computer, and from the machines that you create.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {op-system} images might not change with every release of {product-title}. You must download images with the highest version that is less than or equal to the version that you install. Use the image versions that match your {product-title} version if they are available. You require ISO and RootFS images to install {op-system} on the hosts. {op-system} QCOW2 images are not supported for this installation type.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the mirror host.
. Obtain the {op-system} ISO and RootFS images from link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/[mirror.openshift.com], for example:

.. Export the required image names and {product-title} version as environment variables:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export ISO_IMAGE_NAME=<iso_image_name> <1>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export ROOTFS_IMAGE_NAME=<rootfs_image_name> <2>

= Enabling the assisted service

{rh-rhacm-first} uses the assisted service to deploy {product-title} clusters. The assisted service is deployed automatically when you enable the MultiClusterHub Operator on {rh-rhacm-first}. After that, you need to configure the `Provisioning` resource to watch all namespaces and to update the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource (CR) with references to the ISO and RootFS images that are hosted on the mirror registry HTTP server.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have {rh-rhacm} with MultiClusterHub enabled.

.Procedure

. Enable the `Provisioning` resource to watch all namespaces and configure mirrors for disconnected environments. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.9/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#enable-cim[Enabling the central infrastructure management service].

. Update the `AgentServiceConfig` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit AgentServiceConfig
----

. Add the following entry to the `items.spec.osImages` field in the CR:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
- cpuArchitecture: x86_64
    openshiftVersion: "{product-version}"

[id="ztp-configuring-the-cluster-for-a-disconnected-environment_{context}"]
= Configuring the hub cluster to use a disconnected mirror registry

You can configure the hub cluster to use a disconnected mirror registry for a disconnected environment.

.Prerequisites

* You have a disconnected hub cluster installation with {rh-rhacm-first} {rh-rhacm-version} installed.

* You have hosted the `rootfs` and `iso` images on an HTTP server.

[WARNING]
====
If you enable TLS for the HTTP server, you must confirm the root certificate is signed by an authority trusted by the client and verify the trusted certificate chain between your {product-title} hub and managed clusters and the HTTP server. Using a server configured with an untrusted certificate prevents the images from being downloaded to the image creation service. Using untrusted HTTPS servers is not supported.
====

.Procedure

. Create a `ConfigMap` containing the mirror registry config:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1

----
<1> The `ConfigMap` namespace must be the same as the namespace of the Infrastructure Operator.
<2> The mirror registry’s certificate that is used when creating the mirror registry.
<3> The configuration file for the mirror registry. The mirror registry configuration adds mirror information to the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file in the discovery image. The mirror information is stored in the `imageContentSources` section of the `install-config.yaml` file when the information is passed to the installation program. The Assisted Service pod that runs on the hub cluster fetches the container images from the configured mirror registry.
<4> The URL of the mirror registry. You must use the URL from the `imageContentSources` section by running the `oc adm release mirror` command when you configure the mirror registry. For more information, see the _Mirroring the OpenShift Container Platform image repository_ section.
<5> The registries defined in the `registries.conf` file must be scoped by repository, not by registry. In this example, both the `quay.io/example-repository` and the `mirror1.registry.corp.com:5000/example-repository` repositories are scoped by the `example-repository` repository.
+
This updates `mirrorRegistryRef` in the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource, as shown below:

[id="ztp-configuring-hub-cluster-with-argocd_{context}"]
= Configuring the hub cluster with ArgoCD

You can configure the hub cluster with a set of ArgoCD applications that generate the required installation and policy custom resources (CRs) for each site with {ztp-first}.

[NOTE]
====
{rh-rhacm-first} uses `SiteConfig` CRs to generate the Day 1 managed cluster installation CRs for ArgoCD. Each ArgoCD application can manage a maximum of 300 `SiteConfig` CRs.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have a {product-title} hub cluster with {rh-rhacm-first} and {gitops-title} installed.

* You have extracted the reference deployment from the {ztp} plugin container as described in the "Preparing the {ztp} site configuration repository" section. Extracting the reference deployment creates the `out/argocd/deployment` directory referenced in the following procedure.

.Procedure

. Prepare the ArgoCD pipeline configuration:

.. Create a Git repository with the directory structure similar to the example directory. For more information, see "Preparing the {ztp} site configuration repository".

.. Configure access to the repository using the ArgoCD UI. Under *Settings* configure the following:

*** *Repositories* - Add the connection information. The URL must end in `.git`, for example, `https://repo.example.com/repo.git` and credentials.

*** *Certificates* - Add the public certificate for the repository, if needed.

.. Modify the two ArgoCD applications, `out/argocd/deployment/clusters-app.yaml` and `out/argocd/deployment/policies-app.yaml`, based on your Git repository:

*** Update the URL to point to the Git repository. The URL ends with `.git`, for example, `https://repo.example.com/repo.git`.

*** The `targetRevision` indicates which Git repository branch to monitor.

*** `path` specifies the path to the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs, respectively.

. To install the {ztp} plugin you must patch the ArgoCD instance in the hub cluster by using the patch file previously extracted into the `out/argocd/deployment/` directory. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch argocd openshift-gitops \
-n openshift-gitops --type=merge \
--patch-file out/argocd/deployment/argocd-openshift-gitops-patch.json
----

. In {rh-rhacm} 2.7 and later, the multicluster engine enables the `cluster-proxy-addon` feature by default.
To disable this feature, apply the following patch to disable and remove the relevant hub cluster and managed cluster pods that are responsible for this add-on.
Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch multiclusterengines.multicluster.openshift.io multiclusterengine --type=merge --patch-file out/argocd/deployment/disable-cluster-proxy-addon.json
----

. Apply the pipeline configuration to your hub cluster by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -k out/argocd/deployment

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="ztp-preparing-the-ztp-git-repository_{context}"]
= Preparing the {ztp} site configuration repository

Before you can use the {ztp-first} pipeline, you need to prepare the Git repository to host the site configuration data.

.Prerequisites

* You have configured the hub cluster GitOps applications for generating the required installation and policy custom resources (CRs).

* You have deployed the managed clusters using {ztp}.

.Procedure

. Create a directory structure with separate paths for the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs.
+
[NOTE]
====
Keep `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs in separate directories.
Both the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` directories must contain a `kustomization.yaml` file that explicitly includes the files in that directory.
====

. Export the `argocd` directory from the `ztp-site-generate` container image using the following commands:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman pull registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ztp-site-generate-rhel8:v{product-version}
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir -p ./out
----
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run --log-driver=none --rm registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ztp-site-generate-rhel8:v{product-version} extract /home/ztp --tar | tar x -C ./out
----


. Check that the `out` directory contains the following subdirectories:
+
* `out/extra-manifest` contains the source CR files that `SiteConfig` uses to generate extra manifest `configMap`.
* `out/source-crs` contains the source CR files that `PolicyGenTemplate` uses to generate the {rh-rhacm-first} policies.
* `out/argocd/deployment` contains patches and YAML files to apply on the hub cluster for use in the next step of this procedure.
* `out/argocd/example` contains the examples for `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` files that represent the recommended configuration.


. Copy the `out/source-crs` folder and contents to the `PolicyGentemplate` directory.

. The out/extra-manifests directory contains the reference manifests for a RAN DU cluster.
Copy the `out/extra-manifests` directory into the `SiteConfig` folder.
This directory should contain CRs from the `ztp-site-generate` container only.
Do not add user-provided CRs here.
If you want to work with user-provided CRs you must create another directory for that content.
For example:
+
[source,text]
----
example/
  ├── policygentemplates
  │   ├── kustomization.yaml
  │   └── source-crs/
  └── siteconfig
        ├── extra-manifests
        └── kustomization.yaml
----

. Commit the directory structure and the `kustomization.yaml` files and push to your Git repository.
The initial push to Git should include the `kustomization.yaml` files.

You can use the directory structure under `out/argocd/example` as a reference for the structure and content of your Git repository.
That structure includes `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` reference CRs for single-node, three-node, and standard clusters.
Remove references to cluster types that you are not using.

For all cluster types, you must:

* Add the `source-crs` subdirectory to the `policygentemplate` directory.
* Add the `extra-manifests` directory to the `siteconfig` directory.

The following example describes a set of CRs for a network of single-node clusters:

[id="ztp-preparing-the-ztp-git-repository-ver-ind_{context}"]
= Preparing the {ztp} site configuration repository for version independence

You can use {ztp} to manage source custom resources (CRs) for managed clusters that are running different versions of {product-title}.
This means that the version of {product-title} running on the hub cluster can be independent of the version running on the managed clusters.

.Procedure

. Create a directory structure with separate paths for the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs.

. Within the `PolicyGenTemplate` directory, create a directory for each {product-title} version you want to make available.
For each version, create the following resources:
* `kustomization.yaml` file that explicitly includes the files in that directory
* `source-crs` directory to contain reference CR configuration files from the `ztp-site-generate` container

. In the `/siteconfig` directory, create a subdirectory for each {product-title} version you want to make available. For each version, create at least one directory for reference CRs to be copied from the container. There is no restriction on the naming of directories or on the number of reference directories. If you want to work with user-provided CRs, you must create a separate directory for those.
+
The following example describes a structure using user-provided CRs for different versions of {product-title}:

----
<1> Create a top-level `kustomization` yaml file.
<2> Create the version-specific directories within the custom `/policygentemplates` directory.
<3> Create a `kustomization.yaml` file for each version.
<4> Create a `source-crs` directory for each version to contain reference CRs from the `ztp-site-generate` container.
<5> Create a directory within the custom `/siteconfig` directory to contain extra manifests from the `ztp-site-generate` container.
<6> Create a folder to hold user-provided CRs.
+
[NOTE]
====
In the previous example, each version subdirectory in the custom `/siteconfig` directory contains two further subdirectories, one containing the reference manifests copied from the container, the other for custom manifests that you provide.
The names assigned to those directories are examples.
If you use user-provided CRs, the last directory listed under `extraManifests.searchPaths` in the `SiteConfig` CR must be the directory containing user-provided CRs.
====

. Edit the `SiteConfig` CR to include the search paths of any directories you have created.
The first directory that is listed under `extraManifests.searchPaths` must be the directory containing the reference manifests.
Consider the order in which the directories are listed.
In cases where directories contain files with the same name, the file in the final directory takes precedence.

You can provision {product-title} clusters at scale with {rh-rhacm-first} using the assisted service and the GitOps plugin policy generator with core-reduction technology enabled. The {ztp-first} pipeline performs the cluster installations. {ztp} can be used in a disconnected environment.

[id="ztp-talo-integration_{context}"]
= {ztp} and {cgu-operator-full}

{ztp-first} generates installation and configuration CRs from manifests stored in Git. These artifacts are applied to a centralized hub cluster where {rh-rhacm-first}, the assisted service, and the {cgu-operator-first} use the CRs to install and configure the managed cluster. The configuration phase of the {ztp} pipeline uses the {cgu-operator} to orchestrate the application of the configuration CRs to the cluster. There are several key integration points between {ztp} and the {cgu-operator}.

Inform policies::
By default, {ztp} creates all policies with a remediation action of `inform`. These policies cause {rh-rhacm} to report on compliance status of clusters relevant to the policies but does not apply the desired configuration. During the {ztp} process, after OpenShift installation, the {cgu-operator} steps through the created `inform` policies and enforces them on the target managed cluster(s). This applies the configuration to the managed cluster. Outside of the {ztp} phase of the cluster lifecycle, this allows you to change policies without the risk of immediately rolling those changes out to affected managed clusters. You can control the timing and the set of remediated clusters by using {cgu-operator}.

Automatic creation of ClusterGroupUpgrade CRs::
To automate the initial configuration of newly deployed clusters, {cgu-operator} monitors the state of all `ManagedCluster` CRs on the hub cluster. Any `ManagedCluster` CR that does not have a `ztp-done` label applied, including newly created `ManagedCluster` CRs, causes the {cgu-operator} to automatically create a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the following characteristics:

* The `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR is created and enabled in the `ztp-install` namespace.
* `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR has the same name as the `ManagedCluster` CR.
* The cluster selector includes only the cluster associated with that `ManagedCluster` CR.
* The set of managed policies includes all policies that {rh-rhacm} has bound to the cluster at the time the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` is created.
* Pre-caching is disabled.
* Timeout set to 4 hours (240 minutes).

+
The automatic creation of an enabled `ClusterGroupUpgrade` ensures that initial zero-touch deployment of clusters proceeds without the need for user intervention. Additionally, the automatic creation of a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR for any `ManagedCluster` without the `ztp-done` label allows a failed {ztp} installation to be restarted by simply deleting the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR for the cluster.

Waves::
Each policy generated from a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR includes a `ztp-deploy-wave` annotation. This annotation is based on the same annotation from each CR which is included in that policy. The wave annotation is used to order the policies in the auto-generated `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. The wave annotation is not used other than for the auto-generated `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.
+
[NOTE]
====
All CRs in the same policy must have the same setting for the `ztp-deploy-wave` annotation. The default value of this annotation for each CR can be overridden in the `PolicyGenTemplate`. The wave annotation in the source CR is used for determining and setting the policy wave annotation. This annotation is removed from each built CR which is included in the generated policy at runtime.
====
+
The {cgu-operator} applies the configuration policies in the order specified by the wave annotations. The {cgu-operator} waits for each policy to be compliant before moving to the next policy. It is important to ensure that the wave annotation for each CR takes into account any prerequisites for those CRs to be applied to the cluster. For example, an Operator must be installed before or concurrently with the configuration for the Operator. Similarly, the `CatalogSource` for an Operator must be installed in a wave before or concurrently with the Operator Subscription. The default wave value for each CR takes these prerequisites into account.
+
Multiple CRs and policies can share the same wave number. Having fewer policies can result in faster deployments and lower CPU usage. It is a best practice to group many CRs into relatively few waves.

To check the default wave value in each source CR, run the following command against the `out/source-crs` directory that is extracted from the `ztp-site-generate` container image:

[source,terminal]
----
$ grep -r "ztp-deploy-wave" out/source-crs
----

Phase labels::
The `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR is automatically created and includes directives to annotate the `ManagedCluster` CR with labels at the start and end of the {ztp} process.
+
When {ztp} configuration postinstallation commences, the `ManagedCluster` has the `ztp-running` label applied. When all policies are remediated to the cluster and are fully compliant, these directives cause the {cgu-operator} to remove the `ztp-running` label and apply the `ztp-done` label.
+
For deployments that make use of the `informDuValidator` policy, the `ztp-done` label is applied when the cluster is fully ready for deployment of applications. This includes all reconciliation and resulting effects of the {ztp} applied configuration CRs. The `ztp-done` label affects automatic `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR creation by {cgu-operator}. Do not manipulate this label after the initial {ztp} installation of the cluster.

Linked CRs::
The automatically created `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR has the owner reference set as the `ManagedCluster` from which it was derived. This reference ensures that deleting the `ManagedCluster` CR causes the instance of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` to be deleted along with any supporting resources.

= Overview of deploying managed clusters with {ztp}

{rh-rhacm-first} uses {ztp-first} to deploy single-node {product-title} clusters, three-node clusters, and standard clusters. You manage site configuration data as {product-title} custom resources (CRs) in a Git repository. {ztp} uses a declarative GitOps approach for a develop once, deploy anywhere model to deploy the managed clusters.

The deployment of the clusters includes:

* Installing the host operating system (RHCOS) on a blank server

* Deploying {product-title}

* Creating cluster policies and site subscriptions

* Making the necessary network configurations to the server operating system

* Deploying profile Operators and performing any needed software-related configuration, such as performance profile, PTP, and SR-IOV

[id="ztp-overview-managed-site-installation-process_{context}"]
== Overview of the managed site installation process

After you apply the managed site custom resources (CRs) on the hub cluster, the following actions happen automatically:

. A Discovery image ISO file is generated and booted on the target host.

. When the ISO file successfully boots on the target host it reports the host hardware information to {rh-rhacm}.

. After all hosts are discovered, {product-title} is installed.

. When {product-title} finishes installing, the hub installs the `klusterlet` service on the target cluster.

. The requested add-on services are installed on the target cluster.

The Discovery image ISO process is complete when the `Agent` CR  for the managed cluster is created on the hub cluster.

[id="ztp-creating-the-site-secrets_{context}"]
= Creating the managed bare-metal host secrets

Add the required `Secret` custom resources (CRs) for the managed bare-metal host to the hub cluster. You need a secret for the {ztp-first} pipeline to access the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) and a secret for the assisted installer service to pull cluster installation images from the registry.

[NOTE]
====
The secrets are referenced from the `SiteConfig` CR by name. The namespace
must match the `SiteConfig` namespace.
====

.Procedure

. Create a YAML secret file containing credentials for the host Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) and a pull secret required for installing OpenShift and all add-on cluster Operators:

.. Save the following YAML as the file `example-sno-secret.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: example-sno-bmc-secret
  namespace: example-sno <1>
data: <2>
  password: <base64_password>
  username: <base64_username>
type: Opaque
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pull-secret
  namespace: example-sno  <3>
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: <pull_secret> <4>
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----
<1> Must match the namespace configured in the related `SiteConfig` CR
<2> Base64-encoded values for `password` and `username`
<3> Must match the namespace configured in the related `SiteConfig` CR
<4> Base64-encoded pull secret

. Add the relative path to `example-sno-secret.yaml` to the `kustomization.yaml` file that you use to install the cluster.

[id="setting-managed-bare-metal-host-kernel-arguments_{context}"]
= Configuring Discovery ISO kernel arguments for installations using {ztp}

The {ztp-first} workflow uses the Discovery ISO as part of the {product-title} installation process on managed bare-metal hosts. You can edit the `InfraEnv` resource to specify kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO. This is useful for cluster installations with specific environmental requirements. For example, configure the `rd.net.timeout.carrier` kernel argument for the Discovery ISO to facilitate static networking for the cluster or to receive a DHCP address before downloading the root file system during installation.

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} {product-version}, you can only add kernel arguments. You can not replace or delete kernel arguments.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

.Procedure

. Create the `InfraEnv` CR and edit the `spec.kernelArguments` specification to configure kernel arguments.

.. Save the following YAML in an `InfraEnv-example.yaml` file:
+
[NOTE]
====
The `InfraEnv` CR in this example uses template syntax such as `{{ .Cluster.ClusterName }}` that is populated based on values in the `SiteConfig` CR. The `SiteConfig` CR automatically populates values for these templates during deployment. Do not edit the templates manually.
====

----
<1> Specify the append operation to add a kernel argument.
<2> Specify the kernel argument you want to configure. This example configures the audit kernel argument and the trace kernel argument.

. Commit the `InfraEnv-example.yaml` CR to the same location in your Git repository that has the `SiteConfig` CR and push your changes. The following example shows a sample Git repository structure:

+
[source,text]
----
~/example-ztp/install

               ├── siteconfig-example.yaml
               ├── InfraEnv-example.yaml
               ...
----

. Edit the `spec.clusters.crTemplates` specification in the `SiteConfig` CR to reference the `InfraEnv-example.yaml` CR in your Git repository:
+
[source,yaml,options="nowrap",role="white-space-pre"]
----
clusters:
  crTemplates:
    InfraEnv: "InfraEnv-example.yaml"
----
+
When you are ready to deploy your cluster by committing and pushing the `SiteConfig` CR, the build pipeline uses the custom `InfraEnv-example` CR in your Git repository to configure the infrastructure environment, including the custom kernel arguments.

.Verification
To verify that the kernel arguments are applied, after the Discovery image verifies that {product-title} is ready for installation, you can SSH to the target host before the installation process begins. At that point, you can view the kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO in the `/proc/cmdline` file.

. Begin an SSH session with the target host:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh -i /path/to/privatekey core@<host_name>
----

. View the system's kernel arguments by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat /proc/cmdline

[id="ztp-deploying-a-site_{context}"]
= Deploying a managed cluster with SiteConfig and {ztp}

Use the following procedure to create a `SiteConfig` custom resource (CR) and related files and initiate the {ztp-first} cluster deployment.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You configured the hub cluster for generating the required installation and policy CRs.

* You created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data. The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and you must configure it as a source repository for the ArgoCD application. See "Preparing the {ztp} site configuration repository" for more information.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you create the source repository, ensure that you patch the ArgoCD application with the `argocd/deployment/argocd-openshift-gitops-patch.json` patch-file that you extract from the `ztp-site-generate` container. See "Configuring the hub cluster with ArgoCD".
====

* To be ready for provisioning managed clusters, you require the following for each bare-metal host:
+
Network connectivity:: Your network requires DNS. Managed cluster hosts should be reachable from the hub cluster. Ensure that Layer 3 connectivity exists between the hub cluster and the managed cluster host.
+
Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) details:: {ztp} uses BMC username and password details to connect to the BMC during cluster installation. The {ztp} plugin manages the `ManagedCluster` CRs on the hub cluster based on the `SiteConfig` CR in your site Git repo. You create individual `BMCSecret` CRs for each host manually.

.Procedure

. Create the required managed cluster secrets on the hub cluster. These resources must be in a namespace with a name matching the cluster name. For example, in `out/argocd/example/siteconfig/example-sno.yaml`, the cluster name and namespace is `example-sno`.

.. Export the cluster namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export CLUSTERNS=example-sno
----

.. Create the namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create namespace $CLUSTERNS
----

. Create pull secret and BMC `Secret` CRs for the managed cluster. The pull secret must contain all the credentials necessary for installing {product-title} and all required Operators. See "Creating the managed bare-metal host secrets" for more information.
+
[NOTE]
====
The secrets are referenced from the `SiteConfig` custom resource (CR) by name. The namespace must match the `SiteConfig` namespace.
====

. Create a `SiteConfig` CR for your cluster in your local clone of the Git repository:

.. Choose the appropriate example for your CR from the  `out/argocd/example/siteconfig/` folder.
The folder includes example files for single node, three-node, and standard clusters:
+
*** `example-sno.yaml`
*** `example-3node.yaml`
*** `example-standard.yaml`

.. Change the cluster and host details in the example file to match the type of cluster you want. For example:
+
.Example {sno} SiteConfig CR

For more information about BMC addressing, see the "Additional resources" section.
====

.. You can inspect the default set of extra-manifest `MachineConfig` CRs in `out/argocd/extra-manifest`. It is automatically applied to the cluster when it is installed.

.. Optional: To provision additional install-time manifests on the provisioned cluster, create a directory in your Git repository, for example, `sno-extra-manifest/`, and add your custom manifest CRs to this directory. If your `SiteConfig.yaml` refers to this directory in the `extraManifestPath` field, any CRs in this referenced directory are appended to the default set of extra manifests.
+
.Enabling the crun OCI container runtime
[IMPORTANT]
====
For optimal cluster performance, enable crun for master and worker nodes in {sno}, {sno} with additional worker nodes, {3no}, and standard clusters.

Enable crun in a `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR as an additional Day 0 install-time manifest to avoid the cluster having to reboot.

The `enable-crun-master.yaml` and `enable-crun-worker.yaml` CR files are in the `out/source-crs/optional-extra-manifest/` folder that you can extract from the `ztp-site-generate` container.
For more information, see "Customizing extra installation manifests in the {ztp} pipeline".
====

. Add the `SiteConfig` CR to the `kustomization.yaml` file in the `generators` section, similar to the example shown in `out/argocd/example/siteconfig/kustomization.yaml`.

. Commit the `SiteConfig` CR and associated `kustomization.yaml` changes in your Git repository and push the changes.
+
The ArgoCD pipeline detects the changes and begins the managed cluster deployment.

.Verification

* Verify that the custom roles and labels are applied after the node is deployed:

.SiteConfig CR installation options for {sno} clusters
[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|====
|SiteConfig CR field
|Description

|`spec.cpuPartitioningMode`
a|Configure workload partitioning by setting the value for `cpuPartitioningMode` to `AllNodes`.
To complete the configuration, specify the `isolated` and `reserved` CPUs in the `PerformanceProfile` CR.

[NOTE]
====
Configuring workload partitioning by using the `cpuPartitioningMode` field in the `SiteConfig` CR is a Tech Preview feature in {product-title} 4.13.
====

|`metadata.name`
|Set `name` to `assisted-deployment-pull-secret` and create the `assisted-deployment-pull-secret` CR in the same namespace as the `SiteConfig` CR.

|`clusterImageSetNameRef`
|Configure the image set available on the hub cluster.
To see the list of supported versions on your hub cluster, run `oc get clusterimagesets`.

|`installConfigOverrides`
a|Set the `installConfigOverrides` field to enable or disable optional components prior to cluster installation.
[IMPORTANT]
====
Use the reference configuration as specified in the example `SiteConfig` CR.
Adding additional components back into the system might require additional reserved CPU capacity.
====

|`spec.clusters.clusterLabels`
|Configure cluster labels to correspond to the `bindingRules` field in the `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs that you define.
For example, `policygentemplates/common-ranGen.yaml` applies to all clusters with `common: true` set, `policygentemplates/group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` applies to all clusters with `group-du-sno: ""` set.

|`spec.clusters.crTemplates.KlusterletAddonConfig`
|Optional. Set `KlusterletAddonConfig` to `KlusterletAddonConfigOverride.yaml to override the default `KlusterletAddonConfig` that is created for the cluster.

|`spec.clusters.nodes.hostName`
|For single-node deployments, define a single host.
For three-node deployments, define three hosts.
For standard deployments, define three hosts with `role: master` and two or more hosts defined with `role: worker`.

|`spec.clusters.nodes.nodeLabels`
|Specify custom roles for your nodes in your managed clusters. These are additional roles are not used by any {product-title} components, only by the user. When you add a custom role, it can be associated with a custom machine config pool that references a specific configuration for that role. Adding custom labels or roles during installation makes the deployment process more effective and prevents the need for additional reboots after the installation is complete.

|`spec.clusters.nodes.automatedCleaningMode`
|Optional. Uncomment and set the value to `metadata` to enable the removal of the disk's partitioning table only, without fully wiping the disk. The default value is `disabled`.

|`spec.clusters.nodes.bmcAddress`
|BMC address that you use to access the host. Applies to all cluster types. {ztp} supports iPXE and virtual media booting by using Redfish or IPMI protocols. To use iPXE booting, you must use {rh-rhacm} 2.8 or later. For more information about BMC addressing, see the "Additional resources" section.

|`spec.clusters.nodes.bmcAddress`
a|BMC address that you use to access the host.
Applies to all cluster types.
{ztp} supports iPXE and virtual media booting by using Redfish or IPMI protocols.
To use iPXE booting, you must use {rh-rhacm} 2.8 or later.
For more information about BMC addressing, see the "Additional resources" section.
[NOTE]
====
In far edge Telco use cases, only virtual media is supported for use with {ztp}.
====

|`spec.clusters.nodes.bmcCredentialsName`
|Configure the `bmh-secret` CR that you separately create with the host BMC credentials.
When creating the `bmh-secret` CR, use the same namespace as the `SiteConfig` CR that provisions the host.

|`spec.clusters.nodes.bootMode`
|Set the boot mode for the host to `UEFI`.
The default value is `UEFI`. Use `UEFISecureBoot` to enable secure boot on the host.

|`spec.clusters.nodes.rootDeviceHints`
|Specifies the device for deployment. Identifiers that are stable across reboots are recommended, for example, `wwn: <disk_wwn>` or `deviceName: /dev/disk/by-path/<device_path>`. For a detailed list of stable identifiers, see the "About root device hints section".

|`spec.clusters.nodes.diskPartition`
|Optional. The provided example `diskPartition` is used to configure additional disk partitions.

|`spec.clusters.nodes.ignitionConfigOverride`
|Optional. Use this field to assign partitions for persistent storage.
Adjust disk ID and size to the specific hardware.

|`spec.clusters.nodes.cpuset`
|Configure `cpuset` to match value that you set in the cluster `PerformanceProfile` CR `spec.cpu.reserved` field for workload partitioning.

|`spec.clusters.nodes.nodeNetwork`
|Configure the network settings for the node.

|`spec.clusters.nodes.nodeNetwork.config.interfaces.ipv6`
|Configure the IPv6 address for the host.
For {sno} clusters with static IP addresses, the node-specific API and Ingress IPs should be the same.

[id="ztp-monitoring-deployment-progress_{context}"]
= Monitoring managed cluster installation progress

The ArgoCD pipeline uses the `SiteConfig` CR to generate the cluster configuration CRs and syncs it with the hub cluster. You can monitor the progress of the synchronization in the ArgoCD dashboard.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

When the synchronization is complete, the installation generally proceeds as follows:

. The Assisted Service Operator installs {product-title} on the cluster. You can monitor the progress of cluster installation from the {rh-rhacm} dashboard or from the command line by running the following commands:

.. Export the cluster name:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export CLUSTER=<clusterName>
----

.. Query the `AgentClusterInstall` CR for the managed cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get agentclusterinstall -n $CLUSTER $CLUSTER -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Completed")]}' | jq
----

.. Get the installation events for the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -sk $(oc get agentclusterinstall -n $CLUSTER $CLUSTER -o jsonpath='{.status.debugInfo.eventsURL}')  | jq '.[-2,-1]'

[id="ztp-troubleshooting-ztp-gitops-installation-crs_{context}"]
= Troubleshooting {ztp} by validating the installation CRs

The ArgoCD pipeline uses the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resources (CRs) to generate the cluster configuration CRs and {rh-rhacm-first} policies. Use the following steps to troubleshoot issues that might occur during this process.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Check that the installation CRs were created by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get AgentClusterInstall -n <cluster_name>
----
+
If no object is returned, use the following steps to troubleshoot the ArgoCD pipeline flow from `SiteConfig` files to the installation CRs.

. Verify that the `ManagedCluster` CR was generated using the `SiteConfig` CR on the hub cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedcluster
----

. If the `ManagedCluster` is missing, check if the `clusters` application failed to synchronize the files from the Git repository to the hub cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe -n openshift-gitops application clusters
----

.. Check for the `Status.Conditions` field to view the error logs for the managed cluster. For example, setting an invalid value for `extraManifestPath:` in the `SiteConfig` CR raises the following error:
+

[id="ztp-troubleshooting-ztp-gitops-supermicro-tls_{context}"]
= Troubleshooting {ztp} virtual media booting on Supermicro servers

SuperMicro X11 servers do not support virtual media installations when the image is served using the `https` protocol. As a result, {sno} deployments for this environment fail to boot on the target node. To avoid this issue, log in to the hub cluster and disable Transport Layer Security (TLS) in the `Provisioning` resource. This ensures the image is not served with TLS even though the image address uses the `https` scheme.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Disable TLS in the `Provisioning` resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch provisioning provisioning-configuration --type merge -p '{"spec":{"disableVirtualMediaTLS": true}}'
----

. Continue the steps to deploy your {sno} cluster.

[id="ztp-site-cleanup_{context}"]
= Removing a managed cluster site from the {ztp} pipeline

You can remove a managed site and the associated installation and configuration policy CRs from the {ztp-first} pipeline.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Remove a site and the associated CRs by removing the associated `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` files from the `kustomization.yaml` file.
+
When you run the {ztp} pipeline again, the generated CRs are removed.

. Optional: If you want to permanently remove a site, you should also remove the `SiteConfig` and site-specific `PolicyGenTemplate` files from the Git repository.

. Optional: If you want to remove a site temporarily, for example when redeploying a site, you can leave the `SiteConfig` and site-specific `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs in the Git repository.

[NOTE]
====
After removing the `SiteConfig` file from the Git repository, if the corresponding clusters get stuck in the detach process, check {rh-rhacm-first} on the hub cluster for information about cleaning up the detached cluster.

[id="ztp-removing-obsolete-content_{context}"]
= Removing obsolete content from the {ztp} pipeline

If a change to the `PolicyGenTemplate` configuration results in obsolete policies, for example, if you rename policies, use the following procedure to remove the obsolete policies.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Remove the affected `PolicyGenTemplate` files from the Git repository, commit and push to the remote repository.

. Wait for the changes to synchronize through the application and the affected policies to be removed from the hub cluster.

. Add the updated `PolicyGenTemplate` files back to the Git repository, and then commit and push to the remote repository.
+
[NOTE]
====
Removing {ztp-first} policies from the Git repository, and as a result also removing them from the hub cluster, does not affect the configuration of the managed cluster. The policy and CRs managed by that policy remains in place on the managed cluster.
====

. Optional: As an alternative, after making changes to `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs that result in obsolete policies, you can remove these policies from the hub cluster manually. You can delete policies from the {rh-rhacm} console using the *Governance* tab or by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]

[id="ztp-the-policygentemplate_{context}"]
= About the PolicyGenTemplate CRD

The `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resource definition (CRD) tells the `PolicyGen` policy generator what custom resources (CRs) to include in the cluster configuration, how to combine the CRs into the generated policies, and what items in those CRs need to be updated with overlay content.

The following example shows a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR (`common-du-ranGen.yaml`) extracted from the `ztp-site-generate` reference container. The `common-du-ranGen.yaml` file defines two {rh-rhacm-first} policies. The polices manage a collection of configuration CRs, one for each unique value of `policyName` in the CR. `common-du-ranGen.yaml` creates a single placement binding and a placement rule to bind the policies to clusters based on the labels listed in the `bindingRules` section.

A `PolicyGenTemplate` CR can be constructed with any number of included CRs. Apply the following example CR in the hub cluster to generate a policy containing a single CR:

The `PtpConfig` CR defined in the generated `group-du-sno-config-policy` is named `du-ptp-slave`. The `spec` defined in `PtpConfigSlave.yaml` is placed under `du-ptp-slave` along with the other `spec` items defined under the source file.

= Recommendations when customizing PolicyGenTemplate CRs

Consider the following best practices when customizing site configuration `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resources (CRs):

* Use as few policies as are necessary. Using fewer policies requires less resources. Each additional policy creates overhead for the hub cluster and the deployed managed cluster. CRs are combined into policies based on the `policyName` field in the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR. CRs in the same `PolicyGenTemplate` which have the same value for `policyName` are managed under a single policy.

* In disconnected environments, use a single catalog source for all Operators by configuring the registry as a single index containing all Operators. Each additional `CatalogSource` CR on the managed clusters increases CPU usage.

* `MachineConfig` CRs should be included as `extraManifests` in the `SiteConfig` CR so that they are applied during installation. This can reduce the overall time taken until the cluster is ready to deploy applications.

* `PolicyGenTemplates` should override the channel field to explicitly identify the desired version. This ensures that changes in the source CR during upgrades does not update the generated subscription.

[NOTE]
====
When managing large numbers of spoke clusters on the hub cluster, minimize the number of policies to reduce resource consumption.

Grouping multiple configuration CRs into a single or limited number of policies is one way to reduce the overall number of policies on the hub cluster. When using the common, group, and site hierarchy of policies for managing site configuration, it is especially important to combine site-specific configuration into a single policy.

= PolicyGenTemplate CRs for RAN deployments

Use `PolicyGenTemplate` (PGT) custom resources (CRs) to customize the configuration applied to the cluster by using the {ztp-first} pipeline. The PGT CR allows you to generate one or more policies to manage the set of configuration CRs on your fleet of clusters. The PGT identifies the set of managed CRs, bundles them into policies, builds the policy wrapping around those CRs, and associates the policies with clusters by using label binding rules.

The reference configuration, obtained from the {ztp} container, is designed to provide a set of critical features and node tuning settings that ensure the cluster can support the stringent performance and resource utilization constraints typical of RAN (Radio Access Network) Distributed Unit (DU) applications. Changes or omissions from the baseline configuration can affect feature availability, performance, and resource utilization. Use the reference `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs as the basis to create a hierarchy of configuration files tailored to your specific site requirements.

The baseline `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs that are defined for RAN DU cluster configuration can be extracted from the {ztp} `ztp-site-generate` container. See "Preparing the {ztp} site configuration repository" for further details.

The `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs can be found in the `./out/argocd/example/policygentemplates` folder. The reference architecture has common, group, and site-specific configuration CRs. Each `PolicyGenTemplate` CR refers to other CRs that can be found in the `./out/source-crs` folder.

The `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs relevant to RAN cluster configuration are described below. Variants are provided for the group `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs to account for differences in single-node, three-node compact, and standard cluster configurations. Similarly, site-specific configuration variants are provided for single-node clusters and multi-node (compact or standard) clusters. Use the group and site-specific configuration variants that are relevant for your deployment.

[id="ztp-customizing-a-managed-site-using-pgt_{context}"]
= Customizing a managed cluster with PolicyGenTemplate CRs

Use the following procedure to customize the policies that get applied to the managed cluster that you provision using the {ztp-first} pipeline.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You configured the hub cluster for generating the required installation and policy CRs.

* You created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data. The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for the Argo CD application.

.Procedure

. Create a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR for site-specific configuration CRs.

.. Choose the appropriate example for your CR from the `out/argocd/example/policygentemplates` folder, for example, `example-sno-site.yaml` or `example-multinode-site.yaml`.

.. Change the `bindingRules` field in the example file to match the site-specific label included in the `SiteConfig` CR. In the example `SiteConfig` file, the site-specific label is `sites: example-sno`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that the labels defined in your `PolicyGenTemplate` `bindingRules` field correspond to the labels that are defined in the related managed clusters `SiteConfig` CR.
====

.. Change the content in the example file to match the desired configuration.

. Optional: Create a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR for any common configuration CRs that apply to the entire fleet of clusters.

.. Select the appropriate example for your CR from the `out/argocd/example/policygentemplates` folder, for example, `common-ranGen.yaml`.

.. Change the content in the example file to match the desired configuration.

. Optional: Create a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR for any group configuration CRs that apply to the certain groups of clusters in the fleet.
+
Ensure that the content of the overlaid spec files matches your desired end state. As a reference, the out/source-crs directory contains the full list of source-crs available to be included and overlaid by your PolicyGenTemplate templates.
+
[NOTE]
====
Depending on the specific requirements of your clusters, you might need more than a single group policy per cluster type, especially considering that the example group policies each have a single PerformancePolicy.yaml file that can only be shared across a set of clusters if those clusters consist of identical hardware configurations.
====

.. Select the appropriate example for your CR from the `out/argocd/example/policygentemplates` folder, for example, `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml`.

.. Change the content in the example file to match the desired configuration.

. Optional. Create a validator inform policy `PolicyGenTemplate` CR to signal when the {ztp} installation and configuration of the deployed cluster is complete. For more information, see "Creating a validator inform policy".

. Define all the policy namespaces in a YAML file similar to the example `out/argocd/example/policygentemplates/ns.yaml` file.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not include the `Namespace` CR in the same file with the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR.
====

. Add the `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs and `Namespace` CR to the `kustomization.yaml` file in the generators section, similar to the example shown in `out/argocd/example/policygentemplates/kustomization.yaml`.

. Commit the `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs, `Namespace` CR, and associated `kustomization.yaml` file in your Git repository and push the changes.
+
The ArgoCD pipeline detects the changes and begins the managed cluster deployment. You can push the changes to the `SiteConfig` CR and the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR simultaneously.

= Monitoring managed cluster policy deployment progress

The ArgoCD pipeline uses `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs in Git to generate the {rh-rhacm} policies and then sync them to the hub cluster. You can monitor the progress of the managed cluster policy synchronization after the assisted service installs {product-title} on the managed cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. The {cgu-operator-first} applies the configuration policies that are bound to the cluster.
+
After the cluster installation is complete and the cluster becomes `Ready`, a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR corresponding to this cluster, with a list of ordered policies defined by the `ran.openshift.io/ztp-deploy-wave annotations`, is automatically created by the {cgu-operator}. The cluster's policies are applied in the order listed in `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.
+
You can monitor the high-level progress of configuration policy reconciliation by using the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export CLUSTER=<clusterName>
----
+
[source,terminal]

.. To check policy status from the {rh-rhacm} web console, perform the following actions:

... Click *Governance* -> *Find policies*.
... Click on a cluster policy to check it's status.

When all of the cluster policies become compliant, {ztp} installation and configuration for the cluster is complete. The `ztp-done` label is added to the cluster.

In the reference configuration, the final policy that becomes compliant is the one defined in the `*-du-validator-policy` policy. This policy, when compliant on a cluster, ensures that all cluster configuration, Operator installation, and Operator configuration is complete.

= Validating the generation of configuration policy CRs

Policy custom resources (CRs) are generated in the same namespace as the `PolicyGenTemplate` from which they are created. The same troubleshooting flow applies to all policy CRs generated from a `PolicyGenTemplate` regardless of whether they are `ztp-common`, `ztp-group`, or `ztp-site` based, as shown using the following commands:

The expected set of policy-wrapped CRs should be displayed.

If the policies failed synchronization, use the following troubleshooting steps.

.Procedure

. To display detailed information about the policies, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe -n openshift-gitops application policies
----

. Check for `Status: Conditions:` to show the error logs. For example, setting an invalid `sourceFile→fileName:` generates the error shown below:

{rh-rhacm} copies all applicable policies into the cluster namespace. The copied policy names have the format: `<policyGenTemplate.Namespace>.<policyGenTemplate.Name>-<policyName>`.

. Check the placement rule for any policies not copied to the cluster namespace. The `matchSelector` in the `PlacementRule` for those policies should match labels on the `ManagedCluster` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get placementrule -n $NS
----

. Note the `PlacementRule` name appropriate for the missing policy, common, group, or site, using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get placementrule -n $NS <placementRuleName> -o yaml
----
+
* The status-decisions should include your cluster name.
* The key-value pair of the `matchSelector` in the spec must match the labels on your managed cluster.

. Check the labels on the `ManagedCluster` object using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ManagedCluster $CLUSTER -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}' | jq
----

. Check to see which policies are compliant using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policy -n $CLUSTER
----
+
If the `Namespace`, `OperatorGroup`, and `Subscription` policies are compliant but the Operator configuration policies are not, it is likely that the Operators did not install on the managed cluster. This causes the Operator configuration policies to fail to apply because the CRD is not yet applied to the spoke.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="ztp-restarting-policies-reconciliation_{context}"]
= Restarting policy reconciliation

You can restart policy reconciliation when unexpected compliance issues occur, for example, when the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` custom resource (CR) has timed out.

.Procedure

. A `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR is generated in the namespace `ztp-install` by the {cgu-operator-full} after the managed cluster becomes `Ready`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export CLUSTER=<clusterName>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clustergroupupgrades -n ztp-install $CLUSTER
----

. If there are unexpected issues and the policies fail to become complaint within the configured timeout (the default is 4 hours), the status of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR shows `UpgradeTimedOut`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clustergroupupgrades -n ztp-install $CLUSTER -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")]}'
----

. A `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR in the `UpgradeTimedOut` state automatically restarts its policy reconciliation every hour. If you have changed your policies, you can start a retry immediately by deleting the existing `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. This triggers the automatic creation of a new `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR that begins reconciling the policies immediately:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete clustergroupupgrades -n ztp-install $CLUSTER
----

Note that when the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR completes with status `UpgradeCompleted` and the managed cluster has the label `ztp-done` applied, you can make additional configuration changes using `PolicyGenTemplate`. Deleting the existing `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR will not make the {cgu-operator} generate a new CR.

At this point, {ztp} has completed its interaction with the cluster and any further interactions should be treated as an update and a new `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR created for remediation of the policies.

[id="ztp-removing-content-from-managed-clusters_{context}"]
= Changing applied managed cluster CRs using policies

You can remove content from a custom resource (CR) that is deployed in a managed cluster through a policy.

By default, all `Policy` CRs created from a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR have the `complianceType` field set to `musthave`.
A `musthave` policy without the removed content is still compliant because the CR on the managed cluster has all the specified content.
With this configuration, when you remove content from a CR, {cgu-operator} removes the content from the policy but the content is not removed from the CR on the managed cluster.

With the `complianceType` field to `mustonlyhave`, the policy ensures that the CR on the cluster is an exact match of what is specified in the policy.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have deployed a managed cluster from a hub cluster running {rh-rhacm}.

* You have installed {cgu-operator-full} on the hub cluster.

.Procedure

. Remove the content that you no longer need from the affected CRs. In this example, the `disableDrain: false` line was removed from the `SriovOperatorConfig` CR.

[id="ztp-definition-of-done-for-ztp-installations_{context}"]
= Indication of done for {ztp} installations

{ztp-first} simplifies the process of checking the {ztp} installation status for a cluster. The {ztp} status moves through three phases: cluster installation, cluster configuration, and {ztp} done.

Cluster installation phase::
The cluster installation phase is shown by the `ManagedClusterJoined` and  `ManagedClusterAvailable` conditions in the `ManagedCluster` CR . If the `ManagedCluster` CR does not have these conditions, or the condition is set to `False`, the cluster is still in the installation phase. Additional details about installation are available from the `AgentClusterInstall` and `ClusterDeployment` CRs. For more information, see "Troubleshooting {ztp}".

Cluster configuration phase::
The cluster configuration phase is shown by a `ztp-running` label applied the `ManagedCluster` CR for the cluster.

{ztp} done::
Cluster installation and configuration is complete in the {ztp} done phase. This is shown by the removal of the `ztp-running` label and addition of the `ztp-done` label to the `ManagedCluster` CR. The `ztp-done` label shows that the configuration has been applied and the baseline DU configuration has completed cluster tuning.
+
The transition to the {ztp} done state is conditional on the compliant state of a {rh-rhacm-first} validator inform policy. This policy captures the existing criteria for a completed installation and validates that it moves to a compliant state only when {ztp} provisioning of the managed cluster is complete.
+
The validator inform policy ensures the configuration of the cluster is fully applied and Operators have completed their initialization. The policy validates the following:
+
* The target `MachineConfigPool` contains the expected entries and has finished updating. All nodes are available and not degraded.

* The SR-IOV Operator has completed initialization as indicated by at least one `SriovNetworkNodeState` with `syncStatus: Succeeded`.

* The PTP Operator daemon set exists.

You can deploy a managed {sno} cluster by using {rh-rhacm-first} and the assisted service.

[NOTE]
====
If you are creating multiple managed clusters, use the `SiteConfig` method described in xref:../../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites.adoc#ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites[Deploying far edge sites with ZTP].
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The target bare-metal host must meet the networking, firmware, and hardware requirements listed in xref:../../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-reference-cluster-configuration-for-vdu.adoc#sno-configure-for-vdu[Recommended cluster configuration for vDU application workloads].

= Generating {ztp} installation and configuration CRs manually

Use the `generator` entrypoint for the `ztp-site-generate` container to generate the site installation and configuration custom resource (CRs) for a cluster based on `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create an output folder by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir -p ./out
----

. Export the `argocd` directory from the `ztp-site-generate` container image:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run --log-driver=none --rm registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ztp-site-generate-rhel8:v{product-version} extract /home/ztp --tar | tar x -C ./out
----
+
The `./out` directory has the reference `PolicyGenTemplate` and `SiteConfig` CRs in the `out/argocd/example/` folder.
+

[NOTE]
====
Once you have extracted reference CR configuration files from the `out/extra-manifest` directory of the `ztp-site-generate` container, you can use `extraManifests.searchPaths` to include the path to the git directory containing those files.
This allows the {ztp} pipeline to apply those CR files during cluster installation.
If you configure a `searchPaths` directory, the {ztp} pipeline does not fetch manifests from the `ztp-site-generate` container during site installation.
====

. Generate the Day 0 installation CRs by processing the modified `SiteConfig` CR `site-1-sno.yaml` by running the following command:

[id="ztp-creating-the-site-secrets_{context}"]
= Creating the managed bare-metal host secrets

Add the required `Secret` custom resources (CRs) for the managed bare-metal host to the hub cluster. You need a secret for the {ztp-first} pipeline to access the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) and a secret for the assisted installer service to pull cluster installation images from the registry.

[NOTE]
====
The secrets are referenced from the `SiteConfig` CR by name. The namespace
must match the `SiteConfig` namespace.
====

.Procedure

. Create a YAML secret file containing credentials for the host Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) and a pull secret required for installing OpenShift and all add-on cluster Operators:

.. Save the following YAML as the file `example-sno-secret.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: example-sno-bmc-secret
  namespace: example-sno <1>

<2> Base64-encoded values for `password` and `username`
<3> Must match the namespace configured in the related `SiteConfig` CR
<4> Base64-encoded pull secret

. Add the relative path to `example-sno-secret.yaml` to the `kustomization.yaml` file that you use to install the cluster.

[id="setting-managed-bare-metal-host-kernel-arguments_{context}"]
= Configuring Discovery ISO kernel arguments for manual installations using {ztp}

The {ztp-first} workflow uses the Discovery ISO as part of the {product-title} installation process on managed bare-metal hosts. You can edit the `InfraEnv` resource to specify kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO. This is useful for cluster installations with specific environmental requirements. For example, configure the `rd.net.timeout.carrier` kernel argument for the Discovery ISO to facilitate static networking for the cluster or to receive a DHCP address before downloading the root file system during installation.

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} {product-version}, you can only add kernel arguments. You can not replace or delete kernel arguments.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have manually generated the installation and configuration custom resources (CRs).

.Procedure

. Edit the `spec.kernelArguments` specification in the `InfraEnv` CR to configure kernel arguments:

[source,yaml,options="nowrap",role="white-space-pre"]
----
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: InfraEnv
metadata:
  name: <cluster_name>
  namespace: <cluster_name>
spec:
  kernelArguments:
    - operation: append <1>
      value: audit=0 <2>
    - operation: append
      value: trace=1
  clusterRef:
    name: <cluster_name>
    namespace: <cluster_name>
  pullSecretRef:
    name: pull-secret
----
<1> Specify the append operation to add a kernel argument.
<2> Specify the kernel argument you want to configure. This example configures the audit kernel argument and the trace kernel argument.

[NOTE]
====
The `SiteConfig` CR generates the `InfraEnv` resource as part of the day-0 installation CRs.
====

.Verification
To verify that the kernel arguments are applied, after the Discovery image verifies that {product-title} is ready for installation, you can SSH to the target host before the installation process begins. At that point, you can view the kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO in the `/proc/cmdline` file.

. Begin an SSH session with the target host:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh -i /path/to/privatekey core@<host_name>
----

. View the system's kernel arguments by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat /proc/cmdline

[id="ztp-manually-install-a-single-managed-cluster_{context}"]
= Installing a single managed cluster

You can manually deploy a single managed cluster using the assisted service and {rh-rhacm-first}.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have created the baseboard management controller (BMC) `Secret` and the image pull-secret `Secret` custom resources (CRs). See "Creating the managed bare-metal host secrets" for details.

* Your target bare-metal host meets the networking and hardware requirements for managed clusters.

.Procedure

. Create a `ClusterImageSet` for each specific cluster version to be deployed, for example `clusterImageSet-{product-version}.yaml`. A `ClusterImageSet` has the following format:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: hive.openshift.io/v1

----
<1> The descriptive version that you want to deploy.
<2> Specifies the `releaseImage` to deploy and determines the operating system image version. The discovery ISO is based on the image version as set by `releaseImage`, or the latest version if the exact version is unavailable.

. Apply the `clusterImageSet` CR:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc apply -f clusterImageSet-{product-version}.yaml
----

. Create the `Namespace` CR in the `cluster-namespace.yaml` file:
+

= {rh-rhacm} generated cluster installation CRs reference

{rh-rhacm-first} supports deploying {product-title} on single-node clusters, three-node clusters, and standard clusters with a specific set of installation custom resources (CRs) that you generate using `SiteConfig` CRs for each site.

[NOTE]
====
Every managed cluster has its own namespace, and all of the installation CRs except for `ManagedCluster` and `ClusterImageSet` are under that namespace. `ManagedCluster` and `ClusterImageSet` are cluster-scoped, not namespace-scoped. The namespace and the CR names match the cluster name.
====

The following table lists the installation CRs that are automatically applied by the {rh-rhacm} assisted service when it installs clusters using the `SiteConfig` CRs that you configure.

.Cluster installation CRs generated by {rh-rhacm}
[cols="1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
|CR |Description |Usage

|`BareMetalHost`
|Contains the connection information for the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) of the target bare-metal host.
|Provides access to the BMC to load and start the discovery image on the target server by using the Redfish protocol.

|`InfraEnv`
|Contains information for installing {product-title} on the target bare-metal host.
|Used with `ClusterDeployment` to generate the discovery ISO for the managed cluster.

|`AgentClusterInstall`
|Specifies details of the managed cluster configuration such as networking and the number of control plane nodes. Displays the cluster `kubeconfig` and credentials when the installation is complete.
|Specifies the managed cluster configuration information and provides status during the installation of the cluster.

|`ClusterDeployment`
|References the `AgentClusterInstall` CR to use.
|Used with `InfraEnv` to generate the discovery ISO for the managed cluster.

|`NMStateConfig`
|Provides network configuration information such as `MAC` address to `IP` mapping, DNS server, default route, and other network settings.
|Sets up a static IP address for the managed cluster’s Kube API server.

|`Agent`
|Contains hardware information about the target bare-metal host.
|Created automatically on the hub when the target machine's discovery image boots.

|`ManagedCluster`
|When a cluster is managed by the hub, it must be imported and known. This Kubernetes object provides that interface.
|The hub uses this resource to manage and show the status of managed clusters.

|`KlusterletAddonConfig`
|Contains the list of services provided by the hub to be deployed to the `ManagedCluster` resource.
|Tells the hub which addon services to deploy to the `ManagedCluster` resource.

|`Namespace`
|Logical space for `ManagedCluster` resources existing on the hub. Unique per site.
|Propagates resources to the `ManagedCluster`.

| `Secret`
|Two CRs are created: `BMC Secret` and `Image Pull Secret`.
a| * `BMC Secret` authenticates into the target bare-metal host using its username and password.
* `Image Pull Secret` contains authentication information for the {product-title} image installed on the target bare-metal host.

|`ClusterImageSet`
|Contains {product-title} image information such as the repository and image name.
|Passed into resources to provide {product-title} images.

[id="ztp-low-latency_{context}"]
= Running low latency applications on {product-title}

{product-title} enables low latency processing for applications running on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware by using several technologies and specialized hardware devices:

Real-time kernel for RHCOS:: Ensures workloads are handled with a high degree of process determinism.

CPU isolation:: Avoids CPU scheduling delays and ensures CPU capacity is available consistently.

NUMA-aware topology management:: Aligns memory and huge pages with CPU and PCI devices to pin guaranteed container memory and huge pages to the non-uniform memory access (NUMA) node. Pod resources for all Quality of Service (QoS) classes stay on the same NUMA node. This decreases latency and improves performance of the node.

Huge pages memory management:: Using huge page sizes improves system performance by reducing the amount of system resources required to access page tables.

Precision timing synchronization using PTP:: Allows synchronization between nodes in the network with sub-microsecond accuracy.

= Connectivity prerequisites for managed cluster networks

Before you can install and provision a managed cluster with the {ztp-first} pipeline, the managed cluster host must meet the following networking prerequisites:

* There must be bi-directional connectivity between the {ztp} container in the hub cluster and the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) of the target bare-metal host.

* The managed cluster must be able to resolve and reach the API hostname of the hub hostname and `{asterisk}.apps` hostname. Here is an example of the API hostname of the hub and `{asterisk}.apps` hostname:

** `api.hub-cluster.internal.domain.com`
** `console-openshift-console.apps.hub-cluster.internal.domain.com`

* The hub cluster must be able to resolve and reach the API and `{asterisk}.apps` hostname of the managed cluster. Here is an example of the API hostname of the managed cluster and `{asterisk}.apps` hostname:

** `api.sno-managed-cluster-1.internal.domain.com`
** `console-openshift-console.apps.sno-managed-cluster-1.internal.domain.com`

[id="ztp-workload-partitioning-sno_{context}"]
= Workload partitioning in {sno} with {ztp}

Workload partitioning configures {product-title} services, cluster management workloads, and infrastructure pods to run on a reserved number of host CPUs.

To configure workload partitioning with {ztp-first}, you configure a `cpuPartitioningMode` field in the `SiteConfig` custom resource (CR) that you use to install the cluster and you apply a `PerformanceProfile` CR that configures the `isolated` and `reserved` CPUs on the host.

Configuring the `SiteConfig` CR enables workload partitioning at cluster installation time and applying the `PerformanceProfile` CR configures the specific allocation of CPUs to reserved and isolated sets.
Both of these steps happen at different points during cluster provisioning.

[NOTE]
====
Configuring workload partitioning by using the `cpuPartitioningMode` field in the `SiteConfig` CR is a Tech Preview feature in {product-title} 4.13.

Alternatively, you can specify cluster management CPU resources with the `cpuset` field of the `SiteConfig` custom resource (CR) and the `reserved` field of the group `PolicyGenTemplate` CR.
The {ztp} pipeline uses these values to populate the required fields in the workload partitioning `MachineConfig` CR (`cpuset`) and the `PerformanceProfile` CR (`reserved`) that configure the {sno} cluster.
This method is a General Availability feature in {product-title} 4.14.
====

The workload partitioning configuration pins the {product-title} infrastructure pods to the `reserved` CPU set.
Platform services such as systemd, CRI-O, and kubelet run on the `reserved` CPU set.
The `isolated` CPU sets are exclusively allocated to your container workloads.
Isolating CPUs ensures that the workload has guaranteed access to the specified CPUs without contention from other applications running on the same node.
All CPUs that are not isolated should be reserved.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that `reserved` and `isolated` CPU sets do not overlap with each other.
====

When using the {ztp} plugin and `SiteConfig` CRs for cluster deployment, the following `MachineConfig` CRs are included by default.
====

Use the `SiteConfig` `extraManifests` filter to alter the CRs that are included by default. For more information, see xref:../../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-advanced-install-ztp.adoc#ztp-advanced-install-ztp[Advanced managed cluster configuration with SiteConfig CRs].

[id="ztp-sno-du-enabling-workload-partitioning_{context}"]
= Workload partitioning

{sno-caps} clusters that run DU workloads require workload partitioning. This limits the cores allowed to run platform services, maximizing the CPU core for application payloads.

[NOTE]
====
Workload partitioning can be enabled during cluster installation only.
You cannot disable workload partitioning postinstallation.
You can however change the set of CPUs assigned to the isolated and reserved sets through the `PerformanceProfile` CR.
Changes to CPU settings cause the node to reboot.
====

.Upgrading from {product-title} 4.12 to 4.13+
[NOTE]
====
When transitioning to using `cpuPartitioningMode` for enabling workload partitioning, remove the workload partitioning `MachineConfig` CRs from the `/extra-manifest` folder that you use to provision the cluster.

= Setting rcu_normal

The following `MachineConfig` CR configures the system to set `rcu_normal` to 1 after the system has finished startup. This improves kernel latency for vDU applications.

.Recommended configuration for disabling `rcu_expedited` after the node has finished startup (`08-set-rcu-normal-master.yaml`)

= Disable automatic CRI-O cache wipe

After an uncontrolled host shutdown or cluster reboot, CRI-O automatically deletes the entire CRI-O cache, causing all images to be pulled from the registry when the node reboots.
This can result in unacceptably slow recovery times or recovery failures.
To prevent this from happening in {sno} clusters that you install with {ztp}, disable the CRI-O delete cache feature during cluster installation.

= Configuring crun as the default container runtime

The following `ContainerRuntimeConfig` custom resources (CRs) configure crun as the default OCI container runtime for control plane and worker nodes.
The crun container runtime is fast and lightweight and has a low memory footprint.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For optimal performance, enable crun for control plane and worker nodes in {sno}, {3no}, and standard clusters.
To avoid the cluster rebooting when the CR is applied, apply the change as a {ztp} additional Day 0 install-time manifest.

== Recommended postinstallation cluster configurations

When the cluster installation is complete, the ZTP pipeline applies the following custom resources (CRs) that are required to run DU workloads.

[NOTE]
====
In {ztp} v4.10 and earlier, you configure UEFI secure boot with a `MachineConfig` CR. This is no longer required in {ztp} v4.11 and later. In v4.11, you configure UEFI secure boot for {sno} clusters by updating the `spec.clusters.nodes.bootMode` field in the `SiteConfig` CR that you use to install the cluster. For more information, see xref:../../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites.adoc#ztp-deploying-a-site_ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites[Deploying a managed cluster with SiteConfig and {ztp}].

= Operators

{sno-caps} clusters that run DU workloads require the following Operators to be installed:

* Local Storage Operator
* Logging Operator
* PTP Operator
* SR-IOV Network Operator

You also need to configure a custom `CatalogSource` CR, disable the default `OperatorHub` configuration, and configure an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` mirror registry that is accessible from the clusters that you install.

.Recommended Storage Operator namespace and Operator group configuration (`StorageNS.yaml`, `StorageOperGroup.yaml`)

= Operator subscriptions

{sno-caps} clusters that run DU workloads require the following `Subscription` CRs. The subscription provides the location to download the following Operators:

* Local Storage Operator
* Logging Operator
* PTP Operator
* SR-IOV Network Operator
* SRIOV-FEC Operator

For each Operator subscription, specify the channel to get the Operator from. The recommended channel is `stable`.

You can specify `Manual` or `Automatic` updates.
In `Automatic` mode, the Operator automatically updates to the latest versions in the channel as they become available in the registry.
In `Manual` mode, new Operator versions are installed only when they are explicitly approved.

[TIP]
====
Use `Manual` mode for subscriptions. This allows you to control the timing of Operator updates to fit within scheduled maintenance windows.

.PerformanceProfile CR options for {sno} clusters
[cols=2*, width="90%", options="header"]
|====
|PerformanceProfile CR field
|Description

|`metadata.name`
a|Ensure that `name` matches the following fields set in related {ztp} custom resources (CRs):

* `include=openshift-node-performance-${PerformanceProfile.metadata.name}` in `TunedPerformancePatch.yaml`
* `name: 50-performance-${PerformanceProfile.metadata.name}` in `validatorCRs/informDuValidator.yaml`

|`spec.additionalKernelArgs`
|`"efi=runtime"` Configures UEFI secure boot for the cluster host.

|`spec.cpu.isolated`
a|Set the isolated CPUs. Ensure all of the Hyper-Threading pairs match.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The reserved and isolated CPU pools must not overlap and together must span all available cores. CPU cores that are not accounted for cause an undefined behaviour in the system.
====

|`spec.cpu.reserved`
|Set the reserved CPUs. When workload partitioning is enabled, system processes, kernel threads, and system container threads are restricted to these CPUs. All CPUs that are not isolated should be reserved.

|`spec.hugepages.pages`
a|* Set the number of huge pages (`count`)
* Set the huge pages size (`size`).
* Set `node` to the NUMA node where the `hugepages` are allocated (`node`)

|`spec.realTimeKernel`
|Set `enabled` to `true` to use the realtime kernel.

|`spec.workloadHints`
|Use `workloadHints` to define the set of top level flags for different type of workloads.
The example configuration configures the cluster for low latency and high performance.

= Recommended firmware configuration for vDU cluster hosts

Use the following table as the basis to configure the cluster host firmware for vDU applications running on {product-title} {product-version}.

[NOTE]
====
The following table is a general recommendation for vDU cluster host firmware configuration. Exact firmware settings will depend on your requirements and specific hardware platform. Automatic setting of firmware is not handled by the zero touch provisioning pipeline.
====

.Recommended cluster host firmware settings
[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|====
|Firmware setting
|Configuration
|Description

|HyperTransport (HT)
|Enabled
|HyperTransport (HT) bus is a bus technology developed by AMD. HT provides a high-speed link between the components in the host memory and other system peripherals.

|UEFI
|Enabled
|Enable booting from UEFI for the vDU host.

|CPU Power and Performance Policy
|Performance
|Set CPU Power and Performance Policy to optimize the system for performance over energy efficiency.

|Uncore Frequency Scaling
|Disabled
|Disable Uncore Frequency Scaling to prevent the voltage and frequency of non-core parts of the CPU from being set independently.

|Uncore Frequency
|Maximum
|Sets the non-core parts of the CPU such as cache and memory controller to their maximum possible frequency of operation.

|Performance P-limit
|Disabled
|Disable Performance P-limit to prevent the Uncore frequency coordination of processors.

|Enhanced Intel(R) SpeedStep Tech
|Enabled
|Enable Enhanced Intel SpeedStep to allow the system to dynamically adjust processor voltage and core frequency that decreases power consumption and heat production in the host.

|Intel(R) Turbo Boost Technology
|Enabled
|Enable Turbo Boost Technology for Intel-based CPUs to automatically allow processor cores to run faster than the rated operating frequency if they are operating below power, current, and temperature specification limits.

|Intel Configurable TDP
|Enabled
|Enables Thermal Design Power (TDP) for the CPU.

|Configurable TDP Level
|Level 2
|TDP level sets the CPU power consumption required for a particular performance rating. TDP level 2 sets the CPU to the most stable performance level at the cost of power consumption.

|Energy Efficient Turbo
|Disabled
|Disable Energy Efficient Turbo to prevent the processor from using an energy-efficiency based policy.

|Hardware P-States
|Enabled or Disabled
|Enable OS-controlled P-States to allow power saving configurations. Disable `P-states` (performance states) to optimize the operating system and CPU for performance over power consumption.

|Package C-State
|C0/C1 state
|Use C0 or C1 states to set the processor to a fully active state (C0) or to stop CPU internal clocks running in software (C1).

|C1E
|Disabled
|CPU Enhanced Halt (C1E) is a power saving feature in Intel chips. Disabling C1E prevents the operating system from sending a halt command to the CPU when inactive.

|Processor C6
|Disabled
|C6 power-saving is a CPU feature that automatically disables idle CPU cores and cache. Disabling C6 improves system performance.

|Sub-NUMA Clustering
|Disabled
|Sub-NUMA clustering divides the processor cores, cache, and memory into multiple NUMA domains. Disabling this option can increase performance for latency-sensitive workloads.
|====

[NOTE]
====
Enable global SR-IOV and VT-d settings in the firmware for the host. These settings are relevant to bare-metal environments.
====

[NOTE]
====
Enable both `C-states` and OS-controlled `P-States` to allow per pod power management.

= Checking the realtime kernel version

Always use the latest version of the realtime kernel in your {product-title} clusters. If you are unsure about the kernel version that is in use in the cluster, you can compare the current realtime kernel version to the release version with the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You are logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have installed `podman`.

.Procedure

. Run the following command to get the cluster version:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ OCP_VERSION=$(oc get clusterversion version -o jsonpath='{.status.desired.version}{"\n"}')
----

. Get the release image SHA number:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ DTK_IMAGE=$(oc adm release info --image-for=driver-toolkit quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:$OCP_VERSION-x86_64)
----

. Run the release image container and extract the kernel version that is packaged with cluster's current release:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run --rm $DTK_IMAGE rpm -qa | grep 'kernel-rt-core-' | sed 's#kernel-rt-core-##'
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
4.18.0-305.49.1.rt7.121.el8_4.x86_64

[id="ztp-checking-du-cluster-config_{context}"]
= Checking that the recommended cluster configurations are applied

You can check that clusters are running the correct configuration. The following procedure describes how to check the various configurations that you require to deploy a DU application in {product-title} {product-version} clusters.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed a cluster and tuned it for vDU workloads.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Check that the default OperatorHub sources are disabled. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get operatorhub cluster -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
    disableAllDefaultSources: true
----

. Check that all required `CatalogSource` resources are annotated for workload partitioning (`PreferredDuringScheduling`) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get catalogsource -A -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{" -- "}{.metadata.annotations.target\.workload\.openshift\.io/management}{"\n"}{end}'

You can use `SiteConfig` custom resources (CRs) to deploy custom functionality and configurations in your managed clusters at installation time.

:leveloffset: +1

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-advanced-install-ztp.adoc

:_module-type: PROCEDURE
[id="ztp-customizing-the-install-extra-manifests_{context}"]
= Customizing extra installation manifests in the {ztp} pipeline

You can define a set of extra manifests for inclusion in the installation phase of the {ztp-first} pipeline. These manifests are linked to the `SiteConfig` custom resources (CRs) and are applied to the cluster during installation. Including `MachineConfig` CRs at install time makes the installation process more efficient.

.Prerequisites

* Create a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data. The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for the Argo CD application.

.Procedure

. Create a set of extra manifest CRs that the {ztp} pipeline uses to customize the cluster installs.

. In your custom `/siteconfig` directory, create a subdirectory `/custom-manifest` for your extra manifests. The following example illustrates a sample `/siteconfig` with `/custom-manifest` folder:

The subdirectory names `/custom-manifest` and `/extra-manifest` used throughout are example names only. There is no requirement to use these names and no restriction on how you name these subdirectories.
In this example `/extra-manifest` refers to the Git subdirectory that stores the contents of `/extra-manifest` from the `ztp-site-generate` container.
====

. Add your custom extra manifest CRs to the `siteconfig/custom-manifest` directory.

. In your `SiteConfig` CR, enter the directory name in the `extraManifests.searchPaths` field, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
clusters:
- clusterName: "example-sno"
  networkType: "OVNKubernetes"
  extraManifests:
    searchPaths:
      - extra-manifest/ <1>
      - custom-manifest/ <2>
----
<1> Folder for manifests copied from the `ztp-site-generate` container.
<2> Folder for custom manifests.

. Save the `SiteConfig`, `/extra-manifest`, and `/custom-manifest` CRs, and push them to the site configuration repo.

During cluster provisioning, the {ztp} pipeline appends the CRs in the `/custom-manifest` directory to the default set of extra manifests stored in `extra-manifest/`.

[NOTE]
====
As of version 4.14 `extraManifestPath` is subject to a deprecation warning.

While `extraManifestPath` is still supported, we recommend that you use `extraManifests.searchPaths`.
If you define `extraManifests.searchPaths` in the `SiteConfig` file, the {ztp} pipeline does not fetch manifests from the `ztp-site-generate` container during site installation.

If you define both `extraManifestPath` and `extraManifests.searchPaths` in the `Siteconfig` CR, the setting defined for `extraManifests.searchPaths` takes precedence.

It is strongly recommended that you extract the contents of `/extra-manifest` from the `ztp-site-generate` container and push it to the GIT repository.

[id="ztp-filtering-ai-crs-using-siteconfig_{context}"]
= Filtering custom resources using SiteConfig filters

By using filters, you can easily customize `SiteConfig` custom resources (CRs) to include or exclude other CRs for use in the installation phase of the {ztp-first} pipeline.

You can specify an `inclusionDefault` value of `include` or `exclude` for the `SiteConfig` CR, along with a list of the specific `extraManifest` RAN CRs that you want to include or exclude. Setting `inclusionDefault` to `include` makes the {ztp} pipeline apply all the files in `/source-crs/extra-manifest` during installation. Setting `inclusionDefault` to `exclude` does the opposite.

You can exclude individual CRs from the `/source-crs/extra-manifest` folder that are otherwise included by default. The following example configures a custom {sno} `SiteConfig` CR to exclude the `/source-crs/extra-manifest/03-sctp-machine-config-worker.yaml` CR at installation time.

Some additional optional filtering scenarios are also described.

.Prerequisites

* You configured the hub cluster for generating the required installation and policy CRs.

* You created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data. The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for the Argo CD application.

.Procedure

. To prevent the {ztp} pipeline from applying the `03-sctp-machine-config-worker.yaml` CR file, apply the following YAML in the `SiteConfig` CR:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1
kind: SiteConfig
metadata:
  name: "site1-sno-du"
  namespace: "site1-sno-du"
spec:
  baseDomain: "example.com"
  pullSecretRef:
    name: "assisted-deployment-pull-secret"
  clusterImageSetNameRef: "openshift-{product-version}"
  sshPublicKey: "<ssh_public_key>"
  clusters:
- clusterName: "site1-sno-du"
  extraManifests:
    filter:
      exclude:
        - 03-sctp-machine-config-worker.yaml
----
+
The {ztp} pipeline skips the `03-sctp-machine-config-worker.yaml` CR during installation. All other CRs in `/source-crs/extra-manifest` are applied.

. Save the `SiteConfig` CR and push the changes to the site configuration repository.
+
The {ztp} pipeline monitors and adjusts what CRs it applies based on the `SiteConfig` filter instructions.

. Optional: To prevent the {ztp} pipeline from applying all the `/source-crs/extra-manifest` CRs during cluster installation, apply the following YAML in the `SiteConfig` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- clusterName: "site1-sno-du"
  extraManifests:
    filter:
      inclusionDefault: exclude
----

. Optional: To exclude all the `/source-crs/extra-manifest` RAN CRs and instead include a custom CR file during installation, edit the custom `SiteConfig` CR to set the custom manifests folder and the `include` file, for example:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
clusters:
- clusterName: "site1-sno-du"
  extraManifestPath: "<custom_manifest_folder>" <1>
  extraManifests:
    filter:
      inclusionDefault: exclude  <2>
      include:
        - custom-sctp-machine-config-worker.yaml
----
<1> Replace `<custom_manifest_folder>` with the name of the folder that contains the custom installation CRs, for example, `user-custom-manifest/`.
<2> Set `inclusionDefault` to `exclude` to prevent the {ztp} pipeline from applying the files in `/source-crs/extra-manifest` during installation.
+
The following example illustrates the custom folder structure:
+
[source,text]
----
siteconfig
  ├── site1-sno-du.yaml
  └── user-custom-manifest
        └── custom-sctp-machine-config-worker.yaml

= Deploying additional changes to clusters

If you require cluster configuration changes outside of the base {ztp-first} pipeline configuration, there are three options:

Apply the additional configuration after the {ztp} pipeline is complete:: When the {ztp} pipeline deployment is complete, the deployed cluster is ready for application workloads. At this point, you can install additional Operators and apply configurations specific to your requirements. Ensure that additional configurations do not negatively affect the performance of the platform or allocated CPU budget.

Add content to the {ztp} library:: The base source custom resources (CRs) that you deploy with the {ztp} pipeline can be augmented with custom content as required.

Create extra manifests for the cluster installation:: Extra manifests are applied during installation and make the installation process more efficient.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Providing additional source CRs or modifying existing source CRs can significantly impact the performance or CPU profile of {product-title}.

:_module-type: PROCEDURE
[id="ztp-using-pgt-to-update-source-crs_{context}"]
= Using PolicyGenTemplate CRs to override source CRs content

`PolicyGenTemplate` custom resources (CRs) allow you to overlay additional configuration details on top of the base source CRs provided with the GitOps plugin in the `ztp-site-generate` container. You can think of `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs as a logical merge or patch to the base CR. Use `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs to update a single field of the base CR, or overlay the entire contents of the base CR. You can update values and insert fields that are not in the base CR.

The following example procedure describes how to update fields in the generated `PerformanceProfile` CR for the reference configuration based on the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR in the `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` file. Use the procedure as a basis for modifying other parts of the `PolicyGenTemplate` based on your requirements.

.Prerequisites

* Create a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data. The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for Argo CD.

.Procedure

. Review the baseline source CR for existing content. You can review the source CRs listed in the reference `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs by extracting them from the {ztp-first} container.

.. Create an `/out` folder:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir -p ./out
----

.. Extract the source CRs:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run --log-driver=none --rm registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ztp-site-generate-rhel8:v{product-version}.1 extract /home/ztp --tar | tar x -C ./out
----

. Review the baseline `PerformanceProfile` CR in `./out/source-crs/PerformanceProfile.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
metadata:
  name: $name
  annotations:
    ran.openshift.io/ztp-deploy-wave: "10"

  additionalKernelArgs:
  - "idle=poll"
  - "rcupdate.rcu_normal_after_boot=0"
  cpu:
    isolated: $isolated
    reserved: $reserved
  hugepages:
    defaultHugepagesSize: $defaultHugepagesSize
    pages:

  numa:
    topologyPolicy: "restricted"
  realTimeKernel:
    enabled: true
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Any fields in the source CR which contain `$...` are removed from the generated CR if they are not provided in the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR.
====

. Update the `PolicyGenTemplate` entry for `PerformanceProfile` in the `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` reference file. The following example `PolicyGenTemplate` CR stanza supplies appropriate CPU specifications, sets the `hugepages` configuration, and adds a new field that sets `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` to false.
+
[source,yaml]
----
- fileName: PerformanceProfile.yaml
  policyName: "config-policy"
  metadata:
    name: openshift-node-performance-profile
  spec:
    cpu:
      # These must be tailored for the specific hardware platform
      isolated: "2-19,22-39"
      reserved: "0-1,20-21"
    hugepages:
      defaultHugepagesSize: 1G
      pages:
        - size: 1G
          count: 10
    globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing: false
----

. Commit the `PolicyGenTemplate` change in Git, and then push to the Git repository being monitored by the {ztp} argo CD application.


.Example output

The {ztp} application generates an {rh-rhacm} policy that contains the generated `PerformanceProfile` CR. The contents of that CR are derived by merging the `metadata` and `spec` contents from the `PerformanceProfile` entry in the `PolicyGenTemplate` onto the source CR. The resulting CR has the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
metadata:
    name: openshift-node-performance-profile
spec:

        isolated: 2-19,22-39
        reserved: 0-1,20-21
    globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing: false
    hugepages:
        defaultHugepagesSize: 1G
        pages:
            - count: 10
              size: 1G

        node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ""
    numa:
        topologyPolicy: restricted
    realTimeKernel:
        enabled: true
----

[NOTE]
====
In the `/source-crs` folder that you extract from the `ztp-site-generate` container,  the `$` syntax is not used for template substitution as implied by the syntax. Rather, if the `policyGen` tool sees the `$` prefix for a string and you do not specify a value for that field in the related `PolicyGenTemplate` CR, the field is omitted from the output CR entirely.

An exception to this is the `$mcp` variable in `/source-crs` YAML files that is substituted with the specified value for `mcp` from the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR. For example, in `example/policygentemplates/group-du-standard-ranGen.yaml`, the value for `mcp` is `worker`:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  bindingRules:
    group-du-standard: ""
  mcp: "worker"
----

The `policyGen` tool replace instances of `$mcp` with `worker` in the output CRs.

[id="ztp-adding-new-content-to-gitops-ztp_{context}"]
= Adding custom content to the {ztp} pipeline

Perform the following procedure to add new content to the {ztp} pipeline.

.Procedure

. Create a subdirectory named `source-crs` in the directory that contains the `kustomization.yaml` file for the `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resource (CR).

. Add your user-provided CRs to the `source-crs` subdirectory, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,text]
----
example
└── policygentemplates
    ├── dev.yaml
    ├── kustomization.yaml
    ├── mec-edge-sno1.yaml
    ├── sno.yaml

        ├── PaoCatalogSource.yaml
        ├── PaoSubscription.yaml

            ├── ElasticsearchNS.yaml
            └── ElasticsearchOperatorGroup.yaml
----
<1> The `source-crs` subdirectory must be in the same directory as the `kustomization.yaml` file.

. Update the required `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs to include references to the content you added in the `source-crs/custom-crs` and `source-crs/elasticsearch` directories. For example:

= Configuring policy compliance evaluation timeouts for PolicyGenTemplate CRs

Use {rh-rhacm-first} installed on a hub cluster to monitor and report on whether your managed clusters are compliant with applied policies. {rh-rhacm} uses policy templates to apply predefined policy controllers and policies. Policy controllers are Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) instances.

You can override the default policy evaluation intervals with `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resources (CRs). You configure duration settings that define how long a `ConfigurationPolicy` CR can be in a state of policy compliance or non-compliance before {rh-rhacm} re-evaluates the applied cluster policies.

The {ztp-first} policy generator generates `ConfigurationPolicy` CR policies with pre-defined policy evaluation intervals. The default value for the `noncompliant` state is 10 seconds. The default value for the `compliant` state is 10 minutes. To disable the evaluation interval, set the value to `never`.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.

.Procedure

. To configure the evaluation interval for all policies in a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR, add `evaluationInterval` to the `spec` field, and then set the appropriate `compliant` and `noncompliant` values. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  evaluationInterval:
    compliant: 30m
    noncompliant: 20s
----

. To configure the evaluation interval for the `spec.sourceFiles` object in a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR, add `evaluationInterval` to the `sourceFiles` field, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  sourceFiles:
   - fileName: SriovSubscription.yaml
     policyName: "sriov-sub-policy"
     evaluationInterval:
       compliant: never
       noncompliant: 10s
----

. Commit the `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs files in the Git repository and push your changes.

.Verification

Check that the managed spoke cluster policies are monitored at the expected intervals.

. Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges on the managed cluster.

. Get the pods that are running in the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespace. Run the following command:

[id="ztp-using-pgt-to-configure-power-saving-states_{context}"]
= Configuring power states using PolicyGenTemplates CRs

For low latency and high-performance edge deployments, it is necessary to disable or limit C-states and P-states.
With this configuration, the CPU runs at a constant frequency, which is typically the maximum turbo frequency. This ensures that the CPU is always running at its maximum speed, which results in high performance and low latency.
This leads to the best latency for workloads.
However, this also leads to the highest power consumption, which might not be necessary for all workloads.

Workloads can be classified as critical or non-critical, with critical workloads requiring disabled C-state and P-state settings for high performance and low latency, while non-critical workloads use C-state and P-state settings for power savings at the expense of some latency and performance. You can configure the following three power states using {ztp-first}:

* High-performance mode provides ultra low latency at the highest power consumption.
* Performance mode provides low latency at a relatively high power consumption.
* Power saving balances reduced power consumption with increased latency.

The default configuration is for a low latency, performance mode.

`PolicyGenTemplate` custom resources (CRs) allow you to overlay additional configuration details onto the base source CRs provided with the GitOps plugin in the `ztp-site-generate` container.

Configure the power states by updating the `workloadHints` fields in the generated `PerformanceProfile` CR for the reference configuration, based on the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR in the `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml`.

The following common prerequisites apply to configuring all three power states.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data. The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for Argo CD.

* You have followed the procedure described in "Preparing the {ztp} site configuration repository".

[id="ztp-using-pgt-to-maximize-power-savings-mode_{context}"]
= Maximizing power savings

Limiting the maximum CPU frequency is recommended to achieve maximum power savings.
Enabling C-states on the non-critical workload CPUs without restricting the maximum CPU frequency negates much of the power savings by boosting the frequency of the critical CPUs.

Maximize power savings by updating the `sysfs` plugin fields, setting an appropriate value for `max_perf_pct` in the `TunedPerformancePatch` CR for the reference configuration. This example based on the `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` describes the procedure to follow to restrict the maximum CPU frequency.

.Prerequisites

* You have configured power savings mode as described in "Using PolicyGenTemplate CRs to configure power savings mode".

.Procedure

. Update the `PolicyGenTemplate` entry for `TunedPerformancePatch` in the `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` reference file in `out/argocd/example/policygentemplates`. To maximize power savings, add `max_perf_pct` as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- fileName: TunedPerformancePatch.yaml
      policyName: "config-policy"
      spec:
        profile:
          - name: performance-patch
            data: |
              [...]
              [sysfs]
              /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct=<x> <1>
----
+
<1> 	The `max_perf_pct` controls the maximum frequency the `cpufreq` driver is allowed to set as a percentage of the maximum supported CPU frequency. This value applies to all CPUs. You can check the maximum supported frequency in `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq`. As a starting point, you can use a percentage that caps all CPUs at the `All Cores Turbo` frequency. The `All Cores Turbo` frequency is the frequency that all cores will run at when the cores are all fully occupied.
+
[NOTE]
====
To maximize power savings, set a lower value. Setting a lower value for `max_perf_pct` limits the maximum CPU frequency, thereby reducing power consumption, but also potentially impacting performance. Experiment with different values and monitor the system's performance and power consumption to find the optimal setting for your use-case.
====

. Commit the `PolicyGenTemplate` change in Git, and then push to the Git repository being monitored by the {ztp} Argo CD application.

You can configure PTP events that use HTTP transport on managed clusters that you deploy with the {ztp-first} pipeline.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.

.Procedure

. Apply the following `PolicyGenTemplate` changes to `group-du-3node-ranGen.yaml`, `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml`, or `group-du-standard-ranGen.yaml` files according to your requirements:

.. In `.sourceFiles`, add the `PtpOperatorConfig` CR file that configures the transport host:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- fileName: PtpOperatorConfigForEvent.yaml
  policyName: "config-policy"
  spec:
    daemonNodeSelector: {}
    ptpEventConfig:

----
+
[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} 4.13 or later, you do not need to set the `transportHost` field in the `PtpOperatorConfig` resource when you use HTTP transport with PTP events.
====

.. Configure the `linuxptp` and `phc2sys` for the PTP clock type and interface. For example, add the following stanza into `.sourceFiles`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- fileName: PtpConfigSlave.yaml <1>
  policyName: "config-policy"
  metadata:
    name: "du-ptp-slave"

    ptpClockThreshold: <5>
      holdOverTimeout: 30 #secs
      maxOffsetThreshold: 100  #nano secs
      minOffsetThreshold: -100 #nano secs
----
<1> Can be one of `PtpConfigMaster.yaml`, `PtpConfigSlave.yaml`, or `PtpConfigSlaveCvl.yaml` depending on your requirements. `PtpConfigSlaveCvl.yaml` configures `linuxptp` services for an Intel E810 Columbiaville NIC. For configurations based on `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` or `group-du-3node-ranGen.yaml`, use `PtpConfigSlave.yaml`.
<2> Device specific interface name.
<3> You must append the `--summary_interval -4` value to `ptp4lOpts` in `.spec.sourceFiles.spec.profile` to enable PTP fast events.
<4> Required `phc2sysOpts` values. `-m` prints messages to `stdout`. The `linuxptp-daemon` `DaemonSet` parses the logs and generates Prometheus metrics.
<5> Optional. If the `ptpClockThreshold` stanza is not present, default values are used for the `ptpClockThreshold` fields. The stanza shows default `ptpClockThreshold` values. The `ptpClockThreshold` values configure how long after the PTP master clock is disconnected before PTP events are triggered. `holdOverTimeout` is the time value in seconds before the PTP clock event state changes to `FREERUN` when the PTP master clock is disconnected. The `maxOffsetThreshold` and `minOffsetThreshold` settings configure offset values in nanoseconds that compare against the values for `CLOCK_REALTIME` (`phc2sys`) or master offset (`ptp4l`). When the `ptp4l` or `phc2sys` offset value is outside this range, the PTP clock state is set to `FREERUN`. When the offset value is within this range, the PTP clock state is set to `LOCKED`.

. Merge any other required changes and files with your custom site repository.

. Push the changes to your site configuration repository to deploy PTP fast events to new sites using {ztp}.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.

.Procedure

. Add the following YAML into `.spec.sourceFiles` in the `common-ranGen.yaml` file to configure the AMQP Operator:
+
[source,yaml]
----
#AMQ interconnect operator for fast events
- fileName: AmqSubscriptionNS.yaml
  policyName: "subscriptions-policy"
- fileName: AmqSubscriptionOperGroup.yaml
  policyName: "subscriptions-policy"
- fileName: AmqSubscription.yaml
  policyName: "subscriptions-policy"
----

. Apply the following `PolicyGenTemplate` changes to `group-du-3node-ranGen.yaml`, `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml`, or `group-du-standard-ranGen.yaml` files according to your requirements:

.. In `.sourceFiles`, add the `PtpOperatorConfig` CR file that configures the AMQ transport host to the `config-policy`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- fileName: PtpOperatorConfigForEvent.yaml
  policyName: "config-policy"
  spec:
    daemonNodeSelector: {}
    ptpEventConfig:
      enableEventPublisher: true
      transportHost: "amqp://amq-router.amq-router.svc.cluster.local"
----

.. Configure the `linuxptp` and `phc2sys` for the PTP clock type and interface. For example, add the following stanza into `.sourceFiles`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- fileName: PtpConfigSlave.yaml <1>
  policyName: "config-policy"
  metadata:
    name: "du-ptp-slave"
  spec:
    profile:
    - name: "slave"
      interface: "ens5f1" <2>
      ptp4lOpts: "-2 -s --summary_interval -4" <3>
      phc2sysOpts: "-a -r -m -n 24 -N 8 -R 16" <4>
    ptpClockThreshold: <5>
      holdOverTimeout: 30 #secs
      maxOffsetThreshold: 100  #nano secs
      minOffsetThreshold: -100 #nano secs
----
<1> Can be one `PtpConfigMaster.yaml`, `PtpConfigSlave.yaml`, or `PtpConfigSlaveCvl.yaml` depending on your requirements. `PtpConfigSlaveCvl.yaml` configures `linuxptp` services for an Intel E810 Columbiaville NIC. For configurations based on `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` or `group-du-3node-ranGen.yaml`, use `PtpConfigSlave.yaml`.
<2> Device specific interface name.
<3> You must append the `--summary_interval -4` value to `ptp4lOpts` in `.spec.sourceFiles.spec.profile` to enable PTP fast events.
<4> Required `phc2sysOpts` values. `-m` prints messages to `stdout`. The `linuxptp-daemon` `DaemonSet` parses the logs and generates Prometheus metrics.
<5> Optional. If the `ptpClockThreshold` stanza is not present, default values are used for the `ptpClockThreshold` fields. The stanza shows default `ptpClockThreshold` values. The `ptpClockThreshold` values configure how long after the PTP master clock is disconnected before PTP events are triggered. `holdOverTimeout` is the time value in seconds before the PTP clock event state changes to `FREERUN` when the PTP master clock is disconnected. The `maxOffsetThreshold` and `minOffsetThreshold` settings configure offset values in nanoseconds that compare against the values for `CLOCK_REALTIME` (`phc2sys`) or master offset (`ptp4l`). When the `ptp4l` or `phc2sys` offset value is outside this range, the PTP clock state is set to `FREERUN`. When the offset value is within this range, the PTP clock state is set to `LOCKED`.

. Apply the following `PolicyGenTemplate` changes to your specific site YAML files, for example, `example-sno-site.yaml`:

.. In `.sourceFiles`, add the `Interconnect` CR file that configures the AMQ router to the `config-policy`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- fileName: AmqInstance.yaml
  policyName: "config-policy"
----

. Merge any other required changes and files with your custom site repository.

. Push the changes to your site configuration repository to deploy PTP fast events to new sites using {ztp}.

[id="ztp-add-local-reg-for-sno-duprofile_{context}"]
= Configuring the Image Registry Operator for local caching of images

{product-title} manages image caching using a local registry. In edge computing use cases, clusters are often subject to bandwidth restrictions when communicating with centralized image registries, which might result in long image download times.

Long download times are unavoidable during initial deployment. Over time, there is a risk that CRI-O will erase the `/var/lib/containers/storage` directory in the case of an unexpected shutdown.
To address long image download times, you can create a local image registry on remote managed clusters using {ztp-first}. This is useful in Edge computing scenarios where clusters are deployed at the far edge of the network.

Before you can set up the local image registry with {ztp}, you need to configure disk partitioning in the `SiteConfig` CR that you use to install the remote managed cluster. After installation, you configure the local image registry using a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR. Then, the {ztp} pipeline creates Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) CRs and patches the `imageregistry` configuration.

[NOTE]
====
The local image registry can only be used for user application images and cannot be used for the {product-title} or Operator Lifecycle Manager operator images.

:_module-type: PROCEDURE
[id="ztp-configuring-disk-partitioning_{context}"]
= Configuring disk partitioning with SiteConfig

Configure disk partitioning for a managed cluster using a `SiteConfig` CR and {ztp-first}. The  disk partition details in the `SiteConfig` CR must match the underlying disk.

[NOTE]
====
Use persistent naming for devices to avoid device names such as `/dev/sda` and `/dev/sdb` being switched at every reboot. You can use `rootDeviceHints` to choose the bootable device and then use same device for further partitioning.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data for use with {ztp-first}.

.Procedure

. Add the following YAML that describes the host disk partitioning to the `SiteConfig` CR that you use to install the managed cluster:
+
[source,yaml]
----
nodes:
    rootDeviceHints:
      wwn: "0x62cea7f05c98c2002708a0a22ff480ea"
    diskPartition:
      - device: /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x62cea7f05c98c2002708a0a22ff480ea <1>
        partitions:
          - mount_point: /var/imageregistry
            size: 102500 <2>
            start: 344844 <3>
----
<1> This setting depends on the hardware. The setting can be a serial number or device name. The value must match the value set for `rootDeviceHints`.
<2> The minimum value for `size` is 102500 MiB.
<3> The minimum value for `start` is 25000 MiB. The total value of `size` and `start` must not exceed the disk size, or the installation will fail.

. Save the `SiteConfig` CR and push it to the site configuration repo.

The {ztp} pipeline provisions the cluster using the `SiteConfig` CR and configures the disk partition.

= Configuring the image registry using PolicyGenTemplate CRs

Use `PolicyGenTemplate` (PGT) CRs to apply the CRs required to configure the image registry and patch the `imageregistry` configuration.

.Prerequisites

* You have configured a disk partition in the managed cluster.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data for use with {ztp-first}.

.Procedure

. Configure the storage class, persistent volume claim, persistent volume, and image registry configuration in the appropriate `PolicyGenTemplate` CR. For example, to configure an individual site, add the following YAML to the file `example-sno-site.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
sourceFiles:
  # storage class
  - fileName: StorageClass.yaml
    policyName: "sc-for-image-registry"

        pvc:
          claim: "image-registry-pvc"
----
<1> Set the appropriate value for `ztp-deploy-wave` depending on whether you are configuring image registries at the site, common, or group level. `ztp-deploy-wave: "100"` is suitable for development or testing because it allows you to group the referenced source files together.
<2> In `ImageRegistryPV.yaml`, ensure that the `spec.local.path` field is set to `/var/imageregistry` to match the value set for the `mount_point` field in the `SiteConfig` CR.

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not set `complianceType: mustonlyhave` for the `- fileName: ImageRegistryConfig.yaml` configuration. This can cause the registry pod deployment to fail.
====

. Commit the `PolicyGenTemplate` change in Git, and then push to the Git repository being monitored by the {ztp} ArgoCD application.

= Using hub templates in PolicyGenTemplate CRs

{cgu-operator-full} supports partial {rh-rhacm-first} hub cluster template functions in configuration policies used with {ztp-first}.

Hub-side cluster templates allow you to define configuration policies that can be dynamically customized to the target clusters.
This reduces the need to create separate policies for many clusters with similiar configurations but with different values.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Policy templates are restricted to the same namespace as the namespace where the policy is defined.
This means that you must create the objects referenced in the hub template in the same namespace where the policy is created.
====

The following supported hub template functions are available for use in {ztp} with {cgu-operator}:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.6/html-single/governance/index#fromConfigmap-func[`fromConfigmap`] returns the value of the provided data key in the named `ConfigMap` resource.
+
[NOTE]
====
There is a link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/#motivation[1 MiB size limit] for `ConfigMap` CRs.
The effective size for `ConfigMap` CRs is further limited by the `last-applied-configuration` annotation.
To avoid the `last-applied-configuration` limitation, add the following annotation to the template `ConfigMap`:

You can manage the configuration of fleets of clusters with `ConfigMap` CRs by using hub templates to populate the group and site values in the generated policies that get applied to the managed clusters.
Using hub templates in site `PolicyGenTemplate` (PGT) CRs means that you do not need to create a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR for each site.

You can group the clusters in a fleet in various categories, depending on the use case, for example hardware type or region.
Each cluster should have a label corresponding to the group or groups that the cluster is in.
If you manage the configuration values for each group in different `ConfigMap` CRs, then you require only one group `PolicyGenTemplate` CR to apply the changes to all the clusters in the group by using hub templates.

The following example shows you how to use three `ConfigMap` CRs and one group `PolicyGenTemplate` CR to apply both site and group configuration to clusters grouped by hardware type and region.

[NOTE]
====
When you use the `fromConfigmap` function, the `printf` variable is only available for the template resource `data` key fields. You cannot use it with `name` and `namespace` fields.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.
The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for the {ztp} ArgoCD application.

.Procedure

. Create three `ConfigMap` CRs that contain the group and site configuration:
+
--
.. Create  a `ConfigMap` CR named `group-hardware-types-configmap` to hold the hardware-specific configuration. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: group-hardware-types-configmap
  namespace: ztp-group
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Replace=true <1>
data:
  # SriovNetworkNodePolicy.yaml
  hardware-type-1-sriov-node-policy-pfNames-1: "[\"ens5f0\"]"
  hardware-type-1-sriov-node-policy-pfNames-2: "[\"ens7f0\"]"
  # PerformanceProfile.yaml
  hardware-type-1-cpu-isolated: "2-31,34-63"
  hardware-type-1-cpu-reserved: "0-1,32-33"
  hardware-type-1-hugepages-default: "1G"
  hardware-type-1-hugepages-size: "1G"
  hardware-type-1-hugepages-count: "32"
----
<1> The `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options` annotation is required only if the `ConfigMap` is larger than 1 MiB in size.

.. Create  a `ConfigMap` CR named `group-zones-configmap` to hold the regional configuration. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: group-zones-configmap
  namespace: ztp-group
data:
  # ClusterLogForwarder.yaml
  zone-1-cluster-log-fwd-outputs: "[{\"type\":\"kafka\", \"name\":\"kafka-open\", \"url\":\"tcp://10.46.55.190:9092/test\"}]"
  zone-1-cluster-log-fwd-pipelines: "[{\"inputRefs\":[\"audit\", \"infrastructure\"], \"labels\": {\"label1\": \"test1\", \"label2\": \"test2\", \"label3\": \"test3\", \"label4\": \"test4\"}, \"name\": \"all-to-default\", \"outputRefs\": [\"kafka-open\"]}]"
----

.. Create a `ConfigMap` CR named `site-data-configmap` to hold the site-specific configuration. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: site-data-configmap
  namespace: ztp-group
data:
  # SriovNetwork.yaml
  du-sno-1-zone-1-sriov-network-vlan-1: "140"
  du-sno-1-zone-1-sriov-network-vlan-2: "150"
----
--
+
[NOTE]
====
Each `ConfigMap` CR must be in the same namespace as the policy to be generated from the group `PolicyGenTemplate` CR.
====

. Commit the `ConfigMap` CRs in Git, and then push to the Git repository being monitored by the Argo CD application.

. Apply the hardware type and region labels to the clusters.
The following command applies to a single cluster named `du-sno-1-zone-1` and the labels chosen are `"hardware-type": "hardware-type-1"` and `"group-du-sno-zone": "zone-1"`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch managedclusters.cluster.open-cluster-management.io/du-sno-1-zone-1 --type merge -p '{"metadata":{"labels":{"hardware-type": "hardware-type-1", "group-du-sno-zone": "zone-1"}}}'
----

. Create a group `PolicyGenTemplate` CR that uses hub templates to obtain the required data from the `ConfigMap` objects.
This example `PolicyGenTemplate` CR configures logging, VLAN IDs, NICs and Performance Profile for the clusters that match the labels listed under `spec.bindingRules`:
+

[NOTE]
====
To retrieve site-specific configuration values, use the `.ManagedClusterName` field.
This is a template context value set to the name of the target managed cluster.

To retrieve group-specific configuration, use the `.ManagedClusterLabels` field.
This is a template context value set to the value of the managed cluster's labels.
====

. Commit the site `PolicyGenTemplate` CR in Git and push to the Git repository that is monitored by the ArgoCD application.
+
[NOTE]
====
Subsequent changes to the referenced `ConfigMap` CR are not automatically synced to the applied policies.
You need to manually sync the new `ConfigMap` changes to update existing `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs. See "Syncing new ConfigMap changes to existing PolicyGenTemplate CRs".

You can use the same `PolicyGenTemplate` CR for multiple clusters.
If there is a configuration change, then the only modifications you need to make are to the `ConfigMap` objects that hold the configuration for each cluster and the labels of the managed clusters.

[id="ztp-syncing-new-configmap-changes-to-existing-pgt-crs_{context}"]
= Syncing new ConfigMap changes to existing PolicyGenTemplate CRs

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have created a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR that pulls information from a `ConfigMap` CR using hub cluster templates.

.Procedure

. Update the contents of your `ConfigMap` CR, and apply the changes in the hub cluster.

. To sync the contents of the updated `ConfigMap` CR to the deployed policy, do either of the following:

.. Option 1: Delete the existing policy. ArgoCD uses the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR to immediately recreate the deleted policy. For example, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete policy <policy_name> -n <policy_namespace>
----

.. Option 2: Apply a special annotation `policy.open-cluster-management.io/trigger-update` to the policy with a different value every time when you update the `ConfigMap`. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate policy <policy_name> -n <policy_namespace> policy.open-cluster-management.io/trigger-update="1"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You must apply the updated policy for the changes to take effect. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.6/html-single/governance/index#special-annotation-processing[Special annotation for reprocessing].
====

. Optional: If it exists, delete the `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR that contains the policy. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete clustergroupupgrade <cgu_name> -n <cgu_namespace>
----

.. Create a new `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR that includes the policy to apply with the updated `ConfigMap` changes. For example, add the following YAML to the file `cgr-example.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: <cgr_name>
  namespace: <policy_namespace>
spec:
  managedPolicies:
    - <managed_policy>
  enable: true
  clusters:
  - <managed_cluster_1>
  - <managed_cluster_2>
  remediationStrategy:
    maxConcurrency: 2
    timeout: 240
----

.. Apply the updated policy:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f cgr-example.yaml

= About the {cgu-operator-full} configuration

The {cgu-operator-first} manages the deployment of {rh-rhacm-first} policies for one or more {product-title} clusters. Using {cgu-operator} in a large network of clusters allows the phased rollout of policies to the clusters in limited batches. This helps to minimize possible service disruptions when updating. With {cgu-operator}, you can control the following actions:

* The timing of the update
* The number of {rh-rhacm}-managed clusters
* The subset of managed clusters to apply the policies to
* The update order of the clusters
* The set of policies remediated to the cluster
* The order of policies remediated to the cluster
* The assignment of a canary cluster

For {sno}, the {cgu-operator-first} offers the following features:

* Create a backup of a deployment before an upgrade
* Pre-caching images for clusters with limited bandwidth

{cgu-operator} supports the orchestration of the {product-title} y-stream and z-stream updates, and day-two operations on y-streams and z-streams.

[id="cnf-about-topology-aware-lifecycle-manager-about-policies_{context}"]
= About managed policies used with {cgu-operator-full}

The {cgu-operator-first} uses {rh-rhacm} policies for cluster updates.

{cgu-operator} can be used to manage the rollout of any policy CR where the `remediationAction` field is set to `inform`.
Supported use cases include the following:

* Manual user creation of policy CRs
* Automatically generated policies from the `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resource definition (CRD)

For policies that update an Operator subscription with manual approval, {cgu-operator} provides additional functionality that approves the installation of the updated Operator.

For more information about managed policies, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/{rh-rhacm-version}/html-single/governance/index#policy-overview[Policy Overview] in the {rh-rhacm} documentation.

For more information about the `PolicyGenTemplate` CRD, see the "About the PolicyGenTemplate CRD" section in "Configuring managed clusters with policies and PolicyGenTemplate resources".

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="talo-about-cgu-crs_{context}"]
= About the ClusterGroupUpgrade CR

The {cgu-operator-first} builds the remediation plan from the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR for a group of clusters. You can define the following specifications in a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR:

* Clusters in the group
* Blocking `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CRs
* Applicable list of managed policies
* Number of concurrent updates
* Applicable canary updates
* Actions to perform before and after the update
* Update timing

You can control the start time of an update using the `enable` field in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.
For example, if you have a scheduled maintenance window of four hours, you can prepare a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the `enable` field set to `false`.

You can set the timeout by configuring the `spec.remediationStrategy.timeout` setting as follows:
[source,yaml]
----
spec
  remediationStrategy:
          maxConcurrency: 1
          timeout: 240
----

You can use the `batchTimeoutAction` to determine what happens if an update fails for a cluster.
You can specify `continue` to skip the failing cluster and continue to upgrade other clusters, or `abort` to stop policy remediation for all clusters.
Once the timeout elapses, {cgu-operator} removes all `enforce` policies to ensure that no further updates are made to clusters.

To apply the changes, you set the `enabled` field to `true`.

For more information see the "Applying update policies to managed clusters" section.

As {cgu-operator} works through remediation of the policies to the specified clusters, the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR can report true or false statuses for a number of conditions.

[NOTE]
====
After {cgu-operator} completes a cluster update, the cluster does not update again under the control of the same `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. You must create a new `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR in the following cases:

* When you need to update the cluster again
* When the cluster changes to non-compliant with the `inform` policy after being updated
====

[id="selecting_clusters_{context}"]
== Selecting clusters

{cgu-operator} builds a remediation plan and selects clusters based on the following fields:

* The `clusterLabelSelector` field specifies the labels of the clusters that you want to update. This consists of a list of the standard label selectors from `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1`. Each selector in the list uses either label value pairs or label expressions. Matches from each selector are added to the final list of clusters along with the matches from the `clusterSelector` field and the `cluster` field.
* The `clusters` field specifies a list of clusters to update.
* The `canaries` field specifies the clusters for canary updates.
* The `maxConcurrency` field specifies the number of clusters to update in a batch.
* The `actions` field specifies `beforeEnable` actions that {cgu-operator} takes as it begins the update process, and `afterCompletion` actions that {cgu-operator} takes as it completes policy remediation for each cluster.

You can use the `clusters`, `clusterLabelSelector`, and `clusterSelector` fields together to create a combined list of clusters.

The remediation plan starts with the clusters listed in the `canaries` field. Each canary cluster forms a single-cluster batch.

====

When the remediation plan is successfully created, you can you set the `enable` field to `true` and {cgu-operator} starts to update the non-compliant clusters with the specified managed policies.

[NOTE]
====
You can only make changes to the `spec` fields if the `enable` field of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR is set to `false`.
====

[id="validating_{context}"]
== Validating

{cgu-operator} checks that all specified managed policies are available and correct, and uses the `Validated` condition to report the status and reasons as follows:

* `true`
+
Validation is completed.
* `false`
+
Policies are missing or invalid, or an invalid platform image has been specified.

[id="precaching_{context}"]
== Pre-caching

Clusters might have limited bandwidth to access the container image registry, which can cause a timeout before the updates are completed. On {sno} clusters, you can use pre-caching to avoid this. The container image pre-caching starts when you create a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the `preCaching` field set to `true`.
{cgu-operator} compares the available disk space with the estimated {product-title} image size to ensure that there is enough space. If a cluster has insufficient space, {cgu-operator} cancels pre-caching for that cluster and does not remediate policies on it.

{cgu-operator} uses the `PrecacheSpecValid` condition to report status information as follows:

* `true`
+
The pre-caching spec is valid and consistent.
* `false`
+
The pre-caching spec is incomplete.

{cgu-operator} uses the `PrecachingSucceeded` condition to report status information as follows:

* `true`
+
TALM has concluded the pre-caching process. If pre-caching fails for any cluster, the update fails for that cluster but proceeds for all other clusters. A message informs you if pre-caching has failed for any clusters.
* `false`
+
Pre-caching is still in progress for one or more clusters or has failed for all clusters.

For more information see the "Using the container image pre-cache feature" section.

[id="creating_backup_{context}"]
== Creating a backup

For {sno}, {cgu-operator} can create a backup of a deployment before an update. If the update fails, you can recover the previous version and restore a cluster to a working state without requiring a reprovision of applications. To use the backup feature you first create a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the `backup` field set to `true`. To ensure that the contents of the backup are up to date, the backup is not taken until you set the `enable` field in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR to `true`.

{cgu-operator} uses the `BackupSucceeded` condition to report the status and reasons as follows:

* `true`
+
Backup is completed for all clusters or the backup run has completed but failed for one or more clusters. If backup fails for any cluster, the update fails for that cluster but proceeds for all other clusters.
* `false`
+
Backup is still in progress for one or more clusters or has failed for all clusters.

For more information, see the "Creating a backup of cluster resources before upgrade" section.

[id="updating_clusters_{context}"]
== Updating clusters
{cgu-operator} enforces the policies following the remediation plan.
Enforcing the policies for subsequent batches starts immediately after all the clusters of the current batch are compliant with all the managed policies. If the batch times out, {cgu-operator} moves on to the next batch. The timeout value of a batch is the `spec.timeout` field divided by the number of batches in the remediation plan.

{cgu-operator} uses the `Progressing` condition to report the status and reasons as follows:

* `true`
+
{cgu-operator} is remediating non-compliant policies.
* `false`
+
The update is not in progress. Possible reasons for this are:
+
** All clusters are compliant with all the managed policies.
** The update has timed out as policy remediation took too long.
** Blocking CRs are missing from the system or have not yet completed.
** The `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR is not enabled.
** Backup is still in progress.

[NOTE]
====
The managed policies apply in the order that they are listed in the `managedPolicies` field in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. One managed policy is applied to the specified clusters at a time. When a cluster complies with the current policy, the next managed policy is applied to it.
====

[id="cnf-about-topology-aware-lifecycle-manager-blocking-crs_{context}"]
= Blocking ClusterGroupUpgrade CRs

You can create multiple `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CRs and control their order of application.

For example, if you create `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR C that blocks the start of `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR A, then `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR A cannot start until the status of `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR C becomes `UpgradeComplete`.

One `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR can have multiple blocking CRs. In this case, all the blocking CRs must complete before the upgrade for the current CR can start.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {cgu-operator-first}.
* Provision one or more managed clusters.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Create {rh-rhacm} policies in the hub cluster.

.Procedure

. Save the content of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CRs in the `cgu-a.yaml`, `cgu-b.yaml`, and `cgu-c.yaml` files.

[id="talo-policies-concept_{context}"]
= Update policies on managed clusters

The {cgu-operator-first} remediates a set of `inform` policies for the clusters specified in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. {cgu-operator} remediates `inform` policies by making `enforce` copies of the managed {rh-rhacm} policies. Each copied policy has its own corresponding {rh-rhacm} placement rule and {rh-rhacm} placement binding.

One by one, {cgu-operator} adds each cluster from the current batch to the placement rule that corresponds with the applicable managed policy. If a cluster is already compliant with a policy, {cgu-operator} skips applying that policy on the compliant cluster. {cgu-operator} then moves on to applying the next policy to the non-compliant cluster. After {cgu-operator} completes the updates in a batch, all clusters are removed from the placement rules associated with the copied policies. Then, the update of the next batch starts.

If a spoke cluster does not report any compliant state to {rh-rhacm}, the managed policies on the hub cluster can be missing status information that {cgu-operator} needs. {cgu-operator} handles these cases in the following ways:

* If a policy's `status.compliant` field is missing, {cgu-operator} ignores the policy and adds a log entry. Then, {cgu-operator} continues looking at the policy's `status.status` field.
* If a policy's `status.status` is missing, {cgu-operator} produces an error.
* If a cluster's compliance status is missing in the policy's `status.status` field, {cgu-operator} considers that cluster to be non-compliant with that policy.

The `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR's `batchTimeoutAction` determines what happens if an upgrade fails for a cluster. You can specify `continue` to skip the failing cluster and continue to upgrade other clusters, or specify `abort` to stop the policy remediation for all clusters. Once the timeout elapses, {cgu-operator} removes all enforce policies to ensure that no further updates are made to clusters.

= Creating a backup of cluster resources before upgrade

For {sno}, the {cgu-operator-first} can create a backup of a deployment before an upgrade. If the upgrade fails, you can recover the previous version and restore a cluster to a working state without requiring a reprovision of applications.

To use the backup feature you first create a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the `backup` field set to `true`. To ensure that the contents of the backup are up to date, the backup is not taken until you set the `enable` field in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR to `true`.

{cgu-operator} uses the `BackupSucceeded` condition to report the status and reasons as follows:

* `true`
+
Backup is completed for all clusters or the backup run has completed but failed for one or more clusters. If backup fails for any cluster, the update does not proceed for that cluster.
* `false`
+
Backup is still in progress for one or more clusters or has failed for all clusters. The backup process running in the spoke clusters can have the following statuses:
+
** `PreparingToStart`
+
The first reconciliation pass is in progress. The {cgu-operator} deletes any spoke backup namespace and hub view resources that have been created in a failed upgrade attempt.
** `Starting`
+
The backup prerequisites and backup job are being created.
** `Active`
+
The backup is in progress.
** `Succeeded`
+
The backup succeeded.
** `BackupTimeout`
+
Artifact backup is partially done.
** `UnrecoverableError`
+
The backup has ended with a non-zero exit code.

[NOTE]
====
If the backup of a cluster fails and enters the `BackupTimeout` or `UnrecoverableError` state, the cluster update does not proceed for that cluster. Updates to other clusters are not affected and continue.

= Creating a ClusterGroupUpgrade CR with backup

You can create a backup of a deployment before an upgrade on {sno} clusters. If the upgrade fails you can use the `upgrade-recovery.sh` script generated by {cgu-operator-first} to return the system to its preupgrade state.
The backup consists of the following items:

Cluster backup:: A snapshot of `etcd` and static pod manifests.
Content backup:: Backups of folders, for example, `/etc`, `/usr/local`, `/var/lib/kubelet`.
Changed files backup:: Any files managed by `machine-config` that have been changed.
Deployment:: A pinned `ostree` deployment.
Images (Optional):: Any container images that are in use.


.Prerequisites

* Install the {cgu-operator-first}.
* Provision one or more managed clusters.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Install {rh-rhacm-first}.

[NOTE]
====
It is highly recommended that you create a recovery partition.

= Recovering a cluster after a failed upgrade

If an upgrade of a cluster fails, you can manually log in to the cluster and use the backup to return the cluster to its preupgrade state. There are two stages:

Rollback:: If the attempted upgrade included a change to the platform OS deployment, you must roll back to the previous version before running the recovery script.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A rollback is only applicable to upgrades from TALM and single-node OpenShift. This process does not apply to rollbacks from any other upgrade type.
====

Recovery:: The recovery shuts down containers and uses files from the backup partition to relaunch containers and restore clusters.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {cgu-operator-first}.
* Provision one or more managed clusters.
* Install {rh-rhacm-first}.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Run an upgrade that is configured for backup.

= Using the container image pre-cache feature

{sno-caps} clusters might have limited bandwidth to access the container image registry, which can cause a timeout before the updates are completed.

[NOTE]
====
The time of the update is not set by {cgu-operator}. You can apply the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR at the beginning of the update by manual application or by external automation.
====

The container image pre-caching starts when the `preCaching` field is set to `true` in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.

{cgu-operator} uses the `PrecacheSpecValid` condition to report status information as follows:

* `true`
+
The pre-caching spec is valid and consistent.
* `false`
+
The pre-caching spec is incomplete.

{cgu-operator} uses the `PrecachingSucceeded` condition to report status information as follows:

* `true`
+
{cgu-operator} has concluded the pre-caching process. If pre-caching fails for any cluster, the update fails for that cluster but proceeds for all other clusters. A message informs you if pre-caching has failed for any clusters.
* `false`
+
Pre-caching is still in progress for one or more clusters or has failed for all clusters.

After a successful pre-caching process, you can start remediating policies. The remediation actions start when the `enable` field is set to `true`. If there is a pre-caching failure on a cluster, the upgrade fails for that cluster. The upgrade process continues for all other clusters that have a successful pre-cache.

The pre-caching process can be in the following statuses:

* `NotStarted`
+
This is the initial state all clusters are automatically assigned to on the first reconciliation pass of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. In this state, {cgu-operator} deletes any pre-caching namespace and hub view resources of spoke clusters that remain from previous incomplete updates. {cgu-operator} then creates a new `ManagedClusterView` resource for the spoke pre-caching namespace to verify its deletion in the `PrecachePreparing` state.
* `PreparingToStart`
+
Cleaning up any remaining resources from previous incomplete updates is in progress.
* `Starting`
+
Pre-caching job prerequisites and the job are created.
* `Active`
+
The job is in "Active" state.
*  `Succeeded`
+
The pre-cache job succeeded.
* `PrecacheTimeout`
+
The artifact pre-caching is partially done.
* `UnrecoverableError`
+
The job ends with a non-zero exit code.

The pre-cache feature typically downloads more images than a cluster needs for an update. You can control which pre-cache images are downloaded to a cluster. This decreases download time, and saves bandwidth and storage.

You can see a list of all images to be downloaded using the following command:

= Creating a ClusterGroupUpgrade CR with pre-caching

For {sno}, the pre-cache feature allows the required container images to be present on the spoke cluster before the update starts.

[NOTE]
====
For pre-caching, {cgu-operator} uses the `spec.remediationStrategy.timeout` value from the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. You must set a `timeout` value that allows sufficient time for the pre-caching job to complete. When you enable the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR after pre-caching has completed, you can change the `timeout` value to a duration that is appropriate for the update.

= Troubleshooting the {cgu-operator-full}

The {cgu-operator-first} is an {product-title} Operator that remediates {rh-rhacm} policies. When issues occur, use the `oc adm must-gather` command to gather details and logs and to take steps in debugging the issues.


For more information about related topics, see the following documentation:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6218901[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes 2.4 Support Matrix]

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.0/html/troubleshooting/troubleshooting[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management Troubleshooting]

* The "Troubleshooting Operator issues" section

[id="talo-general-troubleshooting_{context}"]
== General troubleshooting

You can determine the cause of the problem by reviewing the following questions:

* Is the configuration that you are applying supported?
** Are the {rh-rhacm} and the {product-title} versions compatible?
** Are the {cgu-operator} and {rh-rhacm} versions compatible?
* Which of the following components is causing the problem?
** <<talo-troubleshooting-managed-policies_{context}>>
** <<talo-troubleshooting-clusters_{context}>>
** <<talo-troubleshooting-remediation-strategy_{context}>>
** <<talo-troubleshooting-remediation-talo_{context}>>

To ensure that the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` configuration is functional, you can do the following:

. Create the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the `spec.enable` field set to `false`.

. Wait for the status to be updated and go through the troubleshooting questions.

. If everything looks as expected, set the `spec.enable` field to `true` in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.

[WARNING]
====
After you set the `spec.enable` field to `true` in the `ClusterUpgradeGroup` CR, the update procedure starts and you cannot edit the CR's `spec` fields anymore.
====

[id="talo-troubleshooting-modify-cgu_{context}"]
== Cannot modify the ClusterUpgradeGroup CR

Issue:: You cannot edit the `ClusterUpgradeGroup` CR after enabling the update.

$ oc delete cgu -n <ClusterGroupUpgradeCR_namespace> <ClusterGroupUpgradeCR_name>
----
+
. Check and fix the existing issues with the managed clusters and policies.
.. Ensure that all the clusters are managed clusters and available.
.. Ensure that all the policies exist and have the `spec.remediationAction` field set to `inform`.
+
. Create a new `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the correct configurations.

=== Clusters are not compliant to some policies after a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR has completed

Issue:: The policy compliance status that {cgu-operator} uses to decide if remediation is needed has not yet fully updated for all clusters.
This may be because:
* The CGU was run too soon after a policy was created or updated.
* The remediation of a policy affects the compliance of subsequent policies in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.

Resolution:: Create and apply a new `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR with the same specification.

[discrete]
[id="talo-troubleshooting-auto-create-policies_{context}"]
=== Auto-created `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR in the {ztp} workflow has no managed policies

Issue:: If there are no policies for the managed cluster when the cluster becomes `Ready`, a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with no policies is auto-created.
Upon completion of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR, the managed cluster is labeled as `ztp-done`.
If the `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs were not pushed to the Git repository within the required time after `SiteConfig` resources were pushed, this might result in no policies being available for the target cluster when the cluster became `Ready`.

Resolution:: Verify that the policies you want to apply are available on the hub cluster, then create a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the required policies.

You can either manually create the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR or trigger auto-creation again. To trigger auto-creation of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR, remove the `ztp-done` label from the cluster and delete the empty `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR that was previously created in the `zip-install` namespace.

[discrete]
[id="talo-troubleshooting-pre-cache-failed_{context}"]
=== Pre-caching has failed

Issue:: Pre-caching might fail for one of the following reasons:
* There is not enough free space on the node.
* For a disconnected environment, the pre-cache image has not been properly mirrored.
* There was an issue when creating the pod.

Resolution::
. To check if pre-caching has failed due to insufficient space, check the log of the pre-caching pod in the node.
.. Find the name of the pod using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-talo-pre-cache
----
+
.. Check the logs to see if the error is related to insufficient space using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -n openshift-talo-pre-cache <pod name>
----
+
. If there is no log, check the pod status using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe pod -n openshift-talo-pre-cache <pod name>
----
+
. If the pod does not exist, check the job status to see why it could not create a pod using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe job -n openshift-talo-pre-cache pre-cache
----

= Updating clusters in a disconnected environment

You can upgrade managed clusters and Operators for managed clusters that you have deployed using {ztp-first} and {cgu-operator-first}.

[id="talo-platform-prepare-for-update-env-setup_{context}"]
== Setting up the environment

{cgu-operator} can perform both platform and Operator updates.

You must mirror both the platform image and Operator images that you want to update to in your mirror registry before you can use {cgu-operator} to update your disconnected clusters. Complete the following steps to mirror the images:

* For platform updates, you must perform the following steps:
+
. Mirror the desired {product-title} image repository. Ensure that the desired platform image is mirrored by following the "Mirroring the {product-title} image repository" procedure linked in the Additional Resources. Save the contents of the `imageContentSources` section in the `imageContentSources.yaml` file:
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
imageContentSources:
 - mirrors:
   - mirror-ocp-registry.ibmcloud.io.cpak:5000/openshift-release-dev/openshift4

   source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev
----

. Save the image signature of the desired platform image that was mirrored. You must add the image signature to the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR for platform updates. To get the image signature, perform the following steps:

.. Specify the desired {product-title} tag by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ OCP_RELEASE_NUMBER=<release_version>
----

.. Specify the architecture of the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ARCHITECTURE=<cluster_architecture> <1>
----
<1> Specify the architecture of the cluster, such as `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `s390x`, or `ppc64le`.

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ SIGNATURE_BASE64=$(curl -s "https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/signatures/openshift/release/${DIGEST_ALGO}=${DIGEST_ENCODED}/signature-1" | base64 -w0 && echo)
----

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat >checksum-${OCP_RELEASE_NUMBER}.yaml <<EOF

EOF
----

. Prepare the update graph. You have two options to prepare the update graph:

.. Use the OpenShift Update Service.
+
For more information about how to set up the graph on the hub cluster, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html/clusters/managing-your-clusters#deploy-the-operator-for-cincinnati[Deploy the operator for OpenShift Update Service] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html/clusters/managing-your-clusters#build-the-graph-data-init-container[Build the graph data init container].

.. Make a local copy of the upstream graph. Host the update graph on an `http` or `https` server in the disconnected environment that has access to the managed cluster. To download the update graph, use the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl -s https://api.openshift.com/api/upgrades_info/v1/graph?channel=stable-{product-version} -o ~/upgrade-graph_stable-{product-version}
----

* For Operator updates, you must perform the following task:

** Mirror the Operator catalogs. Ensure that the desired operator images are mirrored by following the procedure in the "Mirroring Operator catalogs for use with disconnected clusters" section.

You can perform a platform update with the {cgu-operator}.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {cgu-operator-first}.
* Update {ztp-first} to the latest version.
* Provision one or more managed clusters with {ztp}.
* Mirror the desired image repository.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Create {rh-rhacm} policies in the hub cluster.

.Procedure

. Create a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR for the platform update:

The `PolicyGenTemplate` CR generates two policies:

* The `du-upgrade-platform-upgrade-prep` policy does the preparation work for the platform update. It creates the `ConfigMap` CR for the desired release image signature, creates the image content source of the mirrored release image repository, and updates the cluster version with the desired update channel and the update graph reachable by the managed cluster in the disconnected environment.

* The `du-upgrade-platform-upgrade` policy is used to perform platform upgrade.

.. Add the `du-upgrade.yaml` file contents to the `kustomization.yaml` file located in the {ztp} Git repository for the `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs and push the changes to the Git repository.
+
ArgoCD pulls the changes from the Git repository and generates the policies on the hub cluster.

<1> The index image URL contains the desired Operator images. If the index images are always pushed to the same image name and tag, this change is not needed.
<2> Set how frequently the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) polls the index image for new Operator versions with the `registryPoll.interval` field. This change is not needed if a new index image tag is always pushed for y-stream and z-stream Operator updates. The `registryPoll.interval` field can be set to a shorter interval to expedite the update, however shorter intervals increase computational load. To counteract this, you can restore `registryPoll.interval` to the default value once the update is complete.
<3> Last observed state of the catalog connection. The `READY` value ensures that the `CatalogSource` policy is ready, indicating that the index pod is pulled and is running. This way, {cgu-operator} upgrades the Operators based on up-to-date policy compliance states.

.. This update generates one policy, `du-upgrade-operator-catsrc-policy`, to update the `redhat-operators` catalog source with the new index images that contain the desired Operators images.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to use the image pre-caching for Operators and there are Operators from a different catalog source other than `redhat-operators`,  you must perform the following tasks:

* Prepare a separate catalog source policy with the new index image or registry poll interval update for the different catalog source.
* Prepare a separate subscription policy for the desired Operators that are from the different catalog source.
====
+
For example, the desired SRIOV-FEC Operator is available in the `certified-operators` catalog source. To update the catalog source and the Operator subscription, add the following contents to generate two policies, `du-upgrade-fec-catsrc-policy` and `du-upgrade-subscriptions-fec-policy`:

----

.. Remove the specified subscriptions channels in the common `PolicyGenTemplate` CR, if they exist. The default subscriptions channels from the {ztp} image are used for the update.
+
[NOTE]
====
The default channel for the Operators applied through {ztp} {product-version} is `stable`, except for the `performance-addon-operator`. As of {product-title} 4.11, the `performance-addon-operator` functionality was moved to the `node-tuning-operator`. For the 4.10 release, the default channel for PAO is `v4.10`. You can also specify the default channels in the common `PolicyGenTemplate` CR.
====

.. Push the `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs updates to the {ztp} Git repository.
+
ArgoCD pulls the changes from the Git repository and generates the policies on the hub cluster.

.. Check the created policies by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies -A | grep -E "catsrc-policy|subscription"
----

. Apply the required catalog source updates before starting the Operator update.

.. Save the content of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR named `operator-upgrade-prep` with the catalog source policies and the target managed clusters to the `cgu-operator-upgrade-prep.yml` file:

<1> The policy is needed by the image pre-caching feature to retrieve the operator images from the catalog source.
<2> The policy contains Operator subscriptions. If you have followed the structure and content of the reference `PolicyGenTemplates`, all Operator subscriptions are grouped into the `common-subscriptions-policy` policy.
+
[NOTE]
====
One `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR can only pre-cache the images of the desired Operators defined in the subscription policy from one catalog source included in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. If the desired Operators are from different catalog sources, such as in the example of the SRIOV-FEC Operator, another `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR must be created with `du-upgrade-fec-catsrc-policy` and `du-upgrade-subscriptions-fec-policy` policies for the SRIOV-FEC Operator images pre-caching and update.

= Troubleshooting missed Operator updates due to out-of-date policy compliance states

In some scenarios, {cgu-operator-first} might miss Operator updates due to an out-of-date policy compliance state.

After a catalog source update, it takes time for the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to update the subscription status. The status of the subscription policy might continue to show as compliant while {cgu-operator} decides whether remediation is needed. As a result, the Operator specified in the subscription policy does not get upgraded.

To avoid this scenario, add another catalog source configuration to the `PolicyGenTemplate` and specify this configuration in the subscription for any Operators that require an update.

.Procedure

. Add a catalog source configuration in the `PolicyGenTemplate` resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----

      remediationAction: inform
      policyName: "operator-catsrc-policy"

----

.. Check if the pre-caching is completed before starting the update by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cgu cgu-du-upgrade -ojsonpath='{.status.conditions}'
----

. Start the platform and Operator update.
.. Enable the `cgu-du-upgrade` `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR to start the platform and the Operator update by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --namespace=default patch clustergroupupgrade.ran.openshift.io/cgu-du-upgrade \

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies --all-namespaces
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The CRs for the platform and Operator updates can be created from the beginning by configuring the setting to `spec.enable: true`. In this case, the update starts immediately after pre-caching completes and there is no need to manually enable the CR.

Both pre-caching and the update create extra resources, such as policies, placement bindings, placement rules, managed cluster actions, and managed cluster view, to help complete the procedures. Setting the `afterCompletion.deleteObjects` field to `true` deletes all these resources after the updates complete.

= Removing Performance Addon Operator subscriptions from deployed clusters

In earlier versions of {product-title}, the Performance Addon Operator provided automatic, low latency performance tuning for applications. In {product-title} 4.11 or later, these functions are part of the Node Tuning Operator.

Do not install the Performance Addon Operator on clusters running {product-title} 4.11 or later. If you upgrade to {product-title} 4.11 or later, the Node Tuning Operator automatically removes the Performance Addon Operator.

[NOTE]
====
You need to remove any policies that create Performance Addon Operator subscriptions to prevent a re-installation of the Operator.
====

The reference DU profile includes the Performance Addon Operator in the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR `common-ranGen.yaml`. To remove the subscription from deployed managed clusters, you must update `common-ranGen.yaml`.

[NOTE]
====
If you install Performance Addon Operator 4.10.3-5 or later on {product-title} 4.11 or later, the Performance Addon Operator detects the cluster version and automatically hibernates to avoid interfering with the Node Tuning Operator functions. However, to ensure best performance, remove the Performance Addon Operator from your {product-title} 4.11 clusters.
====

.Prerequisites

* Create a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data. The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for ArgoCD.

* Update to {product-title} 4.11 or later.

* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Change the `complianceType` to `mustnothave` for the Performance Addon Operator namespace, Operator group, and subscription in the `common-ranGen.yaml` file.
+
[source,yaml]
----
 -  fileName: PaoSubscriptionNS.yaml
    policyName: "subscriptions-policy"
    complianceType: mustnothave
 -  fileName: PaoSubscriptionOperGroup.yaml
    policyName: "subscriptions-policy"
    complianceType: mustnothave
 -  fileName: PaoSubscription.yaml
    policyName: "subscriptions-policy"
    complianceType: mustnothave
----

. Merge the changes with your custom site repository and wait for the ArgoCD application to synchronize the change to the hub cluster. The status of the `common-subscriptions-policy` policy changes to `Non-Compliant`.

. Apply the change to your target clusters by using the {cgu-operator-full}. For more information about rolling out configuration changes, see the "Additional resources" section.

. Monitor the process. When the status of the `common-subscriptions-policy` policy for a target cluster  is `Compliant`, the Performance Addon Operator has been removed from the cluster. Get the status of the `common-subscriptions-policy` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policy -n ztp-common common-subscriptions-policy
----

. Delete the Performance Addon Operator namespace, Operator group and subscription CRs from `.spec.sourceFiles` in the `common-ranGen.yaml` file.

. Merge the changes with your custom site repository and wait for the ArgoCD application to synchronize the change to the hub cluster. The policy remains compliant.

[id="talo-precache-autocreated-cgu-for-ztp_{context}"]
= About the auto-created ClusterGroupUpgrade CR for {ztp}

{cgu-operator} has a controller called `ManagedClusterForCGU` that monitors the `Ready` state of the `ManagedCluster` CRs on the hub cluster and creates the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CRs for {ztp-first}.

For any managed cluster in the `Ready` state without a `ztp-done` label applied, the `ManagedClusterForCGU` controller automatically creates a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR in the `ztp-install` namespace with its associated {rh-rhacm} policies that are created during the {ztp} process. {cgu-operator} then remediates the set of configuration policies that are listed in the auto-created `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR to push the configuration CRs to the managed cluster.

If there are no policies for the managed cluster at the time when the cluster becomes `Ready`, a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with no policies is created. Upon completion of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` the managed cluster is labeled as `ztp-done`. If there are policies that you want to apply for that managed cluster, manually create a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` as a day-2 operation.

toc::[]

You can update the {ztp-first} infrastructure independently from the hub cluster, {rh-rhacm-first}, and the managed {product-title} clusters.

[NOTE]
====
You can update the {gitops-title} Operator when new versions become available. When updating the {ztp} plugin, review the updated files in the reference configuration and ensure that the changes meet your requirements.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="ztp-updating-gitops-ztp_{context}"]
= Overview of the {ztp} update process

You can update {ztp-first} for a fully operational hub cluster running an earlier version of the {ztp} infrastructure. The update process avoids impact on managed clusters.

[NOTE]
====
Any changes to policy settings, including adding recommended content, results in updated polices that must be rolled out to the managed clusters and reconciled.
====

At a high level, the strategy for updating the {ztp} infrastructure is as follows:

. Label all existing clusters with the `ztp-done` label.

. Stop the ArgoCD applications.

. Install the new {ztp} tools.

. Update required content and optional changes in the Git repository.

. Update and restart the application configuration.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="ztp-preparing-for-the-gitops-ztp-upgrade_{context}"]
= Preparing for the upgrade

Use the following procedure to prepare your site for the {ztp-first} upgrade.

.Procedure

. Get the latest version of the {ztp} container that has the custom resources (CRs) used to configure {gitops-title} for use with {ztp}.

. Extract the `argocd/deployment` directory by using the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir -p ./update
----
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run --log-driver=none --rm registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ztp-site-generate-rhel8:v{product-version} extract /home/ztp --tar | tar x -C ./update
----
+
The `/update` directory contains the following subdirectories:
+
* `update/extra-manifest`: contains the source CR files that the `SiteConfig` CR uses to generate the extra manifest `configMap`.
* `update/source-crs`: contains the source CR files that the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR uses to generate the {rh-rhacm-first} policies.
* `update/argocd/deployment`: contains patches and YAML files to apply on the hub cluster for use in the next step of this procedure.
* `update/argocd/example`: contains example `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` files that represent the recommended configuration.

. Update the `clusters-app.yaml` and `policies-app.yaml` files to reflect the name of your applications and the URL, branch, and path for your Git repository.
+
If the upgrade includes changes that results in obsolete policies, the obsolete policies should be removed prior to performing the upgrade.

. Diff the changes between the configuration and deployment source CRs in the `/update` folder and Git repo where you manage your fleet site CRs. Apply and push the required changes to your site repository.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When you update {ztp} to the latest version, you must apply the changes from the `update/argocd/deployment` directory to your site repository. Do not use older versions of the `argocd/deployment/` files.

[id="ztp-labeling-the-existing-clusters_{context}"]
= Labeling the existing clusters

To ensure that existing clusters remain untouched by the tool updates, label all existing managed clusters with the `ztp-done` label.

[NOTE]
====
This procedure only applies when updating clusters that were not provisioned with {cgu-operator-first}. Clusters that you provision with {cgu-operator} are automatically labeled with `ztp-done`.
====

.Procedure

. Find a label selector that lists the managed clusters that were deployed with {ztp-first}, such as `local-cluster!=true`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedcluster -l 'local-cluster!=true'
----

. Ensure that the resulting list contains all the managed clusters that were deployed with {ztp}, and then use that selector to add the `ztp-done` label:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label managedcluster -l 'local-cluster!=true' ztp-done=

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="ztp-stopping-the-existing-gitops-ztp-applications_{context}"]
= Stopping the existing {ztp} applications

Removing the existing applications ensures that any changes to existing content in the Git repository are not rolled out until the new version of the tools is available.

Use the application files from the `deployment` directory. If you used custom names for the applications, update the names in these files first.

.Procedure

. Perform a non-cascaded delete on the `clusters` application to leave all generated resources in place:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f update/argocd/deployment/clusters-app.yaml
----

. Perform a cascaded delete on the `policies` application to remove all previous policies:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch -f policies-app.yaml -p '{"metadata": {"finalizers": ["resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io"]}}' --type merge
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f update/argocd/deployment/policies-app.yaml

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="ztp-required-changes-to-the-git-repository_{context}"]
= Required changes to the Git repository

When upgrading the `ztp-site-generate` container from an earlier release of {ztp-first} to 4.10 or later, there are additional requirements for the contents of the Git repository. Existing content in the repository must be updated to reflect these changes.

* Make required changes to `PolicyGenTemplate` files:
+
All `PolicyGenTemplate` files must be created in a `Namespace` prefixed with `ztp`. This ensures that the {ztp} application is able to manage the policy CRs generated by {ztp} without conflicting with the way {rh-rhacm-first} manages the policies internally.

* Add the `kustomization.yaml` file to the repository:
+
All `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs must be included in a `kustomization.yaml` file under their respective directory trees. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
├── policygentemplates
│   ├── site1-ns.yaml
│   ├── site1.yaml
│   ├── site2-ns.yaml
│   ├── site2.yaml
│   ├── common-ns.yaml
│   ├── common-ranGen.yaml
│   ├── group-du-sno-ranGen-ns.yaml
│   ├── group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml
│   └── kustomization.yaml
└── siteconfig
    ├── site1.yaml
    ├── site2.yaml
    └── kustomization.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The files listed in the `generator` sections must contain either `SiteConfig` or `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs only. If your existing YAML files contain other CRs, for example, `Namespace`, these other CRs must be pulled out into separate files and listed in the `resources` section.
====
+
The `PolicyGenTemplate` kustomization file must contain all `PolicyGenTemplate` YAML files in the `generator` section and `Namespace` CRs in the `resources` section. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

generators:
- common-ranGen.yaml
- group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml
- site1.yaml
- site2.yaml

resources:
- common-ns.yaml
- group-du-sno-ranGen-ns.yaml
- site1-ns.yaml
- site2-ns.yaml
----
+
The `SiteConfig` kustomization file must contain all `SiteConfig` YAML files in the `generator` section and any other CRs in the resources:
+
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

generators:
- site1.yaml
- site2.yaml
----

* Remove the `pre-sync.yaml` and `post-sync.yaml` files.
+
In {product-title} 4.10 and later, the `pre-sync.yaml` and `post-sync.yaml` files are no longer required. The `update/deployment/kustomization.yaml` CR manages the policies deployment on the hub cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
There is a set of `pre-sync.yaml` and `post-sync.yaml` files under both the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` trees.
====

* Review and incorporate recommended changes
+
Each release may include additional recommended changes to the configuration applied to deployed clusters. Typically these changes result in lower CPU use by the OpenShift platform, additional features, or improved tuning of the platform.
+
Review the reference `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs applicable to the types of cluster in your network. These examples can be found in the `argocd/example` directory extracted from the {ztp} container.

= Installing the new {ztp} applications

Using the extracted `argocd/deployment` directory, and after ensuring that the applications point to your site Git repository, apply the full contents of the deployment directory. Applying the full contents of the directory ensures that all necessary resources for the applications are correctly configured.

.Procedure

. To patch the ArgoCD instance in the hub cluster by using the patch file that you previously extracted into the `update/argocd/deployment/` directory, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch argocd openshift-gitops \
-n openshift-gitops --type=merge \
--patch-file update/argocd/deployment/argocd-openshift-gitops-patch.json

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="ztp-roll-out-the-configuration-changes_{context}"]
= Rolling out the {ztp} configuration changes

If any configuration changes were included in the upgrade due to implementing recommended changes, the upgrade process results in a set of policy CRs on the hub cluster in the `Non-Compliant` state. With the {ztp-first} version 4.10 and later `ztp-site-generate` container, these policies are set to `inform` mode and are not pushed to the managed clusters without an additional step by the user. This ensures that potentially disruptive changes to the clusters can be managed in terms of when the changes are made, for example, during a maintenance window, and how many clusters are updated concurrently.

To roll out the changes, create one or more `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CRs as detailed in the {cgu-operator} documentation. The CR must contain the list of `Non-Compliant` policies that you want to push out to the managed clusters as well as a list or selector of which clusters should be included in the update.

toc::[]

You can expand {sno} clusters with {ztp-first}. When you add worker nodes to {sno} clusters, the original {sno} cluster retains the control plane node role. Adding worker nodes does not require any downtime for the existing {sno} cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Although there is no specified limit on the number of worker nodes that you can add to a {sno} cluster, you must revaluate the reserved CPU allocation on the control plane node for the additional worker nodes.
====

If you require workload partitioning on the worker node, you must deploy and remediate the managed cluster policies on the hub cluster before installing the node. This way, the workload partitioning `MachineConfig` objects are rendered and associated with the `worker` machine config pool before the {ztp} workflow applies the `MachineConfig` ignition file to the worker node.

It is recommended that you first remediate the policies, and then install the worker node.
If you create the workload partitioning manifests after installing the worker node, you must drain the node manually and delete all the pods managed by daemon sets. When the managing daemon sets create the new pods, the new pods undergo the workload partitioning process.

[id="ztp-additional-worker-apply-du-profile_{context}"]
= Applying profiles to the worker node

You can configure the additional worker node with a DU profile.

You can apply a RAN distributed unit (DU) profile to the worker node cluster using the {ztp-first} common, group, and site-specific `PolicyGenTemplate` resources. The {ztp} pipeline that is linked to the ArgoCD `policies` application includes the following CRs that you can find in the `out/argocd/example/policygentemplates` folder when you extract the `ztp-site-generate` container:

* `common-ranGen.yaml`
* `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml`
* `example-sno-site.yaml`
* `ns.yaml`
* `kustomization.yaml`

Configuring the DU profile on the worker node is considered an upgrade. To initiate the upgrade flow, you must update the existing policies or create additional ones. Then, you must create a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR to reconcile the policies in the group of clusters.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="ztp-additional-worker-daemon-selector-comp_{context}"]
= (Optional) Ensuring PTP and SR-IOV daemon selector compatibility

If the DU profile was deployed using the {ztp-first} plugin version 4.11 or earlier, the PTP and SR-IOV Operators might be configured to place the daemons only on nodes labelled as `master`. This configuration prevents the PTP and SR-IOV daemons from operating on the worker node. If the PTP and SR-IOV daemon node selectors are incorrectly configured on your system, you must change the daemons before proceeding with the worker DU profile configuration.

.Procedure

. Check the daemon node selector settings of the PTP Operator on one of the spoke clusters:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ptpoperatorconfig/default -n openshift-ptp -ojsonpath='{.spec}' | jq
----
+
.Example output for PTP Operator
+
[source,json]
----
{"daemonNodeSelector":{"node-role.kubernetes.io/master":""}} <1>
----
<1> If the node selector is set to `master`, the spoke was deployed with the version of the {ztp} plugin that requires changes.

. Check the daemon node selector settings of the SR-IOV Operator on one of the spoke clusters:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  oc get sriovoperatorconfig/default -n \
openshift-sriov-network-operator -ojsonpath='{.spec}' | jq
----
+
.Example output for SR-IOV Operator
+
[source,json]
----
{"configDaemonNodeSelector":{"node-role.kubernetes.io/worker":""},"disableDrain":false,"enableInjector":true,"enableOperatorWebhook":true} <1>
----
<1> If the node selector is set to `master`, the spoke was deployed with the version of the {ztp} plugin that requires changes.

. In the group policy, add the following `complianceType` and `spec` entries:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
    - fileName: PtpOperatorConfig.yaml
      policyName: "config-policy"
      complianceType: mustonlyhave
      spec:
        daemonNodeSelector:
          node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
    - fileName: SriovOperatorConfig.yaml
      policyName: "config-policy"
      complianceType: mustonlyhave
      spec:
        configDaemonNodeSelector:
          node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the `daemonNodeSelector` field causes temporary PTP synchronization loss and SR-IOV connectivity loss.
====

. Commit the changes in Git, and then push to the Git repository being monitored by the {ztp} ArgoCD application.

= PTP and SR-IOV node selector compatibility

The PTP configuration resources and SR-IOV network node policies use `node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ""` as the node selector. If the additional worker nodes have the same NIC configuration as the control plane node, the policies used to configure the control plane node can be reused for the worker nodes. However, the node selector must be changed to select both node types, for example with the `"node-role.kubernetes.io/worker"` label.

A generic `MachineConfig` CR is used to configure workload partitioning on the worker node. You can generate the content of `crio` and `kubelet` configuration files.

. Add the created policy template to the Git repository monitored by the ArgoCD `policies` application.

. Add the policy in the `kustomization.yaml` file.

. Commit the changes in Git, and then push to the Git repository being monitored by the {ztp} ArgoCD application.

. To remediate the new policies to your spoke cluster, create a TALM custom resource:

* Install and configure {rh-rhacm} 2.6 or later in an {product-title} 4.11 or later bare-metal hub cluster
* Install {cgu-operator-full} in the hub cluster
* Install {gitops-title} in the hub cluster
* Use the {ztp} `ztp-site-generate` container image version 4.12 or later
* Deploy a managed {sno} cluster with {ztp}
* Configure the Central Infrastructure Management as described in the {rh-rhacm} documentation
* Configure the DNS serving the cluster to resolve the internal API endpoint `api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`

.Procedure

. If you deployed your cluster by using the `example-sno.yaml` `SiteConfig` manifest, add your new worker node to the `spec.clusters['example-sno'].nodes` list:
+
[source,yaml]
----
nodes:
- hostName: "example-node2.example.com"
  role: "worker"
  bmcAddress: "idrac-virtualmedia+https://[1111:2222:3333:4444::bbbb:1]/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1"
  bmcCredentialsName:
    name: "example-node2-bmh-secret"
  bootMACAddress: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:11"
  bootMode: "UEFI"
  nodeNetwork:
    interfaces:
      - name: eno1
        macAddress: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:11"
    config:
      interfaces:
        - name: eno1
          type: ethernet
          state: up
          macAddress: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:11"
          ipv4:
            enabled: false
          ipv6:
            enabled: true
            address:
            - ip: 1111:2222:3333:4444::1
              prefix-length: 64
      dns-resolver:
        config:
          search:
          - example.com
          server:
          - 1111:2222:3333:4444::2
      routes:
        config:
        - destination: ::/0
          next-hop-interface: eno1
          next-hop-address: 1111:2222:3333:4444::1
          table-id: 254
----

. Create a BMC authentication secret for the new host, as referenced by the `bmcCredentialsName` field in the `spec.nodes` section of your `SiteConfig` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: "password"
  username: "username"
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: "example-node2-bmh-secret"
  namespace: example-sno
type: Opaque
----

. Commit the changes in Git, and then push to the Git repository that is being monitored by the {ztp} ArgoCD application.
+
When the ArgoCD `cluster` application synchronizes, two new manifests appear on the hub cluster generated by the {ztp} plugin:
+
* `BareMetalHost`
* `NMStateConfig`
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `cpuset` field should not be configured for the worker node. Workload partitioning for worker nodes is added through management policies after the node installation is complete.
====

.Verification

You can monitor the installation process in several ways.

* Check if the preprovisioning images are created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ppimg -n example-sno
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAMESPACE       NAME            READY   REASON
example-sno     example-sno     True    ImageCreated
example-sno     example-node2   True    ImageCreated
----

* Check the state of the bare-metal hosts:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get bmh -n example-sno
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME            STATE          CONSUMER   ONLINE   ERROR   AGE

----
<1> The `provisioning` state indicates that node booting from the installation media is in progress.

* Continuously monitor the installation process:

.. Watch the agent install process by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get agent -n example-sno --watch
----
+
.Example output

toc::[]

In environments with limited bandwidth where you use the {ztp-first} solution to deploy a large number of clusters, you want to avoid downloading all the images that are required for bootstrapping and installing {product-title}.
The limited bandwidth at remote {sno} sites can cause long deployment times.
The {factory-prestaging-tool} allows you to pre-stage servers before shipping them to the remote site for ZTP provisioning.

The {factory-prestaging-tool} does the following:

* Downloads the RHCOS rootfs image that is required by the minimal ISO to boot.
* Creates a partition from the installation disk labelled as `data`.
* Formats the disk in xfs.
* Creates a GUID Partition Table (GPT) data partition at the end of the disk, where the size of the partition is configurable by the tool.
* Copies the container images required to install {product-title}.
* Copies the container images required by ZTP to install {product-title}.
* Optional: Copies Day-2 Operators to the partition.

= Booting from a live operating system image

You can use the {factory-prestaging-tool} with to boot servers where only one disk is available and external disk drive cannot be attached to the server.

[WARNING]
====
{op-system} requires the disk to not be in use when the disk is about to be written with an {op-system} image.
====

Depending on the server hardware, you can mount the {op-system} live ISO on the blank server using one of the following methods:

* Using the Dell RACADM tool on a Dell server.
* Using the HPONCFG tool on a HP server.
* Using the Redfish BMC API.

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to automate the mounting procedure. To automate the procedure, you need to pull the required images and host them on a local HTTP server.
====

.Prerequisites

* You powered up the host.
* You have network connectivity to the host.

.Procedure

[NOTE]
====
This example procedure uses the Redfish BMC API to mount the {op-system} live ISO.
====

. Mount the {op-system} live ISO:

.. Check virtual media status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl --globoff -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H \
"Accept: application/json" -k -X GET --user ${username_password} \
https://$BMC_ADDRESS/redfish/v1/Managers/Self/VirtualMedia/1 | python -m json.tool
----

.. Mount the ISO file as a virtual media:

:_module-type: PROCEDURE
[id="ztp-partitioning_{context}"]
= Partitioning the disk

To run the full pre-caching process, you have to boot from a live ISO and use the {factory-prestaging-tool} from a container image to partition and pre-cache all the artifacts required.

A live ISO or {op-system} live ISO is required because the disk must not be in use when the operating system ({op-system}) is written to the device during the provisioning.
Single-disk servers can also be enabled with this procedure.

.Prerequisites

* You have a disk that is not partitioned.
* You have access to the `quay.io/openshift-kni/telco-ran-tools:latest` image.
* You have enough storage to install {product-title} and pre-cache the required images.

.Procedure

. Verify that the disk is cleared:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# lsblk
----

+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
loop0     7:0    0  93.8G  0 loop /run/ephemeral

nvme0n1 259:1    0   1.5T  0 disk
----

. Erase any file system, RAID or partition table signatures from the device:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# wipefs -a /dev/nvme0n1
----

+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
/dev/nvme0n1: 8 bytes were erased at offset 0x00000200 (gpt): 45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54
/dev/nvme0n1: 8 bytes were erased at offset 0x1749a955e00 (gpt): 45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54
/dev/nvme0n1: 2 bytes were erased at offset 0x000001fe (PMBR): 55 aa
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The tool fails if the disk is not empty because it uses partition number 1 of the device for pre-caching the artifacts.
====

[id="ztp-create-partition_{context}"]
== Creating the partition

Once the device is ready, you create a single partition and a GPT partition table.
The partition is automatically labelled as `data` and created at the end of the device.
Otherwise, the partition will be overridden by the `coreos-installer`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `coreos-installer` requires the partition to be created at the end of the device and to be labelled as `data`. Both requirements are necessary to save the partition when writing the {op-system} image to the disk.
====

.Prerequisites

* The container must run as `privileged` due to formatting host devices.
* You have to mount the `/dev` folder so that the process can be executed inside the container.

.Procedure

In the following example, the size of the partition is 250 GiB due to allow pre-caching the DU profile for Day 2 Operators.

. Run the container as `privileged` and partition the disk:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# podman run -v /dev:/dev --privileged \
--rm quay.io/openshift-kni/telco-ran-tools:latest -- \

[id="ztp-downloading-images_{context}"]
= Downloading the images

The {factory-prestaging-tool} allows you to download the following images to your partitioned server:

* {product-title} images
* Operator images that are included in the distributed unit (DU) profile for 5G RAN sites
* Operator images from disconnected registries

[NOTE]
====
The list of available Operator images can vary in different {product-title} releases.
====

[id="ztp-downloading-images-parallel-workers_{context}"]
== Downloading with parallel workers

The {factory-prestaging-tool} uses parallel workers to download multiple images simultaneously.
You can configure the number of workers with the `--parallel` or `-p` option.
The default number is set to 80% of the available CPUs to the server.

[NOTE]
====
Your login shell may be restricted to a subset of CPUs, which reduces the CPUs available to the container.
To remove this restriction, you can precede your commands with `taskset 0xffffffff`, for example:

[source,terminal]
----
# taskset 0xffffffff podman run --rm quay.io/openshift-kni/telco-ran-tools:latest factory-precaching-cli download --help
----
====

[id="ztp-preparing-ocp-images_{context}"]
== Preparing to download the {product-title} images

To download {product-title} container images, you need to know the multicluster engine (MCE) version. When you use the `--du-profile` flag, you also need to specify the {rh-rhacm-first} version running in the hub cluster that is going to provision the {sno}.

.Prerequisites

* You have {rh-rhacm} and MCE installed.
* You partitioned the storage device.
* You have enough space for the images on the partitioned device.
* You connected the bare-metal server to the Internet.
* You have a valid pull secret.

.Procedure

. Check the {rh-rhacm} and MCE version by running the following commands in the hub cluster:
+

. To access the container registry, copy a valid pull secret on the server to be installed:

.. Create the `.docker` folder:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir /root/.docker
----

.. Copy the valid pull in the `config.json` file to the previously created `.docker/` folder:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cp config.json /root/.docker/config.json <1>
----
<1> `/root/.docker/config.json` is the default path where `podman` checks for the login credentials for the registry.

[NOTE]
====
If you use a different registry to pull the required artifacts, you need to copy the proper pull secret.
If the local registry uses TLS, you need to include the certificates from the registry as well.

== Downloading the Operator images

You can also pre-cache Day-2 Operators used in the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) Distributed Unit (DU) cluster configuration. The Day-2 Operators depend on the installed {product-title} version.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need to include the {rh-rhacm} hub and MCE Operator versions by using the `--acm-version` and `--mce-version` flags so the {factory-prestaging-tool} can pre-cache the appropriate containers images for the {rh-rhacm} and MCE Operators.

== Pre-caching custom images in disconnected environments

The `--generate-imageset` argument stops the {factory-prestaging-tool} after the `ImageSetConfiguration` custom resource (CR) is generated.
This allows you to customize the `ImageSetConfiguration` CR before downloading any images.
After you customized the CR, you can use the `--skip-imageset` argument to download the images that you specified in the `ImageSetConfiguration` CR.

You can customize the `ImageSetConfiguration` CR in the following ways:

* Add Operators and additional images
* Remove Operators and additional images
* Change Operator and catalog sources to local or disconnected registries

.Procedure

. Pre-cache the images:

[id="ztp-pre-caching-config-clusters-ignitionconfigoverride_{context}"]
== Understanding the clusters.ignitionConfigOverride field

The `clusters.ignitionConfigOverride` field adds a configuration in Ignition format during the {ztp} discovery stage.
The configuration includes `systemd` services in the ISO mounted in virtual media. This way, the scripts are part of the discovery {op-system} live ISO and they can be used to load the Assisted Installer (AI) images.

`systemd` services:: The `systemd` services are `var-mnt.mount` and `precache-images.services`. The `precache-images.service` depends on the disk partition to be mounted in `/var/mnt` by the `var-mnt.mount` unit.
The service calls a script called `extract-ai.sh`.
`extract-ai.sh`:: The `extract-ai.sh` script extracts and loads the required images from the disk partition to the local container storage.
When the script finishes successfully, you can use the images locally.
`agent-fix-bz1964591`:: The `agent-fix-bz1964591` script is a workaround for an AI issue.
To prevent AI from removing the images, which can force the `agent.service` to pull the images again from the registry, the `agent-fix-bz1964591` script checks if the requested container images exist.

[id="ztp-pre-caching-config-nodes-installerargs_{context}"]
== Understanding the nodes.installerArgs field

The `nodes.installerArgs` field allows you to configure how the `coreos-installer` utility writes the {op-system} live ISO to disk. You need to indicate to save the disk partition labeled as `data` because the artifacts saved in the `data` partition are needed during the {product-title} installation stage.

The extra parameters are passed directly to the `coreos-installer` utility that writes the live {op-system} to disk.
On the next reboot, the operating system starts from the disk.

You can pass several options to the `coreos-installer` utility:

[source,terminal]
----
OPTIONS:
...
    -u, --image-url <URL>
            Manually specify the image URL

    -f, --image-file <path>
            Manually specify a local image file

    -i, --ignition-file <path>
            Embed an Ignition config from a file

    -I, --ignition-url <URL>
            Embed an Ignition config from a URL
...
        --save-partlabel <lx>...
            Save partitions with this label glob

        --save-partindex <id>...
            Save partitions with this number or range
...
        --insecure-ignition
            Allow Ignition URL without HTTPS or hash
----

[id="ztp-pre-caching-config-nodes-ignitionconfigoverride_{context}"]
== Understanding the nodes.ignitionConfigOverride field

Similarly to `clusters.ignitionConfigOverride`, the `nodes.ignitionConfigOverride` field allows the addtion of configurations in Ignition format to the `coreos-installer` utility, but at the {product-title} installation stage.
When the {op-system} is written to disk, the extra configuration included in the {ztp} discovery ISO is no longer available. During the discovery stage, the extra configuration is stored in the memory of the live OS.

[NOTE]
====
At this stage, the number of container images extracted and loaded is bigger than in the discovery stage. Depending on the {product-title} release and whether you install the Day-2 Operators, the installation time can vary.
====

At the installation stage, the `var-mnt.mount` and `precache-ocp.services` `systemd` services are used.

`precache-ocp.service`:: The `precache-ocp.service` depends on the disk partition to be mounted in `/var/mnt` by the `var-mnt.mount` unit.
The `precache-ocp.service` service calls a script called `extract-ocp.sh`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To extract all the images before the {product-title} installation, you must execute `precache-ocp.service` before executing the `machine-config-daemon-pull.service` and `nodeip-configuration.service` services.
====

`extract-ocp.sh`:: The `extract-ocp.sh` script extracts and loads the required images from the disk partition to the local container storage.
When the script finishes successfully, you can use the images locally.

When you upload the `SiteConfig` and the optional `PolicyGenTemplates` custom resources (CRs) to the Git repo, which Argo CD is monitoring, you can start the {ztp} workflow by syncing the CRs with the hub cluster.

== Rendered catalog is invalid

When you download images by using a local or disconnected registry, you might see the `The rendered catalog is invalid` error. This means that you are missing certificates of the new registry you want to pull content from.

[NOTE]
====
The {factory-prestaging-tool} image is built on a UBI {op-system-base} image. Certificate paths and locations are the same on {op-system}.
