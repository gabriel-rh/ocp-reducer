After installing {product-title}, a cluster administrator can configure and customize the following components:

* Machine
* Bare metal
* Cluster
* Node
* Network
* Storage
* Users
* Alerts and notifications

[id="post-install-tasks"]
== Configuration tasks to perform after installation

Cluster administrators can perform the following postinstallation configuration tasks:

* xref:post-install-machine-configuration-tasks[Configure operating system features]:
Machine Config Operator (MCO) manages `MachineConfig` objects. By using MCO, you can perform the following tasks on an {product-title} cluster:

** Configure nodes by using `MachineConfig` objects
** Configure MCO-related custom resources

* xref:post-install-bare-metal-configuration[Configure bare metal nodes]: The Bare Metal Operator (BMO) implements a Kubernetes API for managing bare metal hosts. It maintains an inventory of available bare metal hosts as instances of the BareMetalHost Custom Resource Definition (CRD). The Bare Metal Operator can:

** Inspect the host's hardware details and report them on the corresponding BareMetalHost. This includes information about CPUs, RAM, disks, NICs, and more.
** Inspect the host's firmware and configure BIOS settings.
** Provision hosts with a desired image.
** Clean a host's disk contents before or after provisioning.

* xref:post-install-cluster-tasks[Configure cluster features]:
As a cluster administrator, you can modify the configuration resources of the major features of an {product-title} cluster. These features include:

** Image registry
** Networking configuration
** Image build behavior
** Identity provider
** The etcd configuration
** Machine set creation to handle the workloads
** Cloud provider credential management

* xref:configuring-private-cluster[Configure cluster components to be private]:
By default, the installation program provisions {product-title} by using a publicly accessible DNS and endpoints. If you want your cluster to be accessible only from within an internal network, configure the following components to be private:

** DNS
** Ingress Controller
** API server

* xref:post-install-node-tasks[Perform node operations]:
By default, {product-title} uses {op-system-first} compute machines.
As a cluster administrator, you can perform the following operations with the machines in your {product-title} cluster:

** Add and remove compute machines
** Add and remove taints and tolerations to the nodes
** Configure the maximum number of pods per node
** Enable Device Manager

* xref:post-install-network-configuration[Configure network]:
After installing {product-title}, you can configure the following:

** Ingress cluster traffic
** Node port service range
** Network policy
** Enabling the cluster-wide proxy

* xref:post-install-storage-configuration[Configure storage]:
By default, containers operate using ephemeral storage or transient local storage. The ephemeral storage has a lifetime limitation. TO store the data for a long time, you must configure persistent storage.
You can configure storage by using one of the following methods:

** *Dynamic provisioning*: You can dynamically provision storage on demand by defining and creating storage classes that control different levels of storage, including storage access.

** *Static provisioning*: You can use Kubernetes persistent volumes to make existing storage available to a cluster. Static provisioning can support various device configurations and mount options.

* xref:post-install-preparing-for-users[Configure users]:
OAuth access tokens allow users to authenticate themselves to the API. As a cluster administrator, you can configure OAuth to perform the following tasks:
+
* Specify an identity provider
* Use role-based access control to define and supply permissions to users
* Install an Operator from OperatorHub

* xref:configuring-alert-notifications[Manage alerts and notifications]:
By default, firing alerts are displayed on the Alerting UI of the web console. You can also configure {product-title} to send alert notifications to external systems.

After you install an {product-title} version {product-version} cluster, you can set some of its core components to be private.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="private-clusters-about_{context}"]
= About private clusters


By default, {product-title} is provisioned using publicly-accessible DNS and endpoints. You can set the DNS, Ingress Controller, and API server to private after you deploy your private cluster.

// Text snippet included in the following modules:
//
// * modules/private-clusters-default.adoc

// * modules/private-clusters-about-aws.adoc

:_mod-docs-content-type: SNIPPET

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the cluster has any public subnets, load balancer services created by administrators might be publicly accessible. To ensure cluster security, verify that these services are explicitly annotated as private.
====

[discrete]
[id="private-clusters-about-dns_{context}"]
== DNS

If you install {product-title} on installer-provisioned infrastructure, the installation program creates records in a pre-existing public zone and, where possible, creates a private zone for the cluster's own DNS resolution. In both the public zone and the private zone, the installation program or cluster creates DNS entries for `*.apps`, for the `Ingress` object, and `api`, for the API server.

The `*.apps` records in the public and private zone are identical, so when you delete the public zone, the private zone seamlessly provides all DNS resolution for the cluster.

[discrete]
[id="private-clusters-about-ingress-controller_{context}"]
== Ingress Controller
Because the default `Ingress` object is created as public, the load balancer is internet-facing and in the public subnets.

The Ingress Operator generates a default certificate for an Ingress Controller to serve as a placeholder until you configure a custom default certificate. Do not use Operator-generated default certificates in production clusters. The Ingress Operator does not rotate its own signing certificate or the default certificates that it generates. Operator-generated default certificates are intended as placeholders for custom default certificates that you configure.

[discrete]
[id="private-clusters-about-api-server_{context}"]
== API server

By default, the installation program creates appropriate network load balancers for the API server to use for both internal and external traffic.

On Amazon Web Services (AWS), separate public and private load balancers are created. The load balancers are identical except that an additional port is available on the internal one for use within the cluster. Although the installation program automatically creates or destroys the load balancer based on API server requirements, the cluster does not manage or maintain them. As long as you preserve the cluster's access to the API server, you can manually modify or move the load balancers. For the public load balancer, port 6443 is open and the health check is configured for HTTPS against the `/readyz` path.

On Google Cloud Platform, a single load balancer is created to manage both internal and external API traffic, so you do not need to modify the load balancer.

On Microsoft Azure, both public and private load balancers are created. However, because of limitations in current implementation, you just retain both load balancers in a private cluster.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="private-clusters-setting-dns-private_{context}"]
= Setting DNS to private

After you deploy a cluster, you can modify its DNS to use only a private zone.

.Procedure

. Review the `DNS` custom resource for your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get dnses.config.openshift.io/cluster -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: DNS
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2019-10-25T18:27:09Z"
  generation: 2
  name: cluster
  resourceVersion: "37966"
  selfLink: /apis/config.openshift.io/v1/dnses/cluster
  uid: 0e714746-f755-11f9-9cb1-02ff55d8f976
spec:
  baseDomain: <base_domain>
  privateZone:
    tags:
      Name: <infrastructure_id>-int
      kubernetes.io/cluster/<infrastructure_id>: owned
  publicZone:
    id: Z2XXXXXXXXXXA4
status: {}
----
+
Note that the `spec` section contains both a private and a public zone.

. Patch the `DNS` custom resource to remove the public zone:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch dnses.config.openshift.io/cluster --type=merge --patch='{"spec": {"publicZone": null}}'
dns.config.openshift.io/cluster patched
----
+
Because the Ingress Controller consults the `DNS` definition when it creates `Ingress` objects, when you create or modify `Ingress` objects, only private records are created.
+

= Restricting the API server to private

After you deploy a cluster to
Amazon Web Services (AWS) or
Microsoft Azure,
you can reconfigure the API server to use only the private zone.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Have access to the web console as a user with `admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. In the web portal or console for your cloud provider, take the following actions:

.. Locate and delete the appropriate load balancer component:
*** For AWS, delete the external load balancer. The API DNS entry in the private zone already points to the internal load balancer, which uses an identical configuration, so you do not need to modify the internal load balancer.
*** For Azure, delete the `api-internal` rule for the load balancer.

.. Delete the `api.$clustername.$yourdomain` DNS entry in the public zone.


. Remove the external load balancers:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You can run the following steps only for an installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI) cluster. For a user-provisioned infrastructure (UPI) cluster, you must manually remove or disable the external load balancers.

[id="nw-ingresscontroller-change-internal_{context}"]
= Configuring the Ingress Controller endpoint publishing scope to Internal

When a cluster administrator installs a new cluster without specifying that the cluster is private, the default Ingress Controller is created with a `scope` set to `External`. Cluster administrators can change an `External` scoped Ingress Controller to `Internal`.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the `oc` CLI.

.Procedure

* To change an `External` scoped Ingress Controller to `Internal`, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-ingress-operator patch ingresscontrollers/default --type=merge --patch='{"spec":{"endpointPublishingStrategy":{"type":"LoadBalancerService","loadBalancer":{"scope":"Internal"}}}}'
----
+
.Verification
+
* To check the status of the Ingress Controller, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-ingress-operator get ingresscontrollers/default -o yaml
----
+
** The `Progressing` status condition indicates whether you must take further action. For example, the status condition can indicate that you need to delete the service by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-ingress delete services/router-default
----
+
If you delete the service, the Ingress Operator recreates it as `Internal`.

[id="registry-configuring-private-storage-endpoint-azure_{context}"]
= Configuring a private storage endpoint on Azure

You can leverage the Image Registry Operator to use private endpoints on Azure, which enables seamless configuration of private storage accounts when {product-title} is deployed on private Azure clusters. This allows you to deploy the image registry without exposing public-facing storage endpoints.

You can configure the Image Registry Operator to use private storage endpoints on Azure in one of two ways:

* By configuring the Image Registry Operator to discover the VNet and subnet names

* With user-provided Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and subnet names

[id="limitations-configuring-private-storage-endpoint-azure"]
== Limitations for configuring a private storage endpoint on Azure

The following limitations apply when configuring a private storage endpoint on Azure:

* When configuring the Image Registry Operator to use a private storage endpoint, public network access to the storage account is disabled. Consequently, pulling images from the registry outside of {product-title} only works by setting `disableRedirect: true` in the registry Operator configuration. With redirect enabled, the registry redirects the client to pull images directly from the storage account, which will no longer work due to disabled public network access. For more information, see "Disabling redirect when using a private storage endpoint on Azure".

* This operation cannot be undone by the Image Registry Operator.

[id="disabling-redirect-private-storage-endpoint-azure_{context}"]
= Optional: Disabling redirect when using a private storage endpoint on Azure

By default, redirect is enabled when using the image registry. Redirect allows off-loading of traffic from the registry pods into the object storage, which makes pull faster. When redirect is enabled and the storage account is private, users from outside of the cluster are unable to pull images from the registry.

In some cases, users might want to disable redirect so that users from outside of the cluster can pull images from the registry.

Use the following procedure to disable redirect.

.Prerequisites

* You have configured the image registry to run on Azure.
* You have configured a route.

When deploying {product-title} on bare metal hosts, there are times when you need to make changes to the host either before or after provisioning. This can include inspecting the host's hardware, firmware, and firmware details. It can also include formatting disks or changing modifiable firmware settings.

= About the Bare Metal Operator

Use the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) to provision, manage, and inspect bare-metal hosts in your cluster.

The BMO uses three resources to complete these tasks:

* `BareMetalHost`
* `HostFirmwareSettings`
* `FirmwareSchema`

The BMO maintains an inventory of the physical hosts in the cluster by mapping each bare-metal host to an instance of the `BareMetalHost` custom resource definition. Each `BareMetalHost` resource features hardware, software, and firmware details. The BMO continually inspects the bare-metal hosts in the cluster to ensure each `BareMetalHost` resource accurately details the components of the corresponding host.

The BMO also uses the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource and the `FirmwareSchema` resource to detail firmware specifications for the bare-metal host.

The BMO interfaces with bare-metal hosts in the cluster by using the Ironic API service. The Ironic service uses the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) on the host to interface with the machine.

Some common tasks you can complete by using the BMO include the following:

* Provision bare-metal hosts to the cluster with a specific image
* Format a host's disk contents before provisioning or after deprovisioning
* Turn on or off a host
* Change firmware settings
* View the host's hardware details

= Bare Metal Operator architecture

The Bare Metal Operator (BMO) uses three resources to provision, manage, and inspect bare-metal hosts in your cluster. The following diagram illustrates the architecture of these resources:

image::302_OpenShift_Bare_Metal_Operator_0223.png[BMO architecture overview]

.BareMetalHost

The `BareMetalHost` resource defines a physical host and its properties. When you provision a bare-metal host to the cluster, you must define a `BareMetalHost` resource for that host. For ongoing management of the host, you can inspect the information in the `BareMetalHost` or update this information.

The `BareMetalHost` resource features provisioning information such as the following:

* Deployment specifications such as the operating system boot image or the custom RAM disk
* Provisioning state
* Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) address
* Desired power state

The `BareMetalHost` resource features hardware information such as the following:

* Number of CPUs
* MAC address of a NIC
* Size of the host's storage device
* Current power state

.HostFirmwareSettings
You can use the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource to retrieve and manage the firmware settings for a host. When a host moves to the `Available` state, the Ironic service reads the host's firmware settings and creates the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource. There is a one-to-one mapping between the `BareMetalHost` resource and the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource.

You can use the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource to inspect the firmware specifications for a host or to update a host's firmware specifications.

[NOTE]
====
You must adhere to the schema specific to the vendor firmware when you edit the `spec` field of the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource. This schema is defined in the read-only `FirmwareSchema` resource.
====

.FirmwareSchema
Firmware settings vary among hardware vendors and host models. A `FirmwareSchema` resource is a read-only resource that contains the types and limits for each firmware setting on each host model. The data comes directly from the BMC by using the Ironic service. The `FirmwareSchema` resource enables you to identify valid values you can specify in the `spec` field of the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource.

A `FirmwareSchema` resource can apply to many `BareMetalHost` resources if the schema is the same.

= About the BareMetalHost resource

Metal^3^ introduces the concept of the `BareMetalHost` resource, which defines a physical host and its properties. The `BareMetalHost` resource contains two sections:

. The `BareMetalHost` spec
. The `BareMetalHost` status

== The BareMetalHost spec

The `spec` section of the `BareMetalHost` resource defines the desired state of the host.

.BareMetalHost spec
[options="header"]
|====
|Parameters |Description

| `automatedCleaningMode`
| An interface to enable or disable automated cleaning during provisioning and de-provisioning. When set to `disabled`, it skips automated cleaning. When set to `metadata`, automated cleaning is enabled. The default setting is `metadata`.

a|
----
bmc:
  address:
  credentialsName:
  disableCertificateVerification:
----
a| The `bmc` configuration setting contains the connection information for the baseboard management controller (BMC) on the host. The fields are:

* `address`: The URL for communicating with the host's BMC controller.

* `credentialsName`: A reference to a secret containing the username and password for the BMC.

* `disableCertificateVerification`: A boolean to skip certificate validation when set to `true`.

| `bootMACAddress`
| The MAC address of the NIC used for provisioning the host.

| `bootMode`
| The boot mode of the host. It defaults to `UEFI`, but it can also be set to `legacy` for BIOS boot, or `UEFISecureBoot`.

| `consumerRef`
| A reference to another resource that is using the host. It could be empty if another resource is not currently using the host. For example, a `Machine` resource might use the host when the `machine-api` is using the host.

| `description`
| A human-provided string to help identify the host.

| `externallyProvisioned`
a| A boolean indicating whether the host provisioning and deprovisioning are managed externally. When set:

* Power status can still be managed using the online field.
* Hardware inventory will be monitored, but no provisioning or deprovisioning operations are performed on the host.

| `firmware`
a| Contains information about the BIOS configuration of bare metal hosts. Currently, `firmware` is only supported by iRMC, iDRAC, iLO4 and iLO5 BMCs. The sub fields are:

** `simultaneousMultithreadingEnabled`: Allows a single physical processor core to appear as several logical processors. Valid settings are `true` or `false`.
** `sriovEnabled`: SR-IOV support enables a hypervisor to create virtual instances of a PCI-express device, potentially increasing performance. Valid settings are `true` or `false`.
** `virtualizationEnabled`: Supports the virtualization of platform hardware. Valid settings are `true` or `false`.

a|
----
image:
  url:
  checksum:
  checksumType:
  format:
----
a| The `image` configuration setting holds the details for the image to be deployed on the host. Ironic requires the image fields. However, when the `externallyProvisioned` configuration setting is set to `true` and the external management doesn't require power control, the fields can be empty. The fields are:

* `url`: The URL of an image to deploy to the host.
* `checksum`: The actual checksum or a URL to a file containing the checksum for the image at `image.url`.
* `checksumType`: You can specify checksum algorithms. Currently `image.checksumType` only supports `md5`, `sha256`, and `sha512`. The default checksum type is `md5`.
* `format`: This is the disk format of the image. It can be one of `raw`, `qcow2`, `vdi`, `vmdk`, `live-iso` or be left unset. Setting it to `raw` enables raw image streaming in the Ironic agent for that image. Setting it to `live-iso` enables iso images to live boot without deploying to disk, and it ignores the `checksum` fields.

| `networkData`
| A reference to the secret containing the network configuration data and its namespace, so that it can be attached to the host before the host boots to set up the network.

| `online`
| A boolean indicating whether the host should be powered on (`true`) or off (`false`). Changing this value will trigger a change in the power state of the physical host.

a|
----
raid:
  hardwareRAIDVolumes:
  softwareRAIDVolumes:
----
a|  (Optional) Contains the information about the RAID configuration for bare metal hosts. If not specified, it retains the current configuration.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} {product-version} supports hardware RAID for BMCs, including:

* Fujitsu iRMC with support for RAID levels 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10
* Dell iDRAC using the Redfish API with firmware version 6.10.30.20 or later and RAID levels 0, 1, and 5

{product-title} {product-version} does not support software RAID.
====

See the following configuration settings:

* `hardwareRAIDVolumes`: Contains the list of logical drives for hardware RAID, and defines the desired volume configuration in the hardware RAID. If you don't specify `rootDeviceHints`, the first volume is the root volume. The sub-fields are:

** `level`: The RAID level for the logical drive. The following levels are supported: `0`,`1`,`2`,`5`,`6`,`1+0`,`5+0`,`6+0`.
** `name`: The name of the volume as a string. It should be unique within the server. If not specified, the volume name will be auto-generated.
** `numberOfPhysicalDisks`: The number of physical drives as an integer to use for the logical drove. Defaults to the minimum number of disk drives required for the particular RAID level.
** `physicalDisks`: The list of names of physical disk drives as a string. This is an optional field. If specified, the controller field must be specified too.
** `controller`: (Optional) The name of the RAID controller as a string to use in the hardware RAID volume.
** `rotational`: If set to `true`, it will only select rotational disk drives. If set to `false`, it will only select solid-state and NVMe drives. If not set, it selects any drive types, which is the default behavior.
** `sizeGibibytes`: The size of the logical drive as an integer to create in GiB. If unspecified or set to `0`, it will use the maximum capacity of physical drive for the logical drive.

* `softwareRAIDVolumes`: {product-title} {product-version} does not support software RAID. The following information is for reference only. This configuration contains the list of logical disks for software RAID. If you don't specify `rootDeviceHints`, the first volume is the root volume. If you set `HardwareRAIDVolumes`, this item will be invalid. Software RAIDs will always be deleted. The number of created software RAID devices must be `1` or `2`. If there is only one software RAID device, it must be `RAID-1`. If there are two RAID devices, the first device must be `RAID-1`, while the RAID level for the second device can be `0`, `1`, or `1+0`. The first RAID device will be the deployment device. Therefore, enforcing `RAID-1` reduces the risk of a non-booting node in case of a device failure. The `softwareRAIDVolume` field defines the desired configuration of the volume in the software RAID. The sub-fields are:

** `level`: The RAID level for the logical drive. The following levels are supported: `0`,`1`,`1+0`.
** `physicalDisks`: A list of device hints. The number of items should be greater than or equal to `2`.
** `sizeGibibytes`: The size of the logical disk drive as an integer to be created in GiB. If unspecified or set to `0`, it will use the maximum capacity of physical drive for logical drive.

You can set the `hardwareRAIDVolume` as an empty slice to clear the hardware RAID configuration. For example:

----
spec:
   raid:
     hardwareRAIDVolume: []
----

If you receive an error message indicating that the driver does not support RAID, set the `raid`, `hardwareRAIDVolumes` or `softwareRAIDVolumes` to nil. You might need to ensure the host has a RAID controller.

  hctl:
  model:

----
a| The `rootDeviceHints` parameter enables provisioning of the {op-system} image to a particular device. It examines the devices in the order it discovers them, and compares the discovered values with the hint values. It uses the first discovered device that matches the hint value. The configuration can combine multiple hints, but a device must match all hints to get selected. The fields are:

* `deviceName`: A string containing a Linux device name like `/dev/vda`. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

* `hctl`: A string containing a SCSI bus address like `0:0:0:0`. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

* `model`: A string containing a vendor-specific device identifier. The hint can be a substring of the actual value.

* `vendor`: A string containing the name of the vendor or manufacturer of the device. The hint can be a sub-string of the actual value.

* `serialNumber`: A string containing the device serial number. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

* `minSizeGigabytes`: An integer representing the minimum size of the device in gigabytes.

* `wwn`: A string containing the unique storage identifier. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

* `wwnWithExtension`: A string containing the unique storage identifier with the vendor extension appended. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

* `wwnVendorExtension`: A string containing the unique vendor storage identifier. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

* `rotational`: A boolean indicating whether the device should be a rotating disk (true) or not (false).

= About the HostFirmwareSettings resource

You can use the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource to retrieve and manage the BIOS settings for a host. When a host moves to the `Available` state, Ironic reads the host's BIOS settings and creates the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource. The resource contains the complete BIOS configuration returned from the baseboard management controller (BMC). Whereas, the `firmware` field in the `BareMetalHost` resource returns three vendor-independent fields, the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource typically comprises many BIOS settings of vendor-specific fields per host.

The `HostFirmwareSettings` resource contains two sections:

. The `HostFirmwareSettings` spec.
. The `HostFirmwareSettings` status.

== The `HostFirmwareSettings` spec

The `spec` section of the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource defines the desired state of the host's BIOS, and it is empty by default. Ironic uses the settings in the `spec.settings` section to update the baseboard management controller (BMC) when the host is in the `Preparing` state. Use the `FirmwareSchema` resource to ensure that you do not send invalid name/value pairs to hosts. See "About the FirmwareSchema resource" for additional details.

.Example
[source,terminal]
----
spec:
  settings:
    ProcTurboMode: Disabled<1>
----
<1> In the foregoing example, the `spec.settings` section contains a name/value pair that will set the `ProcTurboMode` BIOS setting to `Disabled`.

[NOTE]
====
Integer parameters listed in the `status` section appear as strings. For example, `"1"`. When setting integers in the `spec.settings` section, the values should be set as integers without quotes. For example, `1`.
====

== The `HostFirmwareSettings` status

The `status` represents the current state of the host's BIOS.

= Editing the HostFirmwareSettings resource

You can edit the `HostFirmwareSettings` of provisioned hosts.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only edit hosts when they are in the `provisioned` state, excluding read-only values. You cannot edit hosts in the `externally provisioned` state.

====

.Procedure

. Get the list of `HostFirmwareSettings` resources:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get hfs -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Edit a host's `HostFirmwareSettings` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit hfs <host_name> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Where `<host_name>` is the name of a provisioned host. The `HostFirmwareSettings` resource will open in the default editor for your terminal.

. Add name/value pairs to the `spec.settings` section:
+
.Example
[source,terminal]
----
spec:
  settings:
    name: value <1>
----
<1> Use the `FirmwareSchema` resource to identify the available settings for the host. You cannot set values that are read-only.

. Save the changes and exit the editor.

. Get the host's machine name:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 $ oc get bmh <host_name> -n openshift-machine name
----
+
Where `<host_name>` is the name of the host. The machine name appears under the `CONSUMER` field.

. Annotate the machine to delete it from the machineset:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate machine <machine_name> machine.openshift.io/delete-machine=true -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Where `<machine_name>` is the name of the machine to delete.

. Get a list of nodes and count the number of worker nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----

. Get the machineset:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Scale the machineset:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale machineset <machineset_name> -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=<n-1>
----
+
Where `<machineset_name>` is the name of the machineset and `<n-1>` is the decremented number of worker nodes.

. When the host enters the `Available` state, scale up the machineset to make the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource changes take effect:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale machineset <machineset_name> -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=<n>
----
+
Where `<machineset_name>` is the name of the machineset and `<n>` is the number of worker nodes.

[id="verifying-the-hostfirmware-settings-resource-is-valid_{context}"]
= Verifying the HostFirmware Settings resource is valid

When the user edits the `spec.settings` section to make a change to the `HostFirmwareSetting`(HFS) resource, the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) validates the change against the `FimwareSchema` resource, which is a read-only resource. If the setting is invalid, the BMO will set the `Type` value of the `status.Condition` setting to `False` and also generate an event and store it in the HFS resource. Use the following procedure to verify that the resource is valid.

.Procedure

. Get a list of `HostFirmwareSetting` resources:

[id="about-the-firmwareschema-resource_{context}"]
= About the FirmwareSchema resource

BIOS settings vary among hardware vendors and host models. A `FirmwareSchema` resource is a read-only resource that contains the types and limits for each BIOS setting on each host model. The data comes directly from the BMC through Ironic. The `FirmwareSchema` enables you to identify valid values you can specify in the `spec` field of the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource. The `FirmwareSchema` resource has a unique identifier derived from its settings and limits. Identical host models use the same `FirmwareSchema` identifier. It is likely that multiple instances of `HostFirmwareSettings` use the same `FirmwareSchema`.

.FirmwareSchema specification

  upper_bound:
  min_length:
  max_length:
  read_only:

----

a| The `spec` is a simple map consisting of the BIOS setting name and the limits of the setting. The fields include:

* `attribute_type`: The type of setting. The supported types are:
** `Enumeration`
** `Integer`
** `String`
** `Boolean`
* `allowable_values`: A list of allowable values when the `attribute_type` is `Enumeration`.
* `lower_bound`: The lowest allowed value when `attribute_type` is `Integer`.
* `upper_bound`: The highest allowed value when `attribute_type` is `Integer`.
* `min_length`: The shortest string length that the value can have when `attribute_type` is `String`.
* `max_length`: The longest string length that the value can have when `attribute_type` is `String`.
* `read_only`: The setting is read only and cannot be modified.
* `unique`: The setting is specific to this host.

[id="getting-the-firmwareschema-resource_{context}"]
= Getting the FirmwareSchema resource

Each host model from each vendor has different BIOS settings. When editing the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource's `spec` section, the name/value pairs you set must conform to that host's firmware schema. To ensure you are setting valid name/value pairs, get the `FirmwareSchema` for the host and review it.

.Procedure

. To get a list of `FirmwareSchema` resource instances, execute the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get firmwareschema -n openshift-machine-api
----

. To get a particular `FirmwareSchema` instance, execute:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get firmwareschema <instance_name> -n openshift-machine-api -o yaml
----
+
Where `<instance_name>` is the name of the schema instance stated in the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource (see Table 3).

toc::[]

An {product-title} cluster with multi-architecture compute machines is a cluster that supports compute machines with different architectures. Clusters with multi-architecture compute machines are available only on Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure installer-provisioned infrastructures and bare metal, {ibm-power-name}, and {ibm-z-name} user-provisioned infrastructures with x86_64 control plane machines.

[NOTE]
====
When there are nodes with multiple architectures in your cluster, the architecture of your image must be consistent with the architecture of the node. You need to ensure that the pod is assigned to the node with the appropriate architecture and that it matches the image architecture. For more information on assigning pods to nodes, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/[Assigning pods to nodes].
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Cluster Samples Operator is not supported on clusters with multi-architecture compute machines. Your cluster can be created without this capability. For more information, see xref:enabling-cluster-capabilities[Enabling cluster capabilities]
====

For information on migrating your single-architecture cluster to a cluster that supports multi-architecture compute machines, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/updating_clusters/#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

== Configuring your cluster with multi-architecture compute machines

To create a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines for various platforms, you can use the documentation in the following sections:

* xref:creating-multi-arch-compute-nodes-azure[Creating a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on Azure]

* xref:creating-multi-arch-compute-nodes-aws[Creating a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on AWS]

To deploy an Azure cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you must first create a single-architecture Azure installer-provisioned cluster that uses the multi-architecture installer binary. For more information on Azure installations, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/installing/#installing-azure-customizations[Installing a cluster on Azure with customizations]. You can then add an ARM64 compute machine set to your cluster to create a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines.

The following procedures explain how to generate an ARM64 boot image and create an Azure compute machine set that uses the ARM64 boot image. This adds ARM64 compute nodes to your cluster and deploys the amount of ARM64 virtual machines (VM) that you need.

[id="multi-architecture-verifying-cluster-compatibility_{context}"]

= Verifying cluster compatibility

Before you can start adding compute nodes of different architectures to your cluster, you must verify that your cluster is multi-architecture compatible.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`)


.Procedure

* You can check that your cluster uses the architecture payload by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release info -o jsonpath="{ .metadata.metadata}"
----

.Verification

. If you see the following output, then your cluster is using the multi-architecture payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
{
 "release.openshift.io/architecture": "multi",
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}
----
You can then begin adding multi-arch compute nodes to your cluster.

. If you see the following output, then your cluster is not using the multi-architecture payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
{
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To migrate your cluster so the cluster supports multi-architecture compute machines, follow the procedure in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/updating_clusters/#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

[id="multi-architecture-creating-arm64-bootimage_{context}"]

= Creating an ARM64 boot image using the Azure image gallery

The following procedure describes how to manually generate an ARM64 boot image.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the Azure CLI (`az`).
* You created a single-architecture Azure installer-provisioned cluster with the multi-architecture installer binary.

.Procedure
. Log in to your Azure account:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az login
----
. Create a storage account and upload the `arm64` virtual hard disk (VHD) to your storage account. The {product-title} installation program creates a resource group, however, the boot image can also be uploaded to a custom named resource group:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az storage account create -n ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} -l westus --sku Standard_LRS <1>
----
+
<1> The `westus` object is an example region.
+
. Create a storage container using the storage account you generated:
+
[source,terminal]
+
----
$ az storage container create -n ${CONTAINER_NAME} --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME}
----
. You must use the {product-title} installation program JSON file to extract the URL and `aarch64` VHD name:
.. Extract the `URL` field and set it to `RHCOS_VHD_ORIGIN_URL` as the file name by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ RHCOS_VHD_ORIGIN_URL=$(oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator get configmap/coreos-bootimages -o jsonpath='{.data.stream}' | jq -r '.architectures.aarch64."rhel-coreos-extensions"."azure-disk".url')
----
.. Extract the `aarch64` VHD name and set it to `BLOB_NAME` as the file name by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ BLOB_NAME=rhcos-$(oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator get configmap/coreos-bootimages -o jsonpath='{.data.stream}' | jq -r '.architectures.aarch64."rhel-coreos-extensions"."azure-disk".release')-azure.aarch64.vhd
----
. Generate a shared access signature (SAS) token. Use this token to upload the {op-system} VHD to your storage container with the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ end=`date -u -d "30 minutes" '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ'`
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sas=`az storage container generate-sas -n ${CONTAINER_NAME} --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} --https-only --permissions dlrw --expiry $end -o tsv`
----
. Copy the {op-system} VHD into the storage container:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az storage blob copy start --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} --sas-token "$sas" \
 --source-uri "${RHCOS_VHD_ORIGIN_URL}" \
 --destination-blob "${BLOB_NAME}" --destination-container ${CONTAINER_NAME}
----
+
You can check the status of the copying process with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az storage blob show -c ${CONTAINER_NAME} -n ${BLOB_NAME} --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} | jq .properties.copy
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
{
 "completionTime": null,
 "destinationSnapshot": null,
 "id": "1fd97630-03ca-489a-8c4e-cfe839c9627d",
 "incrementalCopy": null,
 "progress": "17179869696/17179869696",
 "source": "https://rhcos.blob.core.windows.net/imagebucket/rhcos-411.86.202207130959-0-azure.aarch64.vhd",
 "status": "success", <1>
 "statusDescription": null
}
----
+
<1> If the status parameter displays the `success` object, the copying process is complete.

. Create an image gallery using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az sig create --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --gallery-name ${GALLERY_NAME}
----
Use the image gallery to create an image definition. In the following example command, `rhcos-arm64` is the name of the image definition.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az sig image-definition create --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --gallery-name ${GALLERY_NAME} --gallery-image-definition rhcos-arm64 --publisher RedHat --offer arm --sku arm64 --os-type linux --architecture Arm64 --hyper-v-generation V2
----
. To get the URL of the VHD and set it to `RHCOS_VHD_URL` as the file name, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ RHCOS_VHD_URL=$(az storage blob url --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} -c ${CONTAINER_NAME} -n "${BLOB_NAME}" -o tsv)
----
. Use the `RHCOS_VHD_URL` file, your storage account, resource group, and image gallery to create an image version. In the following example, `1.0.0` is the image version.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az sig image-version create --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --gallery-name ${GALLERY_NAME} --gallery-image-definition rhcos-arm64 --gallery-image-version 1.0.0 --os-vhd-storage-account ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} --os-vhd-uri ${RHCOS_VHD_URL}
----
. Your `arm64` boot image is now generated. You can access the ID of your image with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az sig image-version show -r $GALLERY_NAME -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -i rhcos-arm64 -e 1.0.0
----
The following example image ID is used in the `recourseID` parameter of the compute machine set:
+
.Example `resourceID`
[source,terminal]
----
/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/${GALLERY_NAME}/images/rhcos-arm64/versions/1.0.0

toc::[]

To create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you must first create a single-architecture GCP installer-provisioned cluster with the multi-architecture installer binary. For more information on AWS installations, refer to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/installing/#[Installing a cluster on GCP with customizations]. You can then add ARM64 compute machines sets to your GCP cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Secure booting is currently not supported on ARM64 machines for GCP

toc::[]

To create a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on bare metal, you must have an existing single-architecture bare metal cluster. For more information on bare metal installations, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/installing/#installing-bare-metal[Installing a user provisioned cluster on bare metal]. You can then add 64-bit ARM compute machines to your {product-title} cluster on bare metal.

Before you can add 64-bit ARM nodes to your bare metal cluster, you must upgrade your cluster to one that uses the multi-architecture payload. For more information on migrating to the multi-architecture payload, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/updating_clusters/#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

The following procedures explain how to create a {op-system} compute machine using an ISO image or network PXE booting. This will allow you to add ARM64 nodes to your bare metal cluster and deploy a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines.

[id="multi-architecture-verifying-cluster-compatibility_{context}"]

= Verifying cluster compatibility

Before you can start adding compute nodes of different architectures to your cluster, you must verify that your cluster is multi-architecture compatible.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`)


.Procedure

* You can check that your cluster uses the architecture payload by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release info -o jsonpath="{ .metadata.metadata}"
----

.Verification

. If you see the following output, then your cluster is using the multi-architecture payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
{
 "release.openshift.io/architecture": "multi",
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}
----
You can then begin adding multi-arch compute nodes to your cluster.

. If you see the following output, then your cluster is not using the multi-architecture payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
{
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To migrate your cluster so the cluster supports multi-architecture compute machines, follow the procedure in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/updating_clusters/#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

[id="machine-user-infra-machines-iso_{context}"]
= Creating {op-system} machines using an ISO image

You can create more {op-system-first} compute machines for your bare metal cluster by using an ISO image to create the machines.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the URL of the Ignition config file for the compute machines for your cluster. You uploaded this file to your HTTP server during installation.
* You must have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`)  installed.

.Procedure

. Extract the Ignition config file from the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc extract -n openshift-machine-api secret/worker-user-data-managed --keys=userData --to=- > worker.ign
----

. Upload the `worker.ign` Ignition config file you exported from your cluster to your HTTP server. Note the URLs of these files.

. You can validate that the ignition files are available on the URLs. The following example gets the Ignition config files for the compute node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -k http://<HTTP_server>/worker.ign
----

. You can access the ISO image for booting your new machine by running to following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
RHCOS_VHD_ORIGIN_URL=$(oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator get configmap/coreos-bootimages -o jsonpath='{.data.stream}' | jq -r '.architectures.<architecture>.artifacts.metal.formats.iso.disk.location')
----

. Use the ISO file to install {op-system} on more compute machines. Use the same method that you used when you created machines before you installed the cluster:
** Burn the ISO image to a disk and boot it directly.
** Use ISO redirection with a LOM interface.

. Boot the {op-system} ISO image without specifying any options, or interrupting the live boot sequence. Wait for the installer to boot into a shell prompt in the {op-system} live environment.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can interrupt the {op-system} installation boot process to add kernel arguments. However, for this ISO procedure you must use the `coreos-installer` command as outlined in the following steps, instead of adding kernel arguments.
====

. Run the `coreos-installer` command and specify the options that meet your installation requirements. At a minimum, you must specify the URL that points to the Ignition config file for the node type, and the device that you are installing to:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo coreos-installer install --ignition-url=http://<HTTP_server>/<node_type>.ign <device> --ignition-hash=sha512-<digest> <1><2>
----
<1> You must run the `coreos-installer` command by using `sudo`, because the `core` user does not have the required root privileges to perform the installation.
<2> The `--ignition-hash` option is required when the Ignition config file is obtained through an HTTP URL to validate the authenticity of the Ignition config file on the cluster node. `<digest>` is the Ignition config file SHA512 digest obtained in a preceding step.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to provide your Ignition config files through an HTTPS server that uses TLS, you can add the internal certificate authority (CA) to the system trust store before running `coreos-installer`.
====
+
The following example initializes a bootstrap node installation to the `/dev/sda` device. The Ignition config file for the bootstrap node is obtained from an HTTP web server with the IP address 192.168.1.2:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo coreos-installer install --ignition-url=http://192.168.1.2:80/installation_directory/bootstrap.ign /dev/sda --ignition-hash=sha512-a5a2d43879223273c9b60af66b44202a1d1248fc01cf156c46d4a79f552b6bad47bc8cc78ddf0116e80c59d2ea9e32ba53bc807afbca581aa059311def2c3e3b
----

. Monitor the progress of the {op-system} installation on the console of the machine.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the installation is successful on each node before commencing with the {product-title} installation. Observing the installation process can also help to determine the cause of {op-system} installation issues that might arise.
====

. Continue to create more compute machines for your cluster.

[id="machine-user-infra-machines-pxe_{context}"]
= Creating {op-system} machines by PXE or iPXE booting

You can create more {op-system-first} compute machines for your bare metal cluster by using PXE or iPXE booting.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the URL of the Ignition config file for the compute machines for your cluster. You uploaded this file to your HTTP server during installation.
* Obtain the URLs of the {op-system} ISO image, compressed metal BIOS, `kernel`, and `initramfs` files that you uploaded to your HTTP server during cluster installation.
* You have access to the PXE booting infrastructure that you used to create the machines for your {product-title} cluster during installation. The machines must boot from their local disks after {op-system} is installed on them.
* If you use UEFI, you have access to the `grub.conf` file that you modified during {product-title} installation.

.Procedure

. Confirm that your PXE or iPXE installation for the {op-system} images is correct.

** For PXE:

----
<1> Specify the location of the live `kernel` file that you uploaded to your HTTP server.
<2> Specify locations of the {op-system} files that you uploaded to your HTTP server. The `initrd` parameter value is the location of the live `initramfs` file, the `coreos.inst.ignition_url` parameter value is the location of the worker Ignition config file, and the `coreos.live.rootfs_url` parameter value is the location of the live `rootfs` file. The `coreos.inst.ignition_url` and `coreos.live.rootfs_url` parameters only support HTTP and HTTPS.
+
[NOTE]
====
This configuration does not enable serial console access on machines with a graphical console. To configure a different console, add one or more `console=` arguments to the `APPEND` line. For example, add `console=tty0 console=ttyS0` to set the first PC serial port as the primary console and the graphical console as a secondary console. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7212[How does one set up a serial terminal and/or console in Red Hat Enterprise Linux?].

and the `coreos.inst.ignition_url` parameter value is the
location of the worker Ignition config file.
<2> If you use multiple NICs, specify a single interface in the `ip` option.
For example, to use DHCP on a NIC that is named `eno1`, set `ip=eno1:dhcp`.
<3> Specify the location of the `initramfs` file that you uploaded to your HTTP server.
+
[NOTE]
====
This configuration does not enable serial console access on machines with a graphical console To configure a different console, add one or more `console=` arguments to the `kernel` line. For example, add `console=tty0 console=ttyS0` to set the first PC serial port as the primary console and the graphical console as a secondary console.

====
+
[NOTE]
====
To network boot the CoreOS `kernel` on `aarch64` architecture, you need to use a version of iPXE build with the `IMAGE_GZIP` option enabled. See link:https://ipxe.org/buildcfg/image_gzip[`IMAGE_GZIP` option in iPXE].
====

** For PXE (with UEFI and GRUB as second stage) on `aarch64`:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  63m  v1.28.5
master-1  Ready     master  63m  v1.28.5
master-2  Ready     master  64m  v1.28.5
----
+
The output lists all of the machines that you created.
+
[NOTE]
====
The preceding output might not include the compute nodes, also known as worker nodes, until some CSRs are approved.
====

. Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the `Pending` or `Approved` status for each machine that you added to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-8b2br   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
csr-8vnps   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
...
----
+
In this example, two machines are joining the cluster. You might see more approved CSRs in the list.

. If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:
+
[NOTE]
====
Because the CSRs rotate automatically, approve your CSRs within an hour of adding the machines to the cluster. If you do not approve them within an hour, the certificates will rotate, and more than two certificates will be present for each node. You must approve all of these certificates. After the client CSR is approved, the Kubelet creates a secondary CSR for the serving certificate, which requires manual approval. Then, subsequent serving certificate renewal requests are automatically approved by the `machine-approver` if the Kubelet requests a new certificate with identical parameters.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
For clusters running on platforms that are not machine API enabled, such as bare metal and other user-provisioned infrastructure, you must implement a method of automatically approving the kubelet serving certificate requests (CSRs). If a request is not approved, then the `oc exec`, `oc rsh`, and `oc logs` commands cannot succeed, because a serving certificate is required when the API server connects to the kubelet. Any operation that contacts the Kubelet endpoint requires this certificate approval to be in place. The method must watch for new CSRs, confirm that the CSR was submitted by the `node-bootstrapper` service account in the `system:node` or `system:admin` groups, and confirm the identity of the node.
====

** To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

** To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Some Operators might not become available until some CSRs are approved.
====

. Now that your client requests are approved, you must review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-bfd72   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-50-126.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
csr-c57lv   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-95-157.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
...
----

. If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

** To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

** To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
----

. After all client and server CSRs have been approved, the machines have the `Ready` status. Verify this by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  73m  v1.28.5
master-1  Ready     master  73m  v1.28.5
master-2  Ready     master  74m  v1.28.5
worker-0  Ready     worker  11m  v1.28.5
worker-1  Ready     worker  11m  v1.28.5
----
+
[NOTE]
====
It can take a few minutes after approval of the server CSRs for the machines to transition to the `Ready` status.

toc::[]

To create a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name} (`s390x`) with z/VM, you must have an existing single-architecture `x86_64` cluster. You can then add `s390x` compute machines to your {product-title} cluster.

Before you can add `s390x` nodes to your cluster, you must upgrade your cluster to one that uses the multi-architecture payload. For more information on migrating to the multi-architecture payload, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/updating_clusters/#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

The following procedures explain how to create a {op-system} compute machine using a z/VM instance. This will allow you to add `s390x` nodes to your cluster and deploy a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="multi-architecture-verifying-cluster-compatibility_{context}"]

= Verifying cluster compatibility

Before you can start adding compute nodes of different architectures to your cluster, you must verify that your cluster is multi-architecture compatible.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`)


.Procedure

* You can check that your cluster uses the architecture payload by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release info -o jsonpath="{ .metadata.metadata}"
----

.Verification

. If you see the following output, then your cluster is using the multi-architecture payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
{
 "release.openshift.io/architecture": "multi",
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}
----
You can then begin adding multi-arch compute nodes to your cluster.

. If you see the following output, then your cluster is not using the multi-architecture payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
{
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To migrate your cluster so the cluster supports multi-architecture compute machines, follow the procedure in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/updating_clusters/#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="machine-user-infra-machines-ibm-z_{context}"]
= Creating {op-system} machines on {ibm-z-title} with z/VM

You can create more {op-system-first} compute machines running on {ibm-z-name} with z/VM and attach them to your existing cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have a domain name server (DNS) that can perform hostname and reverse lookup for the nodes.
* You have an HTTP or HTTPS server running on your provisioning machine that is accessible to the machines you create.

.Procedure
// Step 1 is a workaround for https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18394
// Can be removed when bug is fixed.
. Disable UDP aggregation.
+
Currently, UDP aggregation is not supported on {ibm-z-name} and is not automatically deactivated on multi-architecture compute clusters with an `x86_64` control plane and additional `s390x` compute machines. To ensure that the addtional compute nodes are added to the cluster correctly, you must manually disable UDP aggregation.

.. Create a YAML file `udp-aggregation-config.yaml` with the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
data:
  disable-udp-aggregation: "true"
metadata:
  name: udp-aggregation-config
  namespace: openshift-network-operator
----

.. Create the ConfigMap resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f udp-aggregation-config.yaml
----

. Extract the Ignition config file from the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc extract -n openshift-machine-api secret/worker-user-data-managed --keys=userData --to=- > worker.ign
----

. Upload the `worker.ign` Ignition config file you exported from your cluster to your HTTP server. Note the URL of this file.

. You can validate that the Ignition file is available on the URL. The following example gets the Ignition config file for the compute node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -k http://<HTTP_server>/worker.ign
----

. Download the {op-system-base} live `kernel`, `initramfs`, and `rootfs` files by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -LO $(oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator get configmap/coreos-bootimages -o jsonpath='{.data.stream}' \
| jq -r '.architectures.s390x.artifacts.metal.formats.pxe.kernel.location')
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -LO $(oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator get configmap/coreos-bootimages -o jsonpath='{.data.stream}' \
| jq -r '.architectures.s390x.artifacts.metal.formats.pxe.initramfs.location')
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -LO $(oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator get configmap/coreos-bootimages -o jsonpath='{.data.stream}' \
| jq -r '.architectures.s390x.artifacts.metal.formats.pxe.rootfs.location')
----

. Move the downloaded {op-system-base} live `kernel`, `initramfs`, and `rootfs` files to an HTTP or HTTPS server that is accessible from the z/VM guest you want to add.

. Create a parameter file for the z/VM guest. The following parameters are specific for the virtual machine:
** Optional: To specify a static IP address, add an `ip=` parameter with the following entries, with each separated by a colon:
... The IP address for the machine.
... An empty string.
... The gateway.
... The netmask.
... The machine host and domain name in the form `hostname.domainname`. Omit this value to let {op-system} decide.
... The network interface name. Omit this value to let {op-system} decide.
... The value `none`.
** For `coreos.inst.ignition_url=`, specify the URL to the `worker.ign` file. Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.
** For `coreos.live.rootfs_url=`, specify the matching rootfs artifact for the `kernel` and `initramfs` you are booting. Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.

** For installations on DASD-type disks, complete the following tasks:
... For `coreos.inst.install_dev=`, specify `/dev/dasda`.
... Use `rd.dasd=` to specify the DASD where {op-system} is to be installed.
... Leave all other parameters unchanged.
+
The following is an example parameter file, `additional-worker-dasd.parm`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
rd.neednet=1 \
console=ttysclp0 \
coreos.inst.install_dev=/dev/dasda \
coreos.live.rootfs_url=http://cl1.provide.example.com:8080/assets/rhcos-live-rootfs.s390x.img \
coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://cl1.provide.example.com:8080/ignition/worker.ign \

zfcp.allow_lun_scan=0 \
rd.dasd=0.0.3490
----
+
Write all options in the parameter file as a single line and make sure that you have no newline characters.

** For installations on FCP-type disks, complete the following tasks:
... Use `rd.zfcp=<adapter>,<wwpn>,<lun>` to specify the FCP disk where {op-system} is to be installed. For multipathing, repeat this step for each additional path.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you install with multiple paths, you must enable multipathing directly after the installation, not at a later point in time, as this can cause problems.
====
... Set the install device as: `coreos.inst.install_dev=/dev/sda`.
+
[NOTE]
====
If additional LUNs are configured with NPIV, FCP requires `zfcp.allow_lun_scan=0`. If you must enable `zfcp.allow_lun_scan=1` because you use a CSI driver, for example, you must configure your NPIV so that each node cannot access the boot partition of another node.
====
... Leave all other parameters unchanged.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Additional postinstallation steps are required to fully enable multipathing. For more information, see “Enabling multipathing with kernel arguments on {op-system}" in _Postinstallation machine configuration tasks_.
====
// Add xref once it's allowed.
+
The following is an example parameter file, `additional-worker-fcp.parm` for a worker node with multipathing:

----
+
Write all options in the parameter file as a single line and make sure that you have no newline characters.

. Transfer the `initramfs`, `kernel`, parameter files, and {op-system} images to z/VM, for example, by using FTP. For details about how to transfer the files with FTP and boot from the virtual reader, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/installation_guide/sect-installing-zvm-s390[Installing under Z/VM].

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="installation-approve-csrs_{context}"]
= Approving the certificate signing requests for your machines

When you add machines to a cluster, two pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) are generated for each machine that you added. You must confirm that these CSRs are approved or, if necessary, approve them yourself. The client requests must be approved first, followed by the server requests.

.Prerequisites

* You added machines to your cluster.

.Procedure

. Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  63m  v1.28.5
master-1  Ready     master  63m  v1.28.5
master-2  Ready     master  64m  v1.28.5
----
+
The output lists all of the machines that you created.
+
[NOTE]
====
The preceding output might not include the compute nodes, also known as worker nodes, until some CSRs are approved.
====

. Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the `Pending` or `Approved` status for each machine that you added to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-8b2br   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
csr-8vnps   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
...
----
+
In this example, two machines are joining the cluster. You might see more approved CSRs in the list.

. If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:
+
[NOTE]
====
Because the CSRs rotate automatically, approve your CSRs within an hour of adding the machines to the cluster. If you do not approve them within an hour, the certificates will rotate, and more than two certificates will be present for each node. You must approve all of these certificates. After the client CSR is approved, the Kubelet creates a secondary CSR for the serving certificate, which requires manual approval. Then, subsequent serving certificate renewal requests are automatically approved by the `machine-approver` if the Kubelet requests a new certificate with identical parameters.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
For clusters running on platforms that are not machine API enabled, such as bare metal and other user-provisioned infrastructure, you must implement a method of automatically approving the kubelet serving certificate requests (CSRs). If a request is not approved, then the `oc exec`, `oc rsh`, and `oc logs` commands cannot succeed, because a serving certificate is required when the API server connects to the kubelet. Any operation that contacts the Kubelet endpoint requires this certificate approval to be in place. The method must watch for new CSRs, confirm that the CSR was submitted by the `node-bootstrapper` service account in the `system:node` or `system:admin` groups, and confirm the identity of the node.
====

** To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

** To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Some Operators might not become available until some CSRs are approved.
====

. Now that your client requests are approved, you must review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-bfd72   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-50-126.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
csr-c57lv   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-95-157.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
...
----

. If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

** To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

** To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
----

. After all client and server CSRs have been approved, the machines have the `Ready` status. Verify this by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  73m  v1.28.5
master-1  Ready     master  73m  v1.28.5
master-2  Ready     master  74m  v1.28.5
worker-0  Ready     worker  11m  v1.28.5
worker-1  Ready     worker  11m  v1.28.5
----
+
[NOTE]
====
It can take a few minutes after approval of the server CSRs for the machines to transition to the `Ready` status.
====

toc::[]

To create a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name} (`s390x`) with {op-system-base} KVM, you must have an existing single-architecture `x86_64` cluster. You can then add `s390x` compute machines to your {product-title} cluster.

Before you can add `s390x` nodes to your cluster, you must upgrade your cluster to one that uses the multi-architecture payload. For more information on migrating to the multi-architecture payload, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/updating_clusters/#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

The following procedures explain how to create a {op-system} compute machine using a {op-system-base} KVM instance. This will allow you to add `s390x` nodes to your cluster and deploy a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines.

[id="multi-architecture-verifying-cluster-compatibility_{context}"]

= Verifying cluster compatibility

Before you can start adding compute nodes of different architectures to your cluster, you must verify that your cluster is multi-architecture compatible.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`)


.Procedure

* You can check that your cluster uses the architecture payload by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release info -o jsonpath="{ .metadata.metadata}"
----

.Verification

. If you see the following output, then your cluster is using the multi-architecture payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
{
 "release.openshift.io/architecture": "multi",
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}
----
You can then begin adding multi-arch compute nodes to your cluster.

. If you see the following output, then your cluster is not using the multi-architecture payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
{
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To migrate your cluster so the cluster supports multi-architecture compute machines, follow the procedure in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/updating_clusters/#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="machine-user-infra-machines-ibm-z-kvm_{context}"]
= Creating {op-system} machines using `virt-install`

You can create more {op-system-first} compute machines for your cluster by using `virt-install`.

.Prerequisites

* You have at least one LPAR running on {op-system-base} 8.7 or later with KVM, referred to as {op-system-base} KVM host in this procedure.
* The KVM/QEMU hypervisor is installed on the {op-system-base} KVM host.
* You have a domain name server (DNS) that can perform hostname and reverse lookup for the nodes.
* An HTTP or HTTPS server is set up.

.Procedure
// Step 1 is a workaround for https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18394
// Can be removed when bug is fixed.
. Disable UDP aggregation.
+
Currently, UDP aggregation is not supported on {ibm-z-name} and is not automatically deactivated on multi-architecture compute clusters with an `x86_64` control plane and additional `s390x` compute machines. To ensure that the addtional compute nodes are added to the cluster correctly, you must manually disable UDP aggregation.

.. Create a YAML file `udp-aggregation-config.yaml` with the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
data:
  disable-udp-aggregation: "true"
metadata:
  name: udp-aggregation-config
  namespace: openshift-network-operator
----

.. Create the ConfigMap resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f udp-aggregation-config.yaml
----

. Extract the Ignition config file from the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc extract -n openshift-machine-api secret/worker-user-data-managed --keys=userData --to=- > worker.ign
----

. Upload the `worker.ign` Ignition config file you exported from your cluster to your HTTP server. Note the URL of this file.

. You can validate that the Ignition file is available on the URL. The following example gets the Ignition config file for the compute node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -k http://<HTTP_server>/worker.ign
----

. Download the {op-system-base} live `kernel`, `initramfs`, and `rootfs` files by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 $ curl -LO $(oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator get configmap/coreos-bootimages -o jsonpath='{.data.stream}' \
| jq -r '.architectures.s390x.artifacts.metal.formats.pxe.kernel.location')
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -LO $(oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator get configmap/coreos-bootimages -o jsonpath='{.data.stream}' \
| jq -r '.architectures.s390x.artifacts.metal.formats.pxe.initramfs.location')
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -LO $(oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator get configmap/coreos-bootimages -o jsonpath='{.data.stream}' \
| jq -r '.architectures.s390x.artifacts.metal.formats.pxe.rootfs.location')
----

. Move the downloaded {op-system-base} live `kernel`, `initramfs` and `rootfs` files to an HTTP or HTTPS server before you launch `virt-install`.

. Create the new KVM guest nodes using the {op-system-base} `kernel`, `initramfs`, and Ignition files; the new disk image; and adjusted parm line arguments.

[id="installation-approve-csrs_{context}"]
= Approving the certificate signing requests for your machines

When you add machines to a cluster, two pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) are generated for each machine that you added. You must confirm that these CSRs are approved or, if necessary, approve them yourself. The client requests must be approved first, followed by the server requests.

.Prerequisites

* You added machines to your cluster.

.Procedure

. Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  63m  v1.28.5
master-1  Ready     master  63m  v1.28.5
master-2  Ready     master  64m  v1.28.5
----
+
The output lists all of the machines that you created.
+
[NOTE]
====
The preceding output might not include the compute nodes, also known as worker nodes, until some CSRs are approved.
====

. Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the `Pending` or `Approved` status for each machine that you added to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-8b2br   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
csr-8vnps   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
...
----
+
In this example, two machines are joining the cluster. You might see more approved CSRs in the list.

. If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:
+
[NOTE]
====
Because the CSRs rotate automatically, approve your CSRs within an hour of adding the machines to the cluster. If you do not approve them within an hour, the certificates will rotate, and more than two certificates will be present for each node. You must approve all of these certificates. After the client CSR is approved, the Kubelet creates a secondary CSR for the serving certificate, which requires manual approval. Then, subsequent serving certificate renewal requests are automatically approved by the `machine-approver` if the Kubelet requests a new certificate with identical parameters.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
For clusters running on platforms that are not machine API enabled, such as bare metal and other user-provisioned infrastructure, you must implement a method of automatically approving the kubelet serving certificate requests (CSRs). If a request is not approved, then the `oc exec`, `oc rsh`, and `oc logs` commands cannot succeed, because a serving certificate is required when the API server connects to the kubelet. Any operation that contacts the Kubelet endpoint requires this certificate approval to be in place. The method must watch for new CSRs, confirm that the CSR was submitted by the `node-bootstrapper` service account in the `system:node` or `system:admin` groups, and confirm the identity of the node.
====

** To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

** To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Some Operators might not become available until some CSRs are approved.
====

. Now that your client requests are approved, you must review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-bfd72   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-50-126.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
csr-c57lv   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-95-157.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
...
----

. If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

** To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

** To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
----

. After all client and server CSRs have been approved, the machines have the `Ready` status. Verify this by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  73m  v1.28.5
master-1  Ready     master  73m  v1.28.5
master-2  Ready     master  74m  v1.28.5
worker-0  Ready     worker  11m  v1.28.5
worker-1  Ready     worker  11m  v1.28.5
----
+
[NOTE]
====
It can take a few minutes after approval of the server CSRs for the machines to transition to the `Ready` status.
====

toc::[]

To create a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), you must have an existing single-architecture (`x86_64`) cluster. You can then add `ppc64le` compute machines to your {product-title} cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you can add `ppc64le` nodes to your cluster, you must upgrade your cluster to one that uses the multi-architecture payload. For more information on migrating to the multi-architecture payload, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/updating_clusters/#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].
====

The following procedures explain how to create a {op-system} compute machine using an ISO image or network PXE booting. This will allow you to add `ppc64le` nodes to your cluster and deploy a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines.

[id="multi-architecture-verifying-cluster-compatibility_{context}"]

= Verifying cluster compatibility

Before you can start adding compute nodes of different architectures to your cluster, you must verify that your cluster is multi-architecture compatible.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`)

[NOTE]
====
When using multiple architectures, hosts for {product-title} nodes must share the same storage layer. If they do not have the same storage layer, use a storage provider such as `nfs-provisioner`.
====

[NOTE]
====
You should limit the number of network hops between the compute and control plane as much as possible.
====

.Procedure

* You can check that your cluster uses the architecture payload by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release info -o jsonpath="{ .metadata.metadata}"
----

.Verification

. If you see the following output, then your cluster is using the multi-architecture payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
{
 "release.openshift.io/architecture": "multi",
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}
----
You can then begin adding multi-arch compute nodes to your cluster.

. If you see the following output, then your cluster is not using the multi-architecture payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
{
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To migrate your cluster so the cluster supports multi-architecture compute machines, follow the procedure in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/updating_clusters/#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

[id="machine-user-infra-machines-iso_{context}"]
= Creating {op-system} machines using an ISO image

You can create more {op-system-first} compute machines for your cluster by using an ISO image to create the machines.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the URL of the Ignition config file for the compute machines for your cluster. You uploaded this file to your HTTP server during installation.
* You must have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`)  installed.

.Procedure

. Extract the Ignition config file from the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc extract -n openshift-machine-api secret/worker-user-data-managed --keys=userData --to=- > worker.ign
----

. Upload the `worker.ign` Ignition config file you exported from your cluster to your HTTP server. Note the URLs of these files.

. You can validate that the ignition files are available on the URLs. The following example gets the Ignition config files for the compute node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -k http://<HTTP_server>/worker.ign
----

. You can access the ISO image for booting your new machine by running to following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
RHCOS_VHD_ORIGIN_URL=$(oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator get configmap/coreos-bootimages -o jsonpath='{.data.stream}' | jq -r '.architectures.<architecture>.artifacts.metal.formats.iso.disk.location')
----

. Use the ISO file to install {op-system} on more compute machines. Use the same method that you used when you created machines before you installed the cluster:
** Burn the ISO image to a disk and boot it directly.
** Use ISO redirection with a LOM interface.

. Boot the {op-system} ISO image without specifying any options, or interrupting the live boot sequence. Wait for the installer to boot into a shell prompt in the {op-system} live environment.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can interrupt the {op-system} installation boot process to add kernel arguments. However, for this ISO procedure you must use the `coreos-installer` command as outlined in the following steps, instead of adding kernel arguments.
====

. Run the `coreos-installer` command and specify the options that meet your installation requirements. At a minimum, you must specify the URL that points to the Ignition config file for the node type, and the device that you are installing to:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo coreos-installer install --ignition-url=http://<HTTP_server>/<node_type>.ign <device> --ignition-hash=sha512-<digest> <1><2>
----
<1> You must run the `coreos-installer` command by using `sudo`, because the `core` user does not have the required root privileges to perform the installation.
<2> The `--ignition-hash` option is required when the Ignition config file is obtained through an HTTP URL to validate the authenticity of the Ignition config file on the cluster node. `<digest>` is the Ignition config file SHA512 digest obtained in a preceding step.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to provide your Ignition config files through an HTTPS server that uses TLS, you can add the internal certificate authority (CA) to the system trust store before running `coreos-installer`.
====
+
The following example initializes a bootstrap node installation to the `/dev/sda` device. The Ignition config file for the bootstrap node is obtained from an HTTP web server with the IP address 192.168.1.2:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo coreos-installer install --ignition-url=http://192.168.1.2:80/installation_directory/bootstrap.ign /dev/sda --ignition-hash=sha512-a5a2d43879223273c9b60af66b44202a1d1248fc01cf156c46d4a79f552b6bad47bc8cc78ddf0116e80c59d2ea9e32ba53bc807afbca581aa059311def2c3e3b
----

. Monitor the progress of the {op-system} installation on the console of the machine.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the installation is successful on each node before commencing with the {product-title} installation. Observing the installation process can also help to determine the cause of {op-system} installation issues that might arise.
====

. Continue to create more compute machines for your cluster.

You can create more {op-system-first} compute machines for your bare metal cluster by using PXE or iPXE booting.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the URL of the Ignition config file for the compute machines for your cluster. You uploaded this file to your HTTP server during installation.
* Obtain the URLs of the {op-system} ISO image, compressed metal BIOS, `kernel`, and `initramfs` files that you uploaded to your HTTP server during cluster installation.
* You have access to the PXE booting infrastructure that you used to create the machines for your {product-title} cluster during installation. The machines must boot from their local disks after {op-system} is installed on them.
* If you use UEFI, you have access to the `grub.conf` file that you modified during {product-title} installation.

.Procedure

. Confirm that your PXE or iPXE installation for the {op-system} images is correct.

** For PXE:

----
<1> Specify the location of the live `kernel` file that you uploaded to your HTTP server.
<2> Specify locations of the {op-system} files that you uploaded to your HTTP server. The `initrd` parameter value is the location of the live `initramfs` file, the `coreos.inst.ignition_url` parameter value is the location of the worker Ignition config file, and the `coreos.live.rootfs_url` parameter value is the location of the live `rootfs` file. The `coreos.inst.ignition_url` and `coreos.live.rootfs_url` parameters only support HTTP and HTTPS.
+
[NOTE]
====
This configuration does not enable serial console access on machines with a graphical console. To configure a different console, add one or more `console=` arguments to the `APPEND` line. For example, add `console=tty0 console=ttyS0` to set the first PC serial port as the primary console and the graphical console as a secondary console. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7212[How does one set up a serial terminal and/or console in Red Hat Enterprise Linux?].

[id="installation-approve-csrs_{context}"]
= Approving the certificate signing requests for your machines

When you add machines to a cluster, two pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) are generated for each machine that you added. You must confirm that these CSRs are approved or, if necessary, approve them yourself. The client requests must be approved first, followed by the server requests.

.Prerequisites

* You added machines to your cluster.

.Procedure

. Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  63m  v1.28.5
master-1  Ready     master  63m  v1.28.5
master-2  Ready     master  64m  v1.28.5
----
+
The output lists all of the machines that you created.
+
[NOTE]
====
The preceding output might not include the compute nodes, also known as worker nodes, until some CSRs are approved.
====

. Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the `Pending` or `Approved` status for each machine that you added to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-8b2br   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
csr-8vnps   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
...
----
+
In this example, two machines are joining the cluster. You might see more approved CSRs in the list.

. If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:
+
[NOTE]
====
Because the CSRs rotate automatically, approve your CSRs within an hour of adding the machines to the cluster. If you do not approve them within an hour, the certificates will rotate, and more than two certificates will be present for each node. You must approve all of these certificates. After the client CSR is approved, the Kubelet creates a secondary CSR for the serving certificate, which requires manual approval. Then, subsequent serving certificate renewal requests are automatically approved by the `machine-approver` if the Kubelet requests a new certificate with identical parameters.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
For clusters running on platforms that are not machine API enabled, such as bare metal and other user-provisioned infrastructure, you must implement a method of automatically approving the kubelet serving certificate requests (CSRs). If a request is not approved, then the `oc exec`, `oc rsh`, and `oc logs` commands cannot succeed, because a serving certificate is required when the API server connects to the kubelet. Any operation that contacts the Kubelet endpoint requires this certificate approval to be in place. The method must watch for new CSRs, confirm that the CSR was submitted by the `node-bootstrapper` service account in the `system:node` or `system:admin` groups, and confirm the identity of the node.
====

** To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

** To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Some Operators might not become available until some CSRs are approved.
====

. Now that your client requests are approved, you must review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-bfd72   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-50-126.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
csr-c57lv   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-95-157.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
...
----

. If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

** To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

** To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
----

. After all client and server CSRs have been approved, the machines have the `Ready` status. Verify this by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes -o wide
----
+

== Scheduling workloads on clusters with multi-architecture compute machines

Deploying a workload on a cluster with compute nodes of different architectures requires attention and monitoring of your cluster. There might be further actions you need to take in order to successfully place pods in the nodes of your cluster.

For more detailed information on node affinity, scheduling, taints and tolerlations, see the following documentatinon:

= Sample multi-architecture node workload deployments

Before you schedule workloads on a cluster with compute nodes of different architectures, consider the following use cases:

Using node affinity to schedule workloads on a node:: You can allow a workload to be scheduled on only a set of nodes with architectures supported by its images, you can set the `spec.affinity.nodeAffinity` field in your pod's template specification.
+

              - key: kubernetes.io/arch
                operator: In
                values: <1>
                - amd64
                - arm64
----
<1> Specify the supported architectures. Valid values include `amd64`,`arm64`, or both values.

Tainting every node for a specific architecture:: You can taint a node to avoid workloads that are not compatible with its architecture to be scheduled on that node. In the case where your cluster is using a `MachineSet` object, you can add parameters to the `.spec.template.spec.taints` field to avoid workloads being scheduled on nodes with non-supported architectures.

* Before you can taint a node, you must scale down the `MachineSet` object or remove available machines. You can scale down the machine set by using one of following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=0 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
For more information on scaling machine sets, see "Modifying a compute machine set".

+

      taints:
      - effect: NoSchedule
        key: multi-arch.openshift.io/arch
        value: arm64
----
You can also set a taint on a specific node by running the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> multi-arch.openshift.io/arch=arm64:NoSchedule
----
--

Creating a default toleration:: You can annotate a namespace so all of the workloads get the same default toleration by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate namespace my-namespace \
  'scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultTolerations'='[{"operator": "Exists", "effect": "NoSchedule", "key": "multi-arch.openshift.io/arch"}]'
----

Tolerating architecture taints in workloads:: On a node with a defined taint, workloads will not be scheduled on that node. However, you can allow them to be scheduled by setting a toleration in the pod's specification.
+
.Example deployment with a toleration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: # ...
spec:
  # ...
  template:
    # ...

        value: "arm64"
        operator: "Equal"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
----
+
This example deployment can also be allowed on nodes with the `multi-arch.openshift.io/arch=arm64` taint specified.

Using node affinity with taints and tolerations:: When a scheduler computes the set of nodes to schedule a pod, tolerations can broaden the set while node affinity restricts the set. If you set a taint to the nodes of a specific architecture, the following example toleration is required for scheduling pods.

[id="multi-architecture-enabling-64k-pages_{context}"]

= Enabling 64k pages on the {op-system-first} kernel

You can enable the 64k memory page in the {op-system-first} kernel on the 64-bit ARM compute machines in your cluster. The 64k page size kernel specification can be used for large GPU or high memory workloads. This is done using the Machine Config Operator (MCO) which uses a machine config pool to update the kernel. To enable 64k page sizes, you must dedicate a machine config pool for ARM64 to enable on the kernel.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using 64k pages is exclusive to 64-bit ARM architecture compute nodes or clusters installed on 64-bit ARM machines. If you configure the 64k pages kernel on a machine config pool using 64-bit x86 machines, the machine config pool and MCO will degrade.
====

.Prerequisites:
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You created a cluster with compute nodes of different architecture on one of the supported platforms.

.Procedure:

. Label the nodes where you want to run the 64k page size kernel:
[source,terminal]
+
----
$ oc label node <node_name> <label>
----
+
.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node worker-arm64-01 node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-64k-pages=
----

. Create a machine config pool that contains the worker role that uses the ARM64 architecture and the `worker-64k-pages` role:
[source,yaml]
+
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  name: worker-64k-pages
spec:
  machineConfigSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role
        operator: In
        values:
        - worker
        - worker-64k-pages
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-64k-pages: ""
      kubernetes.io/arch: arm64
----

. Create a machine config on your compute node to enable `64k-pages` with the `64k-pages` parameter.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <filename>.yaml
----
+
.Example MachineConfig
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: "worker-64k-pages" <1>
  name: 99-worker-64kpages
spec:
  kernelType: 64k-pages <2>
----
<1> Specify the value of the `machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role` label in the custom machine config pool. The example MachineConfig uses the `worker-64k-pages` label to enable 64k pages in the `worker-64k-pages` pool.
<2> Specify your desired kernel type. Valid values are `64k-pages` and `default`
+
[NOTE]
====
The `64k-pages` type is supported on only 64-bit ARM architecture based compute nodes. The `realtime` type is supported on only 64-bit x86 architecture based compute nodes.
====

.Verification

* To view your new `worker-64k-pages` machine config pool, run the following command:

= Importing manifest lists in image streams on your multi-architecture compute machines

On an {product-title} {product-version} cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, the image streams in the cluster do not import manifest lists automatically. You must manually change the default `importMode` option to the `PreserveOriginal` option in order to import the manifest list.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the {product-title} CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

* The following example command shows how to patch the `ImageStream` cli-artifacts so that the `cli-artifacts:latest` image stream tag is imported as a manifest list.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch is/cli-artifacts -n openshift -p '{"spec":{"tags":[{"name":"latest","importPolicy":{"importMode":"PreserveOriginal"}}]}}'
----

.Verification

* You can check that the manifest lists imported properly by inspecting the image stream tag. The following command will list the individual architecture manifests for a particular tag.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get istag cli-artifacts:latest -n openshift -oyaml
----

+
If the `dockerImageManifests` object is present, then the manifest list import was successful.

:context: installing-vsphere-post-installation-configuration


After installing an {product-title} cluster on vSphere with the platform integration feature enabled, you might need to update the vSphere connection settings manually, depending on the installation method.

For installations using the Assisted Installer, you must update the connection settings. This is because the Assisted Installer adds default connection settings to the *vSphere connection configuration* wizard as placeholders during the installation.

For installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure installations, you should have entered valid connection settings during the installation. You can use the *vSphere connection configuration* wizard at any time to validate or modify the connection settings, but this is not mandatory for completing the installation.

toc::[]

:leveloffset: +1

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-post-installation-configuration.adoc

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="configuring-vSphere-connection-settings_{context}"]
= Configuring the vSphere connection settings

[role="_abstract"]
Modify the following vSphere configuration settings as required:

* vCenter address
* vCenter cluster
* vCenter username
* vCenter password
* vCenter address
* vSphere data center
* vSphere datastore
* Virtual machine folder

.Prerequisites
* The {ai-full} has finished installing the cluster successfully.
* The cluster is connected to `https://console.redhat.com`.

.Procedure
. In the Administrator perspective, navigate to *Home -> Overview*.
. Under *Status*, click *vSphere connection* to open the *vSphere connection configuration* wizard.
. In the *vCenter* field, enter the network address of the vSphere vCenter server. This can be either a domain name or an IP address. It appears in the vSphere web client URL; for example `https://[your_vCenter_address]/ui`.
. In the *vCenter cluster* field, enter the name of the vSphere vCenter cluster where {product-title} is installed.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
This step is mandatory if you installed {product-title} 4.13 or later.
====

. In the *Username* field, enter your vSphere vCenter username.
. In the *Password* field, enter your vSphere vCenter password.
+
[WARNING]
====
The system stores the username and password in the `vsphere-creds` secret in the `kube-system` namespace of the cluster. An incorrect vCenter username or password makes the cluster nodes unschedulable.
====
+
. In the *Datacenter* field, enter the name of the vSphere data center that contains the virtual machines used to host the cluster; for example, `SDDC-Datacenter`.
. In the *Default data store* field, enter the path and name of the vSphere data store that stores the persistent data volumes; for example, `/SDDC-Datacenter/datastore/datastorename`.
+
[WARNING]
====
Updating the vSphere data center or default data store after the configuration has been saved detaches any active vSphere `PersistentVolumes`.
====
+
. In the *Virtual Machine Folder* field, enter the data center folder that contains the virtual machine of the cluster; for example, `/SDDC-Datacenter/vm/ci-ln-hjg4vg2-c61657-t2gzr`. For the {product-title} installation to succeed, all virtual machines comprising the cluster must be located in a single data center folder.
. Click *Save Configuration*. This updates the `cloud-provider-config` ConfigMap resource in the `openshift-config` namespace, and starts the configuration process.
. Reopen the *vSphere connection configuration* wizard and expand the *Monitored operators* panel. Check that the status of the operators is either *Progressing* or *Healthy*.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="configuring-vSphere-monitoring-configuration-completion{context}"]
= Verifying the configuration

The connection configuration process updates operator statuses and control plane nodes. It takes approximately an hour to complete. During the configuration process, the nodes will reboot. Previously bound `PersistentVolumeClaims` objects might become disconnected.

.Prerequisites
* You have saved the configuration settings in the *vSphere connection configuration* wizard.

.Procedure

. Check that the configuration process completed successfully:
+
--
.. In the OpenShift Container Platform Administrator perspective, navigate to *Home -> Overview*.
.. Under *Status* click *Operators*. Wait for all operator statuses to change from  *Progressing* to *All succeeded*.  A *Failed* status indicates that the configuration failed.
.. Under *Status*, click *Control Plane*. Wait for the response rate of all Control Pane components to return to 100%. A *Failed* control plane component indicates that the configuration failed.
--
A failure indicates that at least one of the connection settings is incorrect. Change the settings in the *vSphere connection configuration* wizard and save the configuration again.

. Check that you are able to bind `PersistentVolumeClaims` objects by performing the following steps:

.. Create a `StorageClass` object using the following YAML:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
 name: vsphere-sc
provisioner: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume
parameters:
 datastore: YOURVCENTERDATASTORE
 diskformat: thin
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
----
.. Create a `PersistentVolumeClaims` object using the following YAML:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
 name: test-pvc
 namespace: openshift-config
 annotations:
   volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-provisioner: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume
 finalizers:
   - kubernetes.io/pvc-protection
spec:
 accessModes:
   - ReadWriteOnce
 resources:
   requests:
    storage: 10Gi
 storageClassName: vsphere-sc
 volumeMode: Filesystem
----
+
If you are unable to create a `PersistentVolumeClaims` object, you can troubleshoot by navigating to *Storage* -> *PersistentVolumeClaims* in the *Administrator* perspective of the {product-title} web console.

There are times when you need to make changes to the operating systems running on {product-title} nodes. This can include changing settings for network time service, adding kernel arguments, or configuring journaling in a specific way.

Aside from a few specialized features, most changes to operating systems on {product-title} nodes can be done by creating what are referred to as `MachineConfig` objects that are managed by the Machine Config Operator.

Tasks in this section describe how to use features of the Machine Config Operator to configure operating system features on {product-title} nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
NetworkManager stores new network configurations to `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/` in a key file format.

Previously, NetworkManager stored new network configurations to `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/` in the ifcfg format. Starting with RHEL 9.0, RHEL stores new network configurations at `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/` in a key file format. The connections configurations stored to `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/` in the old format still work uninterrupted. Modifications in existing profiles continue updating the older files.

== Purpose

The Machine Config Operator manages and applies configuration and updates of the base operating system and container runtime, including everything between the kernel and kubelet.

There are four components:

* `machine-config-server`: Provides Ignition configuration to new machines joining the cluster.
* `machine-config-controller`: Coordinates the upgrade of machines to the desired configurations defined by a `MachineConfig` object. Options are provided to control the upgrade for sets of machines individually.
* `machine-config-daemon`: Applies new machine configuration during update. Validates and verifies the state of the machine to the requested machine configuration.
* `machine-config`: Provides a complete source of machine configuration at installation, first start up, and updates for a machine.

:_mod-docs-content-type: SNIPPET

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, there is no supported way to block or restrict the machine config server endpoint. The machine config server must be exposed to the network so that newly-provisioned machines, which have no existing configuration or state, are able to fetch their configuration. In this model, the root of trust is the certificate signing requests (CSR) endpoint, which is where the kubelet sends its certificate signing request for approval to join the cluster. Because of this, machine configs should not be used to distribute sensitive information, such as secrets and certificates.

To ensure that the machine config server endpoints, ports 22623 and 22624, are secured in bare metal scenarios, customers must configure proper network policies.

= Machine config overview

The Machine Config Operator (MCO) manages updates to systemd, CRI-O and Kubelet, the kernel, Network Manager and other system features. It also offers a `MachineConfig` CRD that can write configuration files onto the host (see link:https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator#machine-config-operator[machine-config-operator]). Understanding what MCO does and how it interacts with other components is critical to making advanced, system-level changes to an {product-title} cluster. Here are some things you should know about MCO, machine configs, and how they are used:

* Machine configs are processed alphabetically, in lexicographically increasing order, of their name. The render controller uses the first machine config in the list as the base and appends the rest to the base machine config.

* A machine config can make a specific change to a file or service on the operating system of each system representing a pool of {product-title} nodes.

* MCO applies changes to operating systems in pools of machines. All {product-title} clusters start with worker and control plane node pools. By adding more role labels, you can configure custom pools of nodes. For example, you can set up a custom pool of worker nodes that includes particular hardware features needed by an application. However, examples in this section focus on changes to the default pool types.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
A node can have multiple labels applied that indicate its type, such as `master` or `worker`, however it can be a member of only a *single* machine config pool.
====

* After a machine config change, the MCO updates the affected nodes alphabetically by zone, based on the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` label. If a zone has more than one node, the oldest nodes are updated first. For nodes that do not use zones, such as in bare metal deployments, the nodes are upgraded by age, with the oldest nodes updated first. The MCO updates the number of nodes as specified by the `maxUnavailable` field on the machine configuration pool at a time.

* Some machine configuration must be in place before {product-title} is installed to disk. In most cases, this can be accomplished by creating
a machine config that is injected directly into the {product-title} installer process, instead of running as a postinstallation machine config. In other cases, you might need to do bare metal installation where you pass kernel arguments at {product-title} installer startup, to do such things as setting per-node individual IP addresses or advanced disk partitioning.

* MCO manages items that are set in machine configs. Manual changes you do to your systems will not be overwritten by MCO, unless MCO is explicitly told to manage a conflicting file. In other words, MCO only makes specific updates you request, it does not claim control over the whole node.

* Manual changes to nodes are strongly discouraged. If you need to decommission a node and start a new one, those direct changes would be lost.

* MCO is only supported for writing to files in `/etc` and `/var` directories, although there are symbolic links to some directories that can be writeable by being symbolically linked to one of those areas. The `/opt` and `/usr/local` directories are examples.

* Ignition is the configuration format used in MachineConfigs. See the link:https://coreos.github.io/ignition/configuration-v3_2/[Ignition Configuration Specification v3.2.0] for details.

* Although Ignition config settings can be delivered directly at {product-title} installation time, and are formatted in the same way that MCO delivers Ignition configs, MCO has no way of seeing what those original Ignition configs are. Therefore, you should wrap Ignition config settings into a machine config before deploying them.

* When a file managed by MCO changes outside of MCO, the Machine Config Daemon (MCD) sets the node as `degraded`. It will not overwrite the
offending file, however, and should continue to operate in a `degraded` state.

* A key reason for using a machine config is that it will be applied when you spin up new nodes for a pool in your {product-title} cluster. The `machine-api-operator` provisions a new machine and MCO configures it.

MCO uses link:https://coreos.github.io/ignition/[Ignition] as the configuration format. {product-title} 4.6 moved from Ignition config specification version 2 to version 3.

== What can you change with machine configs?
The kinds of components that MCO can change include:

* **config**: Create Ignition config objects (see the link:https://coreos.github.io/ignition/configuration-v3_2/[Ignition configuration specification]) to do things like modify files, systemd services, and other features on {product-title} machines, including:
- **Configuration files**: Create or overwrite files in the `/var` or `/etc` directory.
- **systemd units**: Create and set the status of a systemd service or add to an existing systemd service by dropping in additional settings.
- **users and groups**: Change SSH keys in the passwd section postinstallation.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
* Changing SSH keys by using a machine config is supported only for the `core` user.
* Adding new users by using a machine config is not supported.
====
* **kernelArguments**: Add arguments to the kernel command line when {product-title} nodes boot.
* **kernelType**: Optionally identify a non-standard kernel to use instead of the standard kernel. Use `realtime` to use the RT kernel (for RAN). This is only supported on select platforms. Use the `64k-pages` parameter to enable the 64k page size kernel. This setting is exclusive to machines with 64-bit ARM architectures.
* **fips**: Enable link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/security_hardening/index#using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies_security-hardening[FIPS] mode. FIPS should be set at installation-time setting and not a postinstallation procedure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a {op-system-base-full} computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on RHEL, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/assembly_installing-the-system-in-fips-mode_security-hardening[Installing the system in FIPS mode]. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
====
* **extensions**: Extend {op-system} features by adding selected pre-packaged software. For this feature, available extensions include link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/security_hardening/index#protecting-systems-against-intrusive-usb-devices_security-hardening[usbguard] and kernel modules.
* **Custom resources (for `ContainerRuntime` and `Kubelet`)**: Outside of machine configs, MCO manages two special custom resources for modifying CRI-O container runtime settings (`ContainerRuntime` CR) and the Kubelet service (`Kubelet` CR).

The MCO is not the only Operator that can change operating system components on {product-title} nodes. Other Operators can modify operating system-level features as well. One example is the Node Tuning Operator, which allows you to do node-level tuning through Tuned daemon profiles.

Tasks for the MCO configuration that can be done postinstallation are included in the following procedures. See descriptions of {op-system} bare metal installation for system configuration tasks that must be done during or before {product-title} installation.

There might be situations where the configuration on a node does not fully match what the currently-applied machine config specifies. This state is called _configuration drift_. The Machine Config Daemon (MCD) regularly checks the nodes for configuration drift. If the MCD detects configuration drift, the MCO marks the node `degraded` until an administrator corrects the node configuration. A degraded node is online and operational, but, it cannot be updated. For more information on configuration drift, see _Understanding configuration drift detection_.

[id="machine-config-drift-detection_{context}"]
= Understanding configuration drift detection

There might be situations when the on-disk state of a node differs from what is configured in the machine config. This is known as _configuration drift_. For example, a cluster admin might manually modify a file, a systemd unit file, or a file permission that was configured through a machine config. This causes configuration drift. Configuration drift can cause problems between nodes in a Machine Config Pool or when the machine configs are updated.

The Machine Config Operator (MCO) uses the Machine Config Daemon (MCD) to check nodes for configuration drift on a regular basis. If detected, the MCO sets the node and the machine config pool (MCP) to `Degraded` and reports the error. A degraded node is online and operational, but, it cannot be updated.

The MCD performs configuration drift detection upon each of the following conditions:

* When a node boots.
* After any of the files (Ignition files and systemd drop-in units) specified in the machine config are modified outside of the machine config.
* Before a new machine config is applied.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you apply a new machine config to the nodes, the MCD temporarily shuts down configuration drift detection. This shutdown is needed because the new machine config necessarily differs from the machine config on the nodes. After the new machine config is applied, the MCD restarts detecting configuration drift using the new machine config.
====

When performing configuration drift detection, the MCD validates that the file contents and permissions fully match what the currently-applied machine config specifies. Typically, the MCD detects configuration drift in less than a second after the detection is triggered.

If the MCD detects configuration drift, the MCD performs the following tasks:

* Emits an error to the console logs
* Emits a Kubernetes event
* Stops further detection on the node
* Sets the node and MCP to `degraded`

You can check if you have a degraded node by listing the MCPs:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mcp worker
----

If you have a degraded MCP, the `DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT` field is non-zero, similar to the following output:

.Example output
[source,terminal]

You can correct configuration drift and return the node to the `Ready` state by performing one of the following remediations:

* Ensure that the contents and file permissions of the files on the node match what is configured in the machine config. You can manually rewrite the file
contents or change the file permissions.
* Generate a link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5414371[force file] on the degraded node. The force file causes the MCD to bypass the usual configuration drift detection and reapplies the current machine config.
+
[NOTE]
====
Generating a force file on a node causes that node to reboot.

where:

UPDATED:: The `True` status indicates that the MCO has applied the current machine config to the nodes in that MCP. The current machine config is specified in the `STATUS` field in the `oc get mcp` output. The `False` status indicates a node in the MCP is updating.
UPDATING:: The `True` status indicates that the MCO is applying the desired machine config, as specified in the `MachineConfigPool` custom resource, to at least one of the nodes in that MCP. The desired machine config is the new, edited machine config. Nodes that are updating might not be available for scheduling. The `False` status indicates that all nodes in the MCP are updated.
DEGRADED:: A `True` status indicates the MCO is blocked from applying the current or desired machine config to at least one of the nodes in that MCP, or the configuration is failing. Nodes that are degraded might not be available for scheduling. A `False` status indicates that all nodes in the MCP are ready.

In the previous output, there are three control plane (master) nodes and three worker nodes. The control plane MCP and the associated nodes are updated to the current machine config. The nodes in the worker MCP are being updated to the desired machine config. Two of the nodes in the worker MCP are updated and one is still updating, as indicated by the `UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT` being `2`. There are no issues, as indicated by the `DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT` being `0` and `DEGRADED` being `False`.

If something goes wrong with a machine config that you apply, you can always back out that change. For example, if you had run `oc create -f ./myconfig.yaml` to apply a machine config, you could remove that machine config by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f ./myconfig.yaml
----

If that was the only problem, the nodes in the affected pool should return to a non-degraded state. This actually causes the rendered configuration to roll back to its previously rendered state.

If you add your own machine configs to your cluster, you can use the commands shown in the previous example to check their status and the related status of the pool to which they are applied.

UPDATED:: The `True` status indicates that the MCO has applied the current machine config to that particular node. The `False` status indicates that the node is currently updating. The `Unknown` status means the operation is processing.
UPDATEPREPARED:: The `False` status indicates that the MCO has not started reconciling the new machine configs to be distributed. The `True` status indicates that the MCO has completed this phase of the update. The `Unknown` status means the operation is processing.
UPDATEEXECUTED:: The `False` status indicates that the MCO has not started cordoning and draining the node. It also indicates that the disk state and operating system have not started updating. The `True` status indicates that the MCO has completed this phase of the update. The `Unknown` status means the operation is processing.
UPDATEPOSTACTIONCOMPLETED:: The `False` status indicates that the MCO has not started rebooting the node or closing the daemon. The `True` status indicates that the MCO has completed reboot and updating the node status. The `Unknown` status indicates either that an error has occurred during the update process at this phase, or that the MCO is currently applying the update.
UPDATECOMPLETED:: The `False` status indicates that the MCO has not started uncordoning the node and updating the node state and metrics. The `True` status indicates that the MCO has finished updating the node state and available metrics.
RESUMED:: The `False` status indicates that the MCO has not started the config drift monitor. The `True` status indicates that the node has resumed operation. The `Unknown` status means the operation is processing.

[NOTE]
====
Within the primary phases previously described, you can have secondary phases which you can use to see the update progression in more detail. You can get more information that includes secondary phases of updates by using the `-o wide` option of the preceding command. This provides the additional `UPDATECOMPATIBLE`, `UPDATEFILESANDOS`, `DRAINEDNODE`, `CORDONEDNODE`, `REBOOTNODE`, `RELOADEDCRIO` and `UNCORDONED` columns. These secondary phases do not always occur and depend on the type of update you want to apply.

The following certificates are handled in the cluster by the Machine Config Controller (MCC) and can be found in the `ControllerConfig` resource:

* `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt`
* `/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/cloud-config/ca-bundle.pem`
* `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/openshift-config-user-ca-bundle.crt`

The MCC also handles the image registry certificates and its associated user bundle certificate.

You can get information about the listed certificates, including the underyling bundle the certificate comes from, and the signing and subject data.

[id="using-machineconfigs-to-change-machines"]
== Using MachineConfig objects to configure nodes

You can use the tasks in this section to create `MachineConfig` objects that modify files, systemd unit files, and other operating system features running on {product-title} nodes. For more ideas on working with machine configs, see content related to link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3868301[updating] SSH authorized keys, link:https://access.redhat.com/verify-images-ocp4[verifying image signatures], link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4727321[enabling SCTP], and link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5170251[configuring iSCSI initiatornames] for {product-title}.

{product-title} supports link:https://coreos.github.io/ignition/configuration-v3_2/[Ignition specification version 3.2]. All new machine configs you create going forward should be based on Ignition specification version 3.2. If you are upgrading your {product-title} cluster, any existing Ignition specification version 2.x machine configs will be translated automatically to specification version 3.2.

There might be situations where the configuration on a node does not fully match what the currently-applied machine config specifies. This state is called _configuration drift_. The Machine Config Daemon (MCD) regularly checks the nodes for configuration drift. If the MCD detects configuration drift, the MCO marks the node `degraded` until an administrator corrects the node configuration. A degraded node is online and operational, but, it cannot be updated. For more information on configuration drift, see xref:machine-config-drift-detection_post-install-machine-configuration-tasks[Understanding configuration drift detection].

[TIP]
====
Use the following "Configuring chrony time service" procedure as a model for how to go about adding other configuration files to {product-title} nodes.

[id="installation-special-config-chrony_{context}"]
= Configuring chrony time service

You
can
set the time server and related settings used by the chrony time service (`chronyd`)
by modifying the contents of the `chrony.conf` file and passing those contents
to your nodes as a machine config.

.Procedure

. Create a Butane config including the contents of the `chrony.conf` file. For example, to configure chrony on worker nodes, create a `99-worker-chrony.bu` file.
+
[NOTE]
====
See "Creating machine configs with Butane" for information about Butane.

<1> On control plane nodes, substitute `master` for `worker` in both of these locations.
<2> Specify an octal value mode for the `mode` field in the machine config file. After creating the file and applying the changes, the `mode` is converted to a decimal value. You can check the YAML file with the command `oc get mc <mc-name> -o yaml`.
<3> Specify any valid, reachable time source, such as the one provided by your DHCP server.
Alternately, you can specify any of the following NTP servers: `1.rhel.pool.ntp.org`, `2.rhel.pool.ntp.org`, or `3.rhel.pool.ntp.org`.

. Use Butane to generate a `MachineConfig` object file, `99-worker-chrony.yaml`, containing the configuration to be delivered to the nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ butane 99-worker-chrony.bu -o 99-worker-chrony.yaml
----

. Apply the configurations in one of two ways:
+
* If the cluster is not running yet, after you generate manifest files, add the `MachineConfig` object file to the `<installation_directory>/openshift` directory, and then continue to create the cluster.
+
* If the cluster is already running, apply the file:
+
[source,terminal]

[id="nodes-nodes-kernel-arguments_{context}"]
= Adding kernel arguments to nodes

In some special cases, you might want to add kernel arguments to a set of nodes in your cluster. This should only be done with caution and clear understanding of the implications of the arguments you set.

[WARNING]
====
Improper use of kernel arguments can result in your systems becoming unbootable.
====

Examples of kernel arguments you could set include:

* **nosmt**: Disables symmetric multithreading (SMT) in the kernel. Multithreading allows multiple logical threads for each CPU. You could consider `nosmt` in multi-tenant environments to reduce risks from potential cross-thread attacks. By disabling SMT, you essentially choose security over performance.

* **systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy**: Enables link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html[Linux control group version 2] (cgroup v2). cgroup v2 is the next version of the kernel link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/resource_management_guide/ch01[control group] and offers multiple improvements.


* **enforcing=0**: Configures Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) to run in permissive mode. In permissive mode, the system acts as if SELinux is enforcing the loaded security policy, including labeling objects and emitting access denial entries in the logs, but it does not actually deny any operations. While not supported for production systems, permissive mode can be helpful for debugging.
+
[WARNING]
====
Disabling SELinux on {op-system} in production is not supported.
Once SELinux has been disabled on a node, it must be re-provisioned before re-inclusion in a production cluster.
====

See link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt[Kernel.org kernel parameters] for a list and descriptions of kernel arguments.

In the following procedure, you create a `MachineConfig` object that identifies:

* A set of machines to which you want to add the kernel argument. In this case, machines with a worker role.
* Kernel arguments that are appended to the end of the existing kernel arguments.
* A label that indicates where in the list of machine configs the change is applied.

.Prerequisites
* Have administrative privilege to a working {product-title} cluster.

.Procedure

. List existing `MachineConfig` objects for your {product-title} cluster to determine how to
label your machine config:

[id="rhcos-enabling-multipath-day-2_{context}"]
= Enabling multipathing with kernel arguments on {op-system}

{op-system-first} supports multipathing on the primary disk, allowing stronger resilience to hardware failure to achieve higher host availability. Postinstallation support is available by activating multipathing via the machine config.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Enabling multipathing during installation is supported and recommended for nodes provisioned in {product-title} 4.8 or higher. In setups where any I/O to non-optimized paths results in I/O system errors, you must enable multipathing at installation time. For more information about enabling multipathing during installation time, see "Enabling multipathing with kernel arguments on RHCOS" in the _Installing on bare metal_ documentation.
====
[IMPORTANT]
====
On {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}, you can enable multipathing only if you configured your cluster for it during installation. For more information, see "Installing {op-system} and starting the {product-title} bootstrap process" in _Installing a cluster with z/VM on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}_.
====
// Add xref once it's allowed.

.Prerequisites
* You have a running {product-title} cluster that uses version 4.7 or later.
* You are logged in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.
* You have confirmed that the disk is enabled for multipathing. Multipathing is only supported on hosts that are connected to a SAN via an HBA adapter.

.Procedure

. To enable multipathing postinstallation on control plane nodes:

* Create a machine config file, such as `99-master-kargs-mpath.yaml`, that instructs the cluster to add the `master` label and that identifies the multipath kernel argument, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: "master"
  name: 99-master-kargs-mpath
spec:
  kernelArguments:
    - 'rd.multipath=default'
    - 'root=/dev/disk/by-label/dm-mpath-root'
----

. To enable multipathing postinstallation on worker nodes:

* Create a machine config file, such as `99-worker-kargs-mpath.yaml`, that instructs the cluster to add the `worker` label and that identifies the multipath kernel argument, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1

spec:
  kernelArguments:
    - 'rd.multipath=default'
    - 'root=/dev/disk/by-label/dm-mpath-root'
----

. Create the new machine config by using either the master or worker YAML file you previously created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f ./99-worker-kargs-mpath.yaml

= Adding a real-time kernel to nodes

Some {product-title} workloads require a high degree of determinism.While Linux is not a real-time operating system, the Linux real-time
kernel includes a preemptive scheduler that provides the operating system with real-time characteristics.

If your {product-title} workloads require these real-time characteristics, you can switch your machines to the Linux real-time kernel. For {product-title}, {product-version} you can make this switch using a `MachineConfig` object. Although making the change is as simple as changing a machine config `kernelType` setting to `realtime`, there are a few other considerations before making the change:

* Currently, real-time kernel is supported only on worker nodes, and only for radio access network (RAN) use.
* The following procedure is fully supported with bare metal installations that use systems that are certified for Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Real Time 8.
* Real-time support in {product-title} is limited to specific subscriptions.
* The following procedure is also supported for use with Google Cloud Platform.

.Prerequisites
* Have a running {product-title} cluster (version 4.4 or later).
* Log in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a machine config for the real-time kernel: Create a YAML file (for example, `99-worker-realtime.yaml`) that contains a `MachineConfig`
object for the `realtime` kernel type. This example tells the cluster to use a real-time kernel for all worker nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF > 99-worker-realtime.yaml

metadata:
  labels:

  name: 99-worker-realtime
spec:
  kernelType: realtime
EOF
----

. Add the machine config to the cluster. Type the following to add the machine config to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f 99-worker-realtime.yaml
----

. Check the real-time kernel: Once each impacted node reboots, log in to the cluster and run the following commands to make sure that the real-time kernel has replaced the regular kernel for the set of nodes you configured:

= Configuring journald settings

If you need to configure settings for the `journald` service on {product-title} nodes, you can do that by modifying the appropriate configuration file and passing the file to the appropriate pool of nodes as a machine config.

This procedure describes how to modify `journald` rate limiting settings in the `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` file and apply them to worker nodes. See the `journald.conf` man page for information on how to use that file.

.Prerequisites
* Have a running {product-title} cluster.
* Log in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a Butane config file, `40-worker-custom-journald.bu`, that includes an `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` file with the required settings.

= Adding extensions to {op-system}
{op-system} is a minimal container-oriented RHEL operating system, designed to provide a common set of capabilities to {product-title} clusters across all platforms. While adding software packages to {op-system} systems is generally discouraged, the MCO provides an `extensions` feature you can use to add a minimal set of features to {op-system} nodes.

Currently, the following extensions are available:

* **kerberos**: Adding the `kerberos` extension provides a mechanism that allows both users and machines to identify themselves to the network to receive defined, limited access to the areas and services that an administrator has configured. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system-level_authentication_guide/using_kerberos[Using Kerberos] for details, including how to set up a Kerberos client and mount a Kerberized NFS share.

The following procedure describes how to use a machine config to add one or more extensions to your {op-system} nodes.

.Prerequisites
* Have a running {product-title} cluster (version 4.6 or later).
* Log in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a machine config for extensions: Create a YAML file (for example, `80-extensions.yaml`) that contains a `MachineConfig` `extensions` object. This example tells the cluster to add the `usbguard` extension.

[id="rhcos-load-firmware-blobs_{context}"]
= Loading custom firmware blobs in the machine config manifest

Because the default location for firmware blobs in `/usr/lib` is read-only, you can locate a custom firmware blob by updating the search path. This enables you to load local firmware blobs in the machine config manifest when the blobs are not managed by {op-system}.

.Procedure

. Create a Butane config file, `98-worker-firmware-blob.bu`, that updates the search path so that it is root-owned and writable to local storage. The following example places the custom blob file from your local workstation onto nodes under `/var/lib/firmware`.

<3> Sets the permissions for the file on the {op-system} node. It is recommended to set `0644` permissions.
<4> The `firmware_class.path` parameter customizes the kernel search path of where to look for the custom firmware blob that was copied from your local workstation onto the root file system of the node. This example uses `/var/lib/firmware` as the customized path.

. Run Butane to generate a `MachineConfig` object file that uses a copy of the firmware blob on your local workstation named `98-worker-firmware-blob.yaml`. The firmware blob contains the configuration to be delivered to the nodes. The following example uses the `--files-dir` option to specify the directory on your workstation where the local file or files are located:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ butane 98-worker-firmware-blob.bu -o 98-worker-firmware-blob.yaml --files-dir <directory_including_package_name>
----
. Apply the configurations to the nodes in one of two ways:
+
* If the cluster is not running yet, after you generate manifest files, add the `MachineConfig` object file to the `<installation_directory>/openshift` directory, and then continue to create the cluster.
+
* If the cluster is already running, apply the file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f 98-worker-firmware-blob.yaml
----
+
A `MachineConfig` object YAML file is created for you to finish configuring your machines.
+
. Save the Butane config in case you need to update the `MachineConfig` object in the future.

[id="core-user-password_{context}"]
= Changing the core user password for node access

By default, {op-system-first} creates a user named `core` on the nodes in your cluster. You can use the `core` user to access the node through a cloud provider serial console or a bare metal baseboard controller manager (BMC). This can be helpful, for example, if a node is down and you cannot access that node by using SSH or the `oc debug node` command. However, by default, there is no password for this user, so you cannot log in without creating one.

You can create a password for the `core` user by using a machine config. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) assigns the password and injects the password into the `/etc/shadow` file, allowing you to log in with the `core` user. The MCO does not examine the password hash. As such, the MCO cannot report if there is a problem with the password.

[NOTE]
====
* The password works only through a cloud provider serial console or a BMC. It does not work with SSH.

* If you have a machine config that includes an `/etc/shadow` file or a systemd unit that sets a password, it takes precedence over the password hash.
====

You can change the password, if needed, by editing the machine config you used to create the password. Also, you can remove the password by deleting the machine config. Deleting the machine config does not remove the user account.

.Prerequisites

* Create a hashed password by using a tool that is supported by your operating system.

.Procedure

. Create a machine config file that contains the `core` username and the hashed password:

== Configuring MCO-related custom resources

Besides managing `MachineConfig` objects, the MCO manages two custom resources (CRs): `KubeletConfig` and `ContainerRuntimeConfig`. Those CRs let you change node-level settings impacting how the Kubelet and CRI-O container runtime services behave.

[id="create-a-kubeletconfig-crd-to-edit-kubelet-parameters_{context}"]
= Creating a KubeletConfig CRD to edit kubelet parameters

The kubelet configuration is currently serialized as an Ignition configuration, so it can be directly edited. However, there is also a new `kubelet-config-controller` added to the Machine Config Controller (MCC). This lets you use a `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) to edit the kubelet parameters.

[NOTE]
====
As the fields in the `kubeletConfig` object are passed directly to the kubelet from upstream Kubernetes, the kubelet validates those values directly. Invalid values in the `kubeletConfig` object might cause cluster nodes to become unavailable. For valid values, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1/[Kubernetes documentation].
====

Consider the following guidance:

* Create one `KubeletConfig` CR for each machine config pool with all the config changes you want for that pool. If you are applying the same content to all of the pools, you need only one `KubeletConfig` CR for all of the pools.

* Edit an existing `KubeletConfig` CR to modify existing settings or add new settings, instead of creating a CR for each change. It is recommended that you create a CR only to modify a different machine config pool, or for changes that are intended to be temporary, so that you can revert the changes.

* As needed, create multiple `KubeletConfig` CRs with a limit of 10 per cluster. For the first `KubeletConfig` CR, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) creates a machine config appended with `kubelet`. With each subsequent CR, the controller creates another `kubelet` machine config with a numeric suffix. For example, if you have a `kubelet` machine config with a `-2` suffix, the next `kubelet` machine config is appended with `-3`.

If you want to delete the machine configs, delete them in reverse order to avoid exceeding the limit. For example, you delete the `kubelet-3` machine config before deleting the `kubelet-2` machine config.

[NOTE]
====
If you have a machine config with a `kubelet-9` suffix, and you create another `KubeletConfig` CR, a new machine config is not created, even if there are fewer than 10 `kubelet` machine configs.

The following procedure is an example to show how to configure the maximum number of pods per node on the worker nodes.

Perform one of the following steps:

.. View the machine config pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe machineconfigpool <name>
----

For example:
+
[source,terminal]

<1> If a label has been added it appears under `labels`.

.. If the label is not present, add a key/value pair:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label machineconfigpool worker custom-kubelet=set-max-pods
----

.Procedure

. View the available machine configuration objects that you can select:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfig
----
+
By default, the two kubelet-related configs are `01-master-kubelet` and `01-worker-kubelet`.

. Check the current value for the maximum pods per node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node <node_name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node ci-ln-5grqprb-f76d1-ncnqq-worker-a-mdv94
----
+
Look for `value: pods: <value>` in the `Allocatable` stanza:

----

. Set the maximum pods per node on the worker nodes by creating a custom resource file that contains the kubelet configuration:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Kubelet configurations that target a specific machine config pool also affect any dependent pools. For example, creating a kubelet configuration for the pool containing worker nodes will also apply to any subset pools, including the pool containing infrastructure nodes. To avoid this, you must create a new machine config pool with a selection expression that only includes worker nodes, and have your kubelet configuration target this new pool.

====
The rate at which the kubelet talks to the API server depends on queries per second (QPS) and burst values. The default values, `50` for `kubeAPIQPS` and `100` for `kubeAPIBurst`, are sufficient if there are limited pods running on each node. It is recommended to update the kubelet QPS and burst rates if there are enough CPU and memory resources on the node.

[id="create-a-containerruntimeconfig_{context}"]
= Creating a ContainerRuntimeConfig CR to edit CRI-O parameters

You can change some of the settings associated with the {product-title} CRI-O runtime for the nodes associated with a specific machine config pool (MCP). Using a `ContainerRuntimeConfig` custom resource (CR), you set the configuration values and add a label to match the MCP. The MCO then rebuilds the `crio.conf` and `storage.conf` configuration files on the associated nodes with the updated values.

[NOTE]
====
To revert the changes implemented by using a `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR, you must delete the CR. Removing the label from the machine config pool does not revert the changes.
====

You can modify the following settings by using a `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR:

* **PIDs limit**: Setting the PIDs limit in the `ContainerRuntimeConfig` is expected to be deprecated. If PIDs limits are required, it is recommended to use the `podPidsLimit` field in the `KubeletConfig` CR instead. The default value of the `podPidsLimit` field is `4096`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The CRI-O flag is applied on the cgroup of the container, while the Kubelet flag is set on the cgroup of the pod. Please adjust the PIDs limit accordingly.
====

* **Log level**: The `logLevel` parameter sets the CRI-O `log_level` parameter, which is the level of verbosity for log messages. The default is `info` (`log_level = info`). Other options include `fatal`, `panic`, `error`, `warn`, `debug`, and `trace`.
* **Overlay size**: The `overlaySize` parameter sets the CRI-O Overlay storage driver `size` parameter, which is the maximum size of a container image.
* **Maximum log size**: Setting the maximum log size in the `ContainerRuntimeConfig` is expected to be deprecated. If a maximum log size is required, it is recommended to use the `containerLogMaxSize` field in the `KubeletConfig` CR instead.
* **Container runtime**: The `defaultRuntime` parameter sets the container runtime to either `runc` or `crun`. The default is `runc`.

You should have one `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR for each machine config pool with all the config changes you want for that pool. If you are applying the same content to all the pools, you only need one `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR for all the pools.

You should edit an existing `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR to modify existing settings or add new settings instead of creating a new CR for each change. It is recommended to create a new `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR only to modify a different machine config pool, or for changes that are intended to be temporary so that you can revert the changes.

You can create multiple `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CRs, as needed, with a limit of 10 per cluster. For the first `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR, the MCO creates a machine config appended with `containerruntime`. With each subsequent CR, the controller creates a new `containerruntime` machine config with a numeric suffix. For example, if you have a `containerruntime` machine config with a `-2` suffix, the next `containerruntime` machine config is appended with `-3`.

If you want to delete the machine configs, you should delete them in reverse order to avoid exceeding the limit. For example, you should delete the `containerruntime-3` machine config before deleting the `containerruntime-2` machine config.

[NOTE]
====
If you have a machine config with a `containerruntime-9` suffix, and you create another `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR, a new machine config is not created, even if there are fewer than 10 `containerruntime` machine configs.

.Procedure

To change CRI-O settings using the `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR:

. Create a YAML file for the `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: ContainerRuntimeConfig
metadata:
 name: overlay-size
spec:
 machineConfigPoolSelector:
   matchLabels:
     pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: '' <1>
 containerRuntimeConfig: <2>
   logLevel: debug
   overlaySize: 8G
----
<1> Specify a label for the machine config pool that you want you want to modify.
<2> Set the parameters as needed.

. Create the `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
----

. Verify that the CR is created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ContainerRuntimeConfig
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME           AGE
overlay-size   3m19s
----

. Check that a new `containerruntime` machine config is created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfigs | grep containerrun
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
99-worker-generated-containerruntime   2c9371fbb673b97a6fe8b1c52691999ed3a1bfc2  3.2.0  31s
----

. Monitor the machine config pool until all are shown as ready:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mcp worker
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME    CONFIG               UPDATED  UPDATING  DEGRADED  MACHINECOUNT  READYMACHINECOUNT  UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT  DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT  AGE

----

. Verify that the settings were applied in CRI-O:

.. Open an `oc debug` session to a node in the machine config pool and run `chroot /host`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# chroot /host
----

.. Verify the changes in the `crio.conf` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# crio config | grep 'log_level'
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
log_level = "debug"
----

.. Verify the changes in the `storage.conf`file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# head -n 7 /etc/containers/storage.conf
----
+
.Example output
+
----
[storage]
  driver = "overlay"
  runroot = "/var/run/containers/storage"

[id="set-the-default-max-container-root-partition-size-for-overlay-with-crio_{context}"]
= Setting the default maximum container root partition size for Overlay with CRI-O

The root partition of each container shows all of the available disk space of the underlying host. Follow this guidance to set a maximum partition size for the root disk of all containers.

To configure the maximum Overlay size, as well as other CRI-O options like the log level, you can create the following `ContainerRuntimeConfig` custom resource definition (CRD):

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: ContainerRuntimeConfig
metadata:
 name: overlay-size
spec:
 machineConfigPoolSelector:
   matchLabels:
     custom-crio: overlay-size
 containerRuntimeConfig:
   logLevel: debug
   overlaySize: 8G
----

.Procedure

. Create the configuration object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f overlaysize.yml
----

. To apply the new CRI-O configuration to your worker nodes, edit the worker machine config pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineconfigpool worker
----

. Add the `custom-crio` label based on the `matchLabels` name you set in the `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CRD:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2020-07-09T15:46:34Z"
  generation: 3
  labels:
    custom-crio: overlay-size
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/mco-built-in: ""
----

. Save the changes, then view the machine configs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfigs
----
+
New `99-worker-generated-containerruntime` and `rendered-worker-xyz` objects are created:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
99-worker-generated-containerruntime  4173030d89fbf4a7a0976d1665491a4d9a6e54f1   3.2.0             7m42s
rendered-worker-xyz                   4173030d89fbf4a7a0976d1665491a4d9a6e54f1   3.2.0             7m36s
----

. After those objects are created, monitor the machine config pool for the changes to be applied:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mcp worker
----
+
The worker nodes show `UPDATING` as `True`, as well as the number of machines, the number updated, and other details:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME   CONFIG              UPDATED   UPDATING   DEGRADED  MACHINECOUNT  READYMACHINECOUNT  UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT   DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT   AGE
worker rendered-worker-xyz False True False     3             2                   2                    0                      20h
----
+
When complete, the worker nodes transition back to `UPDATING` as `False`, and the `UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT` number matches the `MACHINECOUNT`:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME   CONFIG              UPDATED   UPDATING   DEGRADED  MACHINECOUNT  READYMACHINECOUNT  UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT   DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT   AGE

----
+
Looking at a worker machine, you see that the new 8 GB max size configuration is applied to all of the workers:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
head -n 7 /etc/containers/storage.conf
[storage]

----
+
Looking inside a container, you see that the root partition is now 8 GB:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

toc::[]

After installing {product-title}, you can further expand and customize your cluster to your requirements.

[id="available_cluster_customizations"]
== Available cluster customizations

You complete most of the cluster configuration and customization after you deploy your {product-title} cluster. A number of _configuration resources_ are available.

[NOTE]
====
If you install your cluster on {ibm-z-name}, not all features and functions are available.
====

You modify the configuration resources to configure the major features of the
cluster, such as the image registry, networking configuration, image build
behavior, and the identity provider.

For current documentation of the settings that you control by using these resources, use
the `oc explain` command, for example `oc explain builds --api-version=config.openshift.io/v1`

[id="configuration-resources_{context}"]
=== Cluster configuration resources

All cluster configuration resources are globally scoped (not namespaced) and named `cluster`.
////
Config changes should not require coordinated changes between config resources, if you find
yourself struggling to update these docs to explain coordinated changes, please reach out
to @api-approvers (github) or #forum-api-review (slack).

[id="images-update-global-pull-secret_{context}"]
= Updating the global cluster pull secret

You can update the global pull secret for your cluster by either replacing the current pull secret or appending a new pull secret.

The procedure is required when users use a separate registry to store images than the registry used during installation.


.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure
. Optional: To append a new pull secret to the existing pull secret, complete the following steps:

.. Enter the following command to download the pull secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --template='{{index .data ".dockerconfigjson" | base64decode}}' ><pull_secret_location> <1>
----
<1> Provide the path to the pull secret file.

.. Enter the following command to add the new pull secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc registry login --registry="<registry>" \ <1>

== Adding worker nodes

After you deploy your {product-title} cluster, you can add worker nodes to scale cluster resources. There are different ways you can add worker nodes depending on the installation method and the environment of your cluster.

=== Adding worker nodes to installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters

For installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, you can manually or automatically scale the `MachineSet` object to match the number of available bare-metal hosts.

To add a bare-metal host, you must configure all network prerequisites, configure an associated `baremetalhost` object, then provision the worker node to the cluster. You can add a bare-metal host manually or by using the web console.

=== Adding worker nodes to user-provisioned infrastructure clusters

For user-provisioned infrastructure clusters, you can add worker nodes by using a {op-system-base} or {op-system} ISO image and connecting it to your cluster using cluster Ignition config files. For RHEL worker nodes, the following example uses Ansible playbooks to add worker nodes to the cluster. For RHCOS worker nodes, the following example uses an ISO image and network booting to add worker nodes to the cluster.

* xref:post-install-config-adding-rhel-compute[Adding RHEL worker nodes to a user-provisioned infrastructure cluster]

=== Adding worker nodes to clusters managed by the Assisted Installer

For clusters managed by the Assisted Installer, you can add worker nodes by using the {cluster-manager-first} console, the Assisted Installer REST API or you can manually add worker nodes using an ISO image and cluster Ignition config files.

= Understanding the difference between compute machine sets and the machine config pool

`MachineSet` objects describe {product-title} nodes with respect to the cloud or machine provider.

The `MachineConfigPool` object allows `MachineConfigController` components to define and provide the status of machines in the context of upgrades.

The `MachineConfigPool` object allows users to configure how upgrades are rolled out to the {product-title} nodes in the machine config pool.

The `NodeSelector` object can be replaced with a reference to the `MachineSet` object.

[id="machineset-manually-scaling_{context}"]
= Scaling a compute machine set manually

To add or remove an instance of a machine in a compute machine set, you can manually scale the compute machine set.

This guidance is relevant to fully automated, installer-provisioned infrastructure installations. Customized, user-provisioned infrastructure installations do not have compute machine sets.

.Prerequisites

* Install an {product-title} cluster and the `oc` command line.
* Log in to  `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. View the compute machine sets that are in the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
The compute machine sets are listed in the form of `<clusterid>-worker-<aws-region-az>`.

. View the compute machines that are in the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machine -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Set the annotation on the compute machine that you want to delete by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate machine/<machine_name> -n openshift-machine-api machine.openshift.io/delete-machine="true"
----

. Scale the compute machine set by running one of the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to scale the compute machine set:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata:
  name: <machineset>
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
  replicas: 2
----
====
+
You can scale the compute machine set up or down. It takes several minutes for the new machines to be available.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, the machine controller tries to drain the node that is backed by the machine until it succeeds. In some situations, such as with a misconfigured pod disruption budget, the drain operation might not be able to succeed. If the drain operation fails, the machine controller cannot proceed removing the machine.

You can skip draining the node by annotating `machine.openshift.io/exclude-node-draining` in a specific machine.
====

.Verification

* Verify the deletion of the intended machine by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machines
----

:leveloffset: 1

:leveloffset: +2

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//

// * post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc

[id="machineset-delete-policy_{context}"]
= The compute machine set deletion policy

`Random`, `Newest`, and `Oldest` are the three supported deletion options. The default is `Random`, meaning that random machines are chosen and deleted when scaling compute machine sets down. The deletion policy can be set according to the use case by modifying the particular compute machine set:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  deletePolicy: <delete_policy>
  replicas: <desired_replica_count>
----

Specific machines can also be prioritized for deletion by adding the annotation `machine.openshift.io/delete-machine=true` to the machine of interest, regardless of the deletion policy.

[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, the {product-title} router pods are deployed on workers. Because the router is required to access some cluster resources, including the web console, do not scale the worker compute machine set to `0` unless you first relocate the router pods.
====

[NOTE]
====
Custom compute machine sets can be used for use cases requiring that services run on specific nodes and that those services are ignored by the controller when the worker compute machine sets are scaling down. This prevents service disruption.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="nodes-scheduler-node-selectors-cluster_{context}"]
= Creating default cluster-wide node selectors

You can use default cluster-wide node selectors on pods together with labels on nodes to constrain all pods created in a cluster to specific nodes.

With cluster-wide node selectors, when you create a pod in that cluster, {product-title} adds the default node selectors to the pod and schedules
the pod on nodes with matching labels.

You configure cluster-wide node selectors by editing the Scheduler Operator custom resource (CR). You add labels to a node, a compute machine set, or a machine config. Adding the label to the compute machine set ensures that if the node or machine goes down, new nodes have the label. Labels added to a node or machine config do not persist if the node or machine goes down.

[NOTE]
====
You can add additional key/value pairs to a pod. But you cannot add a different value for a default key.
====

.Procedure

To add a default cluster-wide node selector:

. Edit the Scheduler Operator CR to add the default cluster-wide node selectors:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit scheduler cluster
----
+
.Example Scheduler Operator CR with a node selector
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Scheduler
metadata:
  name: cluster
...
spec:
  defaultNodeSelector: type=user-node,region=east <1>
  mastersSchedulable: false
----
<1> Add a node selector with the appropriate `<key>:<value>` pairs.
+
After making this change, wait for the pods in the `openshift-kube-apiserver` project to redeploy. This can take several minutes. The default cluster-wide node selector does not take effect until the pods redeploy.

. Add labels to a node by using a compute machine set or editing the node directly:

* Use a compute machine set to add labels to nodes managed by the compute machine set when a node is created:

.. Run the following command to add labels to a `MachineSet` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch MachineSet <name> --type='json' -p='[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/metadata/labels", "value":{"<key>"="<value>","<key>"="<value>"}}]'  -n openshift-machine-api <1>
----
<1> Add a `<key>/<value>` pair for each label.
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch MachineSet ci-ln-l8nry52-f76d1-hl7m7-worker-c --type='json' -p='[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/metadata/labels", "value":{"type":"user-node","region":"east"}}]'  -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add labels to a compute machine set:

      metadata:
        labels:
          region: "east"
          type: "user-node"
----
====

.. Verify that the labels are added to the `MachineSet` object by using the `oc edit` command:
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit MachineSet abc612-msrtw-worker-us-east-1c -n openshift-machine-api

      metadata:
        labels:
          region: east
          type: user-node
  ...
----

.. Redeploy the nodes associated with that compute machine set by scaling down to `0` and scaling up the nodes:
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=0 MachineSet ci-ln-l8nry52-f76d1-hl7m7-worker-c -n openshift-machine-api

.. When the nodes are ready and available, verify that the label is added to the nodes by using the `oc get` command:
+
[source,terminal]

If the cluster administrator has performed latency tests for platform verification, they can discover the need to adjust the operation of the cluster to ensure stability in cases of high latency. The cluster administrator need change only one parameter, recorded in a file, which controls four parameters affecting how supervisory processes read status and interpret the health of the cluster. Changing only the one parameter provides cluster tuning in an easy, supportable manner.

The `Kubelet` process provides the starting point for monitoring cluster health. The `Kubelet` sets status values for all nodes in the {product-title} cluster. The Kubernetes Controller Manager (`kube controller`) reads the status values every 10 seconds, by default.
If the `kube controller` cannot read a node status value, it loses contact with that node after a configured period. The default behavior is:

. The node controller on the control plane updates the node health to `Unhealthy` and marks the node `Ready` condition`Unknown`.

. In response, the scheduler stops scheduling pods to that node.

. The Node Lifecycle Controller adds a `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` taint with a `NoExecute` effect to the node and schedules any pods on the node for eviction after five minutes, by default.

This behavior can cause problems if your network is prone to latency issues, especially if you have nodes at the network edge. In some cases, the Kubernetes Controller Manager might not receive an update from a healthy node due to network latency. The `Kubelet` evicts pods from the node even though the node is healthy.

To avoid this problem, you can use _worker latency profiles_ to adjust the frequency that the `Kubelet` and the Kubernetes Controller Manager wait for status updates before taking action. These adjustments help to ensure that your cluster runs properly if network latency between the control plane and the worker nodes is not optimal.

These worker latency profiles contain three sets of parameters that are pre-defined with carefully tuned values to control the reaction of the cluster to increased latency. No need to experimentally find the best values manually.

You can configure worker latency profiles when installing a cluster or at any time you notice increased latency in your cluster network.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="nodes-cluster-worker-latency-profiles-about_{context}"]
= Understanding worker latency profiles

Worker latency profiles are four different categories of carefully-tuned parameters. The four parameters which implement these values are `node-status-update-frequency`, `node-monitor-grace-period`, `default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds`. These parameters can use values which allow you control the reaction of the cluster to latency issues without needing to determine the best values using manual methods.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Setting these parameters manually is not supported. Incorrect parameter settings adversely affect cluster stability.
====

All worker latency profiles configure the following parameters:

--
node-status-update-frequency:: Specifies how often the kubelet posts node status to the API server.
node-monitor-grace-period::  Specifies the amount of time in seconds that the Kubernetes Controller Manager waits for an update from a kubelet before marking the node unhealthy and adding the `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` or `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` taint to the node.
default-not-ready-toleration-seconds:: Specifies the amount of time in seconds after marking a node unhealthy that the Kube API Server Operator waits before evicting pods from that node.
default-unreachable-toleration-seconds:: Specifies the amount of time in seconds after marking a node unreachable that the Kube API Server Operator waits before evicting pods from that node.
--

The following Operators monitor the changes to the worker latency profiles and respond accordingly:

* The Machine Config Operator (MCO) updates the `node-status-update-frequency` parameter on the worker nodes.
* The Kubernetes Controller Manager updates the `node-monitor-grace-period` parameter on the control plane nodes.
* The Kubernetes API Server Operator updates the `default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds` parameters on the control plane nodes.

Although the default configuration works in most cases, {product-title} offers two other worker latency profiles for situations where the network is experiencing higher latency than usual. The three worker latency profiles are described in the following sections:

Default worker latency profile:: With the `Default` profile, each `Kubelet` updates it's status every 10 seconds (`node-status-update-frequency`). The `Kube Controller Manager` checks the statuses of `Kubelet` every 5 seconds (`node-monitor-grace-period`).
+
The Kubernetes Controller Manager waits 40 seconds for a status update from `Kubelet` before considering the `Kubelet` unhealthy. If no status is made available to the Kubernetes Controller Manager, it then marks the node with the `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` or `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` taint and evicts the pods on that node.
+
If a pod on that node has the `NoExecute` taint, the pod is run according to `tolerationSeconds`. If the pod has no taint, it will be evicted in 300 seconds (`default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds` settings of the `Kube API Server`).

Medium worker latency profile:: Use the `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` profile if the network latency is slightly higher than usual.
+
The `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` profile reduces the frequency of kubelet updates to 20 seconds and changes the period that the Kubernetes Controller Manager waits for those updates to 2 minutes. The pod eviction period for a pod on that node is reduced to 60 seconds. If the pod has the `tolerationSeconds` parameter, the eviction waits for the period specified by that parameter.
+
The Kubernetes Controller Manager waits for 2 minutes to consider a node unhealthy. In another minute, the eviction process starts.

= Using and changing worker latency profiles

To change a worker latency profile to deal with network latency, edit the `node.config` object to add the name of the profile. You can change the profile at any time as latency increases or decreases.

You must move one worker latency profile at a time. For example, you cannot move directly from the `Default` profile to the `LowUpdateSlowReaction` worker latency profile. You must move from the `Default` worker latency profile to the `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` profile first, then to `LowUpdateSlowReaction`. Similarly, when returning to the `Default` profile, you must move from the low profile to the medium profile first, then to `Default`.

[NOTE]
====
You can also configure worker latency profiles upon installing an {product-title} cluster.
====

.Procedure

To move from the default worker latency profile:

. Move to the medium worker latency profile:

.. Edit the `node.config` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit nodes.config/cluster
----

.. Add `spec.workerLatencyProfile: MediumUpdateAverageReaction`:

== Managing control plane machines

link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/machine_management/#cpmso-about[Control plane machine sets] provide management capabilities for control plane machines that are similar to what compute machine sets provide for compute machines. The availability and initial status of control plane machine sets on your cluster depend on your cloud provider and the version of {product-title} that you installed. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/machine_management/#cpmso-getting-started[Getting started with control plane machine sets].

[id="post-install-creating-infrastructure-machinesets-production"]
== Creating infrastructure machine sets for production environments

You can create a compute machine set to create machines that host only infrastructure components, such as the default router, the integrated container image registry, and components for cluster metrics and monitoring. These infrastructure machines are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment.

In a production deployment, it is recommended that you deploy at least three compute machine sets to hold infrastructure components. Both OpenShift Logging and {SMProductName} deploy Elasticsearch, which requires three instances to be installed on different nodes. Each of these nodes can be deployed to different availability zones for high availability. A configuration like this requires three different compute machine sets, one for each availability zone. In global Azure regions that do not have multiple availability zones, you can use availability sets to ensure high availability.

For information on infrastructure nodes and which components can run on infrastructure nodes, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/machine_management/#creating-infrastructure-machinesets[Creating infrastructure machine sets].

To create an infrastructure node, you can xref:machineset-creating_post-install-cluster-tasks[use a machine set], xref:creating-an-infra-node_post-install-cluster-tasks[assign a label to the nodes], or xref:creating-infra-machines_post-install-cluster-tasks[use a machine config pool].

For sample machine sets that you can use with these procedures, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/machine_management/#creating-infrastructure-machinesets-clouds[Creating machine sets for different clouds].

Applying a specific node selector to all infrastructure components causes {product-title} to xref:moving-resources-to-infrastructure-machinesets[schedule those workloads on nodes with that label].

= Creating a compute machine set

In addition to the compute machine sets created by the installation program, you can create your own to dynamically manage the machine compute resources for specific workloads of your choice.


.Prerequisites

* Deploy an {product-title} cluster.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in to `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. Create a new YAML file that contains the compute machine set custom resource (CR) sample and is named `<file_name>.yaml`.
+
Ensure that you set the `<clusterID>` and `<role>` parameter values.

. Optional: If you are not sure which value to set for a specific field, you can check an existing compute machine set from your cluster.

[id="creating-an-infra-node_{context}"]
= Creating an infrastructure node

[IMPORTANT]
====
See Creating infrastructure machine sets for installer-provisioned infrastructure environments or for any cluster where the control plane nodes are managed by the machine API.
====

Requirements of the cluster dictate that infrastructure, also called `infra` nodes, be provisioned. The installer only provides provisions for control plane and worker nodes. Worker nodes can be designated as infrastructure nodes or application, also called `app`, nodes through labeling.

.Procedure

. Add a label to the worker node that you want to act as application node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/app=""
----

. Add a label to the worker nodes that you want to act as infrastructure nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=""
----

. Check to see if applicable nodes now have the `infra` role and `app` roles:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----

. Create a default cluster-wide node selector. The default node selector is applied to pods created in all namespaces. This creates an intersection with any existing node selectors on a pod, which additionally constrains the pod's selector.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the default node selector key conflicts with the key of a pod's label, then the default node selector is not applied.

However, do not set a default node selector that might cause a pod to become unschedulable. For example, setting the default node selector to a specific node role, such as `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=""`, when a pod's label is set to a different node role, such as `node-role.kubernetes.io/master=""`, can cause the pod to become unschedulable. For this reason, use caution when setting the default node selector to specific node roles.

You can alternatively use a project node selector to avoid cluster-wide node selector key conflicts.
====

.. Edit the `Scheduler` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit scheduler cluster
----

.. Add the `defaultNodeSelector` field with the appropriate node selector:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Scheduler
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNodeSelector: topology.kubernetes.io/region=us-east-1 <1>
# ...
----
<1> This example node selector deploys pods on nodes in the `us-east-1` region by default.

.. Save the file to apply the changes.

You can now move infrastructure resources to the newly labeled `infra` nodes.

= Creating a machine config pool for infrastructure machines

If you need infrastructure machines to have dedicated configurations, you must create an infra pool.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Creating a custom machine configuration pool overrides default worker pool configurations if they refer to the same file or unit.
====

.Procedure

. Add a label to the node you want to assign as the infra node with a specific label:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node_name> <label>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node ci-ln-n8mqwr2-f76d1-xscn2-worker-c-6fmtx node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=
----

. Create a machine config pool that contains both the worker role and your custom role as machine config selector:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat infra.mcp.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  name: infra
spec:
  machineConfigSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role, operator: In, values: [worker,infra]} <1>
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: "" <2>
----
<1> Add the worker role and your custom role.
<2> Add the label you added to the node as a `nodeSelector`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Custom machine config pools inherit machine configs from the worker pool. Custom pools use any machine config targeted for the worker pool, but add the ability to also deploy changes that are targeted at only the custom pool. Because a custom pool inherits resources from the worker pool, any change to the worker pool also affects the custom pool.
====

. After you have the YAML file, you can create the machine config pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f infra.mcp.yaml
----

. Check the machine configs to ensure that the infrastructure configuration rendered successfully:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfig
----
+

You should see a new machine config, with the `rendered-infra-*` prefix.

. Optional: To deploy changes to a custom pool, create a machine config that uses the custom pool name as the label, such as `infra`. Note that this is not required and only shown for instructional purposes. In this manner, you can apply any custom configurations specific to only your infra nodes.

After you create the new machine config pool, the MCO generates a new rendered config for that pool, and associated nodes of that pool reboot to apply the new configuration.

[id="assigning-machine-set-resources-to-infra-nodes"]
== Assigning machine set resources to infrastructure nodes

After creating an infrastructure machine set, the `worker` and `infra` roles are applied to new infra nodes. Nodes with the `infra` role are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment, even when the `worker` role is also applied.

However, when an infra node is assigned the worker role, there is a chance that user workloads can get assigned inadvertently to the infra node. To avoid this, you can apply a taint to the infra node and tolerations for the pods that you want to control.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="binding-infra-node-workloads-using-taints-tolerations_{context}"]
= Binding infrastructure node workloads using taints and tolerations

If you have an infra node that has the `infra` and `worker` roles assigned, you must configure the node so that user workloads are not assigned to it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is recommended that you preserve the dual `infra,worker` label that is created for infra nodes and use taints and tolerations to manage nodes that user workloads are scheduled on. If you remove the `worker` label from the node, you must create a custom pool to manage it. A node with a label other than `master` or `worker` is not recognized by the MCO without a custom pool. Maintaining the `worker` label allows the node to be managed by the default worker machine config pool, if no custom pools that select the custom label exists. The `infra` label communicates to the cluster that it does not count toward the total number of subscriptions.
====

.Prerequisites

* Configure additional `MachineSet` objects in your {product-title} cluster.

.Procedure

. Add a taint to the infra node to prevent scheduling user workloads on it:

.. Determine if the node has the taint:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe nodes <node_name>
----
+
.Sample output
[source,text]
----
oc describe node ci-ln-iyhx092-f76d1-nvdfm-worker-b-wln2l
Name:               ci-ln-iyhx092-f76d1-nvdfm-worker-b-wln2l
Roles:              worker
 ...
Taints:             node-role.kubernetes.io/infra:NoSchedule
 ...
----
+
This example shows that the node has a taint. You can proceed with adding a toleration to your pod in the next step.

.. If you have not configured a taint to prevent scheduling user workloads on it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node_name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=reserved:NoExecute
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the taint:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Node
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: <node_name>
  labels:
    ...
spec:
  taints:
    - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
      effect: NoExecute
      value: reserved
  ...
----
====
+
This example places a taint on `node1` that has key `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` and taint effect `NoSchedule`. Nodes with the `NoSchedule` effect schedule only pods that tolerate the taint, but allow existing pods to remain scheduled on the node.
+
[NOTE]
====
If a descheduler is used, pods violating node taints could be evicted from the cluster.
====

. Add tolerations for the pod configurations you want to schedule on the infra node, like router, registry, and monitoring workloads. Add the following code to the `Pod` object specification:
+
[source,yaml]
----
tolerations:
  - effect: NoExecute <1>
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra <2>
    operator: Exists <3>
    value: reserved <4>
----
<1> Specify the effect that you added to the node.
<2> Specify the key that you added to the node.
<3> Specify the `Exists` Operator to require a taint with the key `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` to be present on the node.
<4> Specify the value of the key-value pair taint that you added to the node.
+
This toleration matches the taint created by the `oc adm taint` command. A pod with this toleration can be scheduled onto the infra node.
+
[NOTE]
====
Moving pods for an Operator installed via OLM to an infra node is not always possible. The capability to move Operator pods depends on the configuration of each Operator.
====

. Schedule the pod to the infra node using a scheduler. See the documentation for _Controlling pod placement onto nodes_ for details.

= About the cluster autoscaler

The cluster autoscaler adjusts the size of an {product-title} cluster to meet its current deployment needs. It uses declarative, Kubernetes-style arguments to provide infrastructure management that does not rely on objects of a specific cloud provider. The cluster autoscaler has a cluster scope, and is not associated with a particular namespace.

The cluster autoscaler increases the size of the cluster when there are pods that fail to schedule on any of the current worker nodes due to insufficient resources or when another node is necessary to meet deployment needs. The cluster autoscaler does not increase the cluster resources beyond the limits that you specify.

The cluster autoscaler computes the total
memory, CPU, and GPU
on all nodes the cluster, even though it does not manage the control plane nodes. These values are not single-machine oriented. They are an aggregation of all the resources in the entire cluster. For example, if you set the maximum memory resource limit, the cluster autoscaler includes all the nodes in the cluster when calculating the current memory usage. That calculation is then used to determine if the cluster autoscaler has the capacity to add more worker resources.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the `maxNodesTotal` value in the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource definition that you create is large enough to account for the total possible number of machines in your cluster. This value must encompass the number of control plane machines and the possible number of compute machines that you might scale to.
====

Every 10 seconds, the cluster autoscaler checks which nodes are unnecessary in the cluster and removes them. The cluster autoscaler considers a node for removal if the following conditions apply:

* The node utilization is less than the _node utilization level_ threshold for the cluster. The node utilization level is the sum of the requested resources divided by the allocated resources for the node. If you do not specify a value in the `ClusterAutoscaler` custom resource, the cluster autoscaler uses a default value of `0.5`, which corresponds to 50% utilization.
* The cluster autoscaler can move all pods running on the node to the other nodes. The Kubernetes scheduler is responsible for scheduling pods on the nodes.
* The cluster autoscaler does not have scale down disabled annotation.

If the following types of pods are present on a node, the cluster autoscaler will not remove the node:

* Pods with restrictive pod disruption budgets (PDBs).
* Kube-system pods that do not run on the node by default.
* Kube-system pods that do not have a PDB or have a PDB that is too restrictive.
* Pods that are not backed by a controller object such as a deployment, replica set, or stateful set.
* Pods with local storage.
* Pods that cannot be moved elsewhere because of a lack of resources, incompatible node selectors or affinity, matching anti-affinity, and so on.
* Unless they also have a `"cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict": "true"` annotation, pods that have a `"cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict": "false"` annotation.

For example, you set the maximum CPU limit to 64 cores and configure the cluster autoscaler to only create machines that have 8 cores each. If your cluster starts with 30 cores, the cluster autoscaler can add up to 4 more nodes with 32 cores, for a total of 62.

If you configure the cluster autoscaler, additional usage restrictions apply:

* Do not modify the nodes that are in autoscaled node groups directly. All nodes within the same node group have the same capacity and labels and run the same system pods.
* Specify requests for your pods.
* If you have to prevent pods from being deleted too quickly, configure appropriate PDBs.
* Confirm that your cloud provider quota is large enough to support the maximum node pools that you configure.
* Do not run additional node group autoscalers, especially the ones offered by your cloud provider.

The horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) and the cluster autoscaler modify cluster resources in different ways. The HPA changes the deployment's or replica set's number of replicas based on the current CPU load. If the load increases, the HPA creates new replicas, regardless of the amount of resources available to the cluster. If there are not enough resources, the cluster autoscaler adds resources so that the HPA-created pods can run. If the load decreases, the HPA stops some replicas. If this action causes some nodes to be underutilized or completely empty, the cluster autoscaler deletes the unnecessary nodes.

The cluster autoscaler takes pod priorities into account. The Pod Priority and Preemption feature enables scheduling pods based on priorities if the cluster does not have enough resources, but the cluster autoscaler ensures that the cluster has resources to run all pods. To honor the intention of both features, the cluster autoscaler includes a priority cutoff function. You can use this cutoff to schedule "best-effort" pods, which do not cause the cluster autoscaler to increase resources but instead run only when spare resources are available.

Pods with priority lower than the cutoff value do not cause the cluster to scale up or prevent the cluster from scaling down. No new nodes are added to run the pods, and nodes running these pods might be deleted to free resources.

Cluster autoscaling is supported for the platforms that have machine API available on it.

////
Default priority cutoff is 0. It can be changed using `--expendable-pods-priority-cutoff` flag, but we discourage it. cluster autoscaler also doesn't trigger scale-up if an unschedulable Pod is already waiting for a lower priority Pod preemption.

The node utilization level is the sum of the requested resources divided by the allocated resources for the node, and must be a value greater than `"0"` but less than `"1"`. If you do not specify a value, the cluster autoscaler uses a default value of `"0.5"`, which corresponds to 50% utilization. This value must be expressed as a string.
// Might be able to add a formula to show this visually, but need to look into asciidoc math formatting and what our tooling supports.

[NOTE]
====
When performing a scaling operation, the cluster autoscaler remains within the ranges set in the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource definition, such as the minimum and maximum number of cores to deploy or the amount of memory in the cluster. However, the cluster autoscaler does not correct the current values in your cluster to be within those ranges.

The minimum and maximum CPUs, memory, and GPU values are determined by calculating those resources on all nodes in the cluster, even if the cluster autoscaler does not manage the nodes. For example, the control plane nodes are considered in the total memory in the cluster, even though the cluster autoscaler does not manage the control plane nodes.

= About the machine autoscaler

The machine autoscaler adjusts the number of Machines in the compute machine sets that you deploy in an {product-title} cluster. You can scale both the default `worker` compute machine set and any other compute machine sets that you create. The machine autoscaler makes more Machines when the cluster runs out of resources to support more deployments. Any changes to the values in `MachineAutoscaler` resources, such as the minimum or maximum number of instances, are immediately applied to the compute machine set they target.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must deploy a machine autoscaler for the cluster autoscaler to scale your machines. The cluster autoscaler uses the annotations on compute machine sets that the machine autoscaler sets to determine the resources that it can scale. If you define a cluster autoscaler without also defining machine autoscalers, the cluster autoscaler will never scale your cluster.

= Configuring Linux cgroup

As of {product-title} 4.14, {product-title} uses link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html[Linux control group version 2] (cgroup v2) in your cluster. If you are using cgroup v1 on {product-title} 4.13 or earlier, migrating to {product-title} 4.14 or later will not automatically update your cgroup configuration to version 2. A fresh installation of {product-title} 4.14 or later will use cgroup v2 by default. However, you can enable link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/index.html[Linux control group version 1] (cgroup v1) upon installation.

cgroup v2 is the current version of the Linux cgroup API. cgroup v2 offers several improvements over cgroup v1, including a unified hierarchy, safer sub-tree delegation, new features such as link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/accounting/psi.html[Pressure Stall Information], and enhanced resource management and isolation. However, cgroup v2 has different CPU, memory, and I/O management characteristics than cgroup v1. Therefore, some workloads might experience slight differences in memory or CPU usage on clusters that run cgroup v2.

You can change between cgroup v1 and cgroup v2, as needed. Enabling cgroup v1 in {product-title} disables all cgroup v2 controllers and hierarchies in your cluster.


[NOTE]
====
Currently, disabling CPU load balancing is not supported by cgroup v2. As a result, you might not get the desired behavior from performance profiles if you have cgroup v2 enabled. Enabling cgroup v2 is not recommended if you are using performance profiles.
====

.Prerequisites
* You have a running {product-title} cluster that uses version 4.12 or later.
* You are logged in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

= Understanding feature gates

You can use the `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR) to enable specific feature sets in your cluster. A feature set is a collection of {product-title} features that are not enabled by default.

You can activate the following feature set by using the `FeatureGate` CR:

* `TechPreviewNoUpgrade`. This feature set is a subset of the current Technology Preview features. This feature set allows you to enable these Technology Preview features on test clusters, where you can fully test them, while leaving the features disabled on production clusters.
+
[WARNING]
====
Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set on your cluster cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. You should not enable this feature set on production clusters.
====
+
The following Technology Preview features are enabled by this feature set:
+
--
** External cloud providers. Enables support for external cloud providers for clusters on vSphere, AWS, Azure, and GCP. Support for OpenStack is GA. This is an internal feature that most users do not need to interact with. (`ExternalCloudProvider`)
** Shared Resources CSI Driver in OpenShift Builds. Enables the Container Storage Interface (CSI). (`CSIDriverSharedResource`)
** Swap memory on nodes. Enables swap memory use for {product-title} workloads on a per-node basis. (`NodeSwap`)
** OpenStack Machine API Provider. This gate has no effect and is planned to be removed from this feature set in a future release. (`MachineAPIProviderOpenStack`)
** Insights Operator. Enables the Insights Operator, which gathers {product-title} configuration data and sends it to Red Hat. (`InsightsConfigAPI`)
** Retroactive Default Storage Class. Enables {product-title} to retroactively assign the default storage class to PVCs if there was no default storage class when the PVC was created.(`RetroactiveDefaultStorageClass`)
** Dynamic Resource Allocation API. Enables a new API for requesting and sharing resources between pods and containers. This is an internal feature that most users do not need to interact with. (`DynamicResourceAllocation`)
** Pod security admission enforcement. Enables the restricted enforcement mode for pod security admission. Instead of only logging a warning, pods are rejected if they violate pod security standards. (`OpenShiftPodSecurityAdmission`)
** StatefulSet pod availability upgrading limits. Enables users to define the maximum number of statefulset pods unavailable during updates which reduces application downtime. (`MaxUnavailableStatefulSet`)
** Admin Network Policy and Baseline Admin Network Policy. Enables `AdminNetworkPolicy` and `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` resources, which are part of the Network Policy V2 API, in clusters running the OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin. Cluster administrators can apply cluster-scoped policies and safeguards for an entire cluster before namespaces are created. Network administrators can secure clusters by enforcing network traffic controls that cannot be overridden by users. Network administrators can enforce optional baseline network traffic controls that can be overridden by users in the cluster, if necessary. Currently, these APIs support only expressing policies for intra-cluster traffic. (`AdminNetworkPolicy`)
** `MatchConditions` is a list of conditions that must be met for a request to be sent to this webhook. Match conditions filter requests that have already been matched by the rules, namespaceSelector, and objectSelector. An empty list of `matchConditions` matches all requests. (`admissionWebhookMatchConditions`)
** Gateway API. To enable the {product-title} Gateway API, set the value of the `enabled` field to `true` in the `techPreview.gatewayAPI` specification of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.(`gateGatewayAPI`)
** `gcpLabelsTags`
** `vSphereStaticIPs`
** `routeExternalCertificate`
** `automatedEtcdBackup`
** `gcpClusterHostedDNS`
** `vSphereControlPlaneMachineset`
** `dnsNameResolver`
** `machineConfigNodes`
** `metricsServer`
** `installAlternateInfrastructureAWS`
** `sdnLiveMigration`
** `mixedCPUsAllocation`
** `managedBootImages`
** `onClusterBuild`
** `signatureStores`

[id="about-etcd_{context}"]
= About etcd encryption

By default, etcd data is not encrypted in {product-title}. You can enable etcd encryption for your cluster to provide an additional layer of data security. For example, it can help protect the loss of sensitive data if an etcd backup is exposed to the incorrect parties.

When you enable etcd encryption, the following OpenShift API server and Kubernetes API server resources are encrypted:

* Secrets
* Config maps
* Routes
* OAuth access tokens
* OAuth authorize tokens

When you enable etcd encryption, encryption keys are created. You must have these keys to restore from an etcd backup.

[NOTE]
====
Etcd encryption only encrypts values, not keys. Resource types, namespaces, and object names are unencrypted.

If etcd encryption is enabled during a backup, the `__static_kuberesources_<datetimestamp>.tar.gz__` file contains the encryption keys for the etcd snapshot. For security reasons, store this file separately from the etcd snapshot. However, this file is required to restore a previous state of etcd from the respective etcd snapshot.

= Enabling etcd encryption

You can enable etcd encryption to encrypt sensitive resources in your cluster.

[WARNING]
====
Do not back up etcd resources until the initial encryption process is completed. If the encryption process is not completed, the backup might be only partially encrypted.

After you enable etcd encryption, several changes can occur:

* The etcd encryption might affect the memory consumption of a few resources.
* You might notice a transient affect on backup performance because the leader must serve the backup.
* A disk I/O can affect the node that receives the backup state.
====

You can encrypt the etcd database in either AES-GCM or AES-CBC encryption.

[NOTE]
====
To migrate your etcd database from one encryption type to the other, you can modify the API server's `spec.encryption.type` field. Migration of the etcd data to the new encryption type occurs automatically.
====

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Modify the `APIServer` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit apiserver
----

. Set the `spec.encryption.type` field to `aesgcm` or `aescbc`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  encryption:
    type: aesgcm <1>
----
<1> Set to `aesgcm` for AES-GCM encryption or `aescbc` for AES-CBC encryption.

. Save the file to apply the changes.
+
The encryption process starts. It can take 20 minutes or longer for this process to complete, depending on the size of the etcd database.

. Verify that etcd encryption was successful.

.. Review the `Encrypted` status condition for the OpenShift API server to verify that its resources were successfully encrypted:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get openshiftapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'

All resources encrypted: routes.route.openshift.io
----
+
If the output shows `EncryptionInProgress`, encryption is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.

.. Review the `Encrypted` status condition for the Kubernetes API server to verify that its resources were successfully encrypted:

= Disabling etcd encryption

You can disable encryption of etcd data in your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Modify the `APIServer` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit apiserver
----

. Set the `encryption` field type to `identity`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  encryption:
    type: identity <1>
----
<1> The `identity` type is the default value and means that no encryption is performed.

. Save the file to apply the changes.
+
The decryption process starts. It can take 20 minutes or longer for this process to complete, depending on the size of your cluster.

. Verify that etcd decryption was successful.

.. Review the `Encrypted` status condition for the OpenShift API server to verify that its resources were successfully decrypted:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get openshiftapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
----
+
The output shows `DecryptionCompleted` upon successful decryption:
+
[source,terminal]
----
DecryptionCompleted
Encryption mode set to identity and everything is decrypted
----
+
If the output shows `DecryptionInProgress`, decryption is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.

.. Review the `Encrypted` status condition for the Kubernetes API server to verify that its resources were successfully decrypted:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get kubeapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
----
+
The output shows `DecryptionCompleted` upon successful decryption:
+
[source,terminal]
----
DecryptionCompleted
Encryption mode set to identity and everything is decrypted
----
+
If the output shows `DecryptionInProgress`, decryption is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.

.. Review the `Encrypted` status condition for the OpenShift OAuth API server to verify that its resources were successfully decrypted:
+

[id="backing-up-etcd-data_{context}"]
= Backing up etcd data

Follow these steps to back up etcd data by creating an etcd snapshot and backing up the resources for the static pods. This backup can be saved and used at a later time if you need to restore etcd.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only save a backup from a single control plane host. Do not take a backup from each control plane host in the cluster.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have checked whether the cluster-wide proxy is enabled.
+
[TIP]
====
You can check whether the proxy is enabled by reviewing the output of `oc get proxy cluster -o yaml`. The proxy is enabled if the `httpProxy`, `httpsProxy`, and `noProxy` fields have values set.
====

.Procedure

. Start a debug session as root for a control plane node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug --as-root node/<node_name>
----

. Change your root directory to `/host` in the debug shell:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# chroot /host
----

. If the cluster-wide proxy is enabled, be sure that you have exported the `NO_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.

. Run the `cluster-backup.sh` script in the debug shell and pass in the location to save the backup to.
+
[TIP]
====
The `cluster-backup.sh` script is maintained as a component of the etcd Cluster Operator and is a wrapper around the `etcdctl snapshot save` command.

+
[NOTE]
====
If etcd encryption is enabled, it is recommended to store this second file separately from the etcd snapshot for security reasons. However, this file is required to restore from the etcd snapshot.

Keep in mind that etcd encryption only encrypts values, not keys. This means that resource types, namespaces, and object names are unencrypted.

[id="etcd-defrag_{context}"]
= Defragmenting etcd data

For large and dense clusters, etcd can suffer from poor performance if the keyspace grows too large and exceeds the space quota. Periodically maintain and defragment etcd to free up space in the data store. Monitor Prometheus for etcd metrics and defragment it when required; otherwise, etcd can raise a cluster-wide alarm that puts the cluster into a maintenance mode that accepts only key reads and deletes.

Monitor these key metrics:

* `etcd_server_quota_backend_bytes`, which is the current quota limit
* `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_use_in_bytes`, which indicates the actual database usage after a history compaction
* `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes`, which shows the database size, including free space waiting for defragmentation

Defragment etcd data to reclaim disk space after events that cause disk fragmentation, such as etcd history compaction.

History compaction is performed automatically every five minutes and leaves gaps in the back-end database. This fragmented space is available for use by etcd, but is not available to the host file system. You must defragment etcd to make this space available to the host file system.

Defragmentation occurs automatically, but you can also trigger it manually.

[NOTE]
====
Automatic defragmentation is good for most cases, because the etcd operator uses cluster information to determine the most efficient operation for the user.
====

[id="automatic-defrag-etcd-data_{context}"]
== Automatic defragmentation

The etcd Operator automatically defragments disks. No manual intervention is needed.

Verify that the defragmentation process is successful by viewing one of these logs:

* etcd logs
* cluster-etcd-operator pod
* operator status error log

[WARNING]
====
Automatic defragmentation can cause leader election failure in various OpenShift core components, such as the Kubernetes controller manager, which triggers a restart of the failing component. The restart is harmless and either triggers failover to the next running instance or the component resumes work again after the restart.
====

[id="manual-defrag-etcd-data_{context}"]
== Manual defragmentation

//You can monitor the `etcd_db_total_size_in_bytes` metric to determine whether manual defragmentation is necessary.

A Prometheus alert indicates when you need to use manual defragmentation. The alert is displayed in two cases:

   * When etcd uses more than 50% of its available space for more than 10 minutes
   * When etcd is actively using less than 50% of its total database size for more than 10 minutes

You can also determine whether defragmentation is needed by checking the etcd database size in MB that will be freed by defragmentation with the PromQL expression: `(etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes - etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_use_in_bytes)/1024/1024`

[WARNING]
====
Defragmenting etcd is a blocking action. The etcd member will not respond until defragmentation is complete. For this reason, wait at least one minute between defragmentation actions on each of the pods to allow the cluster to recover.
====

Follow this procedure to defragment etcd data on each etcd member.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Determine which etcd member is the leader, because the leader should be defragmented last.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="dr-scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state_{context}"]
= Restoring to a previous cluster state

You can use a saved `etcd` backup to restore a previous cluster state or restore a cluster that has lost the majority of control plane hosts.

[NOTE]
====
If your cluster uses a control plane machine set, see "Troubleshooting the control plane machine set" for a more simple `etcd` recovery procedure.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you restore your cluster, you must use an `etcd` backup that was taken from the same z-stream release. For example, an {product-title} 4.7.2 cluster must use an `etcd` backup that was taken from 4.7.2.
====

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role through a certificate-based `kubeconfig` file, like the one that was used during installation.
* A healthy control plane host to use as the recovery host.
* SSH access to control plane hosts.
* A backup directory containing both the `etcd` snapshot and the resources for the static pods, which were from the same backup. The file names in the directory must be in the following formats: `snapshot_<datetimestamp>.db` and `static_kuberesources_<datetimestamp>.tar.gz`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For non-recovery control plane nodes, it is not required to establish SSH connectivity or to stop the static pods. You can delete and recreate other non-recovery, control plane machines, one by one.
====

.Procedure

. Select a control plane host to use as the recovery host. This is the host that you will run the restore operation on.

. Establish SSH connectivity to each of the control plane nodes, including the recovery host.
+
`kube-apiserver` becomes inaccessible after the restore process starts, so you cannot access the control plane nodes. For this reason, it is recommended to establish SSH connectivity to each control plane host in a separate terminal.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not complete this step, you will not be able to access the control plane hosts to complete the restore procedure, and you will be unable to recover your cluster from this state.
====

. Copy the `etcd` backup directory to the recovery control plane host.
+
This procedure assumes that you copied the `backup` directory containing the `etcd` snapshot and the resources for the static pods to the `/home/core/` directory of your recovery control plane host.

. Stop the static pods on any other control plane nodes.
+
[NOTE]
====
You do not need to stop the static pods on the recovery host.
====

.. Access a control plane host that is not the recovery host.

.. Move the existing etcd pod file out of the kubelet manifest directory by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd-pod.yaml /tmp
----

.. Verify that the `etcd` pods are stopped by using:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo crictl ps | grep etcd | egrep -v "operator|etcd-guard"
----
+
If the output of this command is not empty, wait a few minutes and check again.

.. Move the existing `kube-apiserver` file out of the kubelet manifest directory by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver-pod.yaml /tmp
----

.. Verify that the `kube-apiserver` containers are stopped by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver | egrep -v "operator|guard"
----
+
If the output of this command is not empty, wait a few minutes and check again.

.. Move the existing `kube-controller-manager` file out of the kubelet manifest directory by using:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager-pod.yaml /tmp
----

.. Verify that the `kube-controller-manager` containers are stopped by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo crictl ps | grep kube-controller-manager | egrep -v "operator|guard"
----
If the output of this command is not empty, wait a few minutes and check again.

.. Move the existing `kube-scheduler` file out of the kubelet manifest directory by using:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler-pod.yaml /tmp
----

.. Verify that the `kube-scheduler` containers are stopped by using:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo crictl ps | grep kube-scheduler | egrep -v "operator|guard"
----
If the output of this command is not empty, wait a few minutes and check again.

.. Move the `etcd` data directory to a different location with the following example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mv /var/lib/etcd/ /tmp
----

.. If the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/keepalived.yaml` file exists, follow these steps:

... Move the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/keepalived.yaml` file out of the kubelet manifest directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/keepalived.yaml /tmp
----

... Verify that any containers managed by the `keepalived` daemon are stopped:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo crictl ps --name keepalived
----
+
The output of this command should be empty. If it is not empty, wait a few minutes and check again.

... Check if the control plane has any Virtual IPs (VIPs) assigned to it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ip -o address | egrep '<api_vip>|<ingress_vip>'
----

... For each reported VIP, run the following command to remove it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo ip address del <reported_vip> dev <reported_vip_device>
----

.. Repeat this step on each of the other control plane hosts that is not the recovery host.

. Access the recovery control plane host.

. If the `keepalived` daemon is in use, verify that the recovery control plane node owns the VIP:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ip -o address | grep <api_vip>
----
+
The address of the VIP is highlighted in the output if it exists. This command returns an empty string if the VIP is not set or configured incorrectly.

. If the cluster-wide proxy is enabled, be sure that you have exported the `NO_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.
+
[TIP]
====
You can check whether the proxy is enabled by reviewing the output of `oc get proxy cluster -o yaml`. The proxy is enabled if the `httpProxy`, `httpsProxy`, and `noProxy` fields have values set.
====

. Run the restore script on the recovery control plane host and pass in the path to the `etcd` backup directory:

.Restart OVN-Kubernetes pods in the following order:
. The recovery control plane host
. The other control plane hosts (if available)
. The other nodes
====

[NOTE]
====
Validating and mutating admission webhooks can reject pods. If you add any additional webhooks with the `failurePolicy` set to `Fail`, then they can reject pods and the restoration process can fail. You can avoid this by saving and deleting webhooks while restoring the cluster state. After the cluster state is restored successfully, you can enable the webhooks again.

Alternatively, you can temporarily set the `failurePolicy` to `Ignore` while restoring the cluster state. After the cluster state is restored successfully, you can set the `failurePolicy` to `Fail`.

[id="dr-scenario-cluster-state-issues_{context}"]
= Issues and workarounds for restoring a persistent storage state

If your {product-title} cluster uses persistent storage of any form, a state of the cluster is typically stored outside etcd. It might be an Elasticsearch cluster running in a pod or a database running in a `StatefulSet` object. When you restore from an etcd backup, the status of the workloads in {product-title} is also restored. However, if the etcd snapshot is old, the status might be invalid or outdated.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The contents of persistent volumes (PVs) are never part of the etcd snapshot. When you restore an {product-title} cluster from an etcd snapshot, non-critical workloads might gain access to critical data, or vice-versa.
====

The following are some example scenarios that produce an out-of-date status:

* MySQL database is running in a pod backed up by a PV object. Restoring {product-title} from an etcd snapshot does not bring back the volume on the storage provider, and does not produce a running MySQL pod, despite the pod repeatedly attempting to start. You must manually restore this pod by restoring the volume on the storage provider, and then editing the PV to point to the new volume.

* Pod P1 is using volume A, which is attached to node X. If the etcd snapshot is taken while another pod uses the same volume on node Y, then when the etcd restore is performed, pod P1 might not be able to start correctly due to the volume still being attached to node Y. {product-title} is not aware of the attachment, and does not automatically detach it. When this occurs, the volume must be manually detached from node Y so that the volume can attach on node X, and then pod P1 can start.

* Cloud provider or storage provider credentials were updated after the etcd snapshot was taken. This causes any CSI drivers or Operators that depend on the those credentials to not work. You might have to manually update the credentials required by those drivers or Operators.

* A device is removed or renamed from {product-title} nodes after the etcd snapshot is taken. The Local Storage Operator creates symlinks for each PV that it manages from `/dev/disk/by-id` or `/dev` directories. This situation might cause the local PVs to refer to devices that no longer exist.
+
To fix this problem, an administrator must:

. Manually remove the PVs with invalid devices.
. Remove symlinks from respective nodes.
. Delete `LocalVolume` or `LocalVolumeSet` objects (see _Storage_ -> _Configuring persistent storage_ -> _Persistent storage using local volumes_ -> _Deleting the Local Storage Operator Resources_).

= Understanding how to use pod disruption budgets to specify the number of pods that must be up

A _pod disruption budget_ allows the specification of safety constraints on pods during operations, such as draining a node for maintenance.

`PodDisruptionBudget` is an API object that specifies the minimum number or
percentage of replicas that must be up at a time. Setting these in projects can
be helpful during node maintenance (such as scaling a cluster down or a cluster
upgrade) and is only honored on voluntary evictions (not on node failures).

A `PodDisruptionBudget` object's configuration consists of the following key
parts:

* A label selector, which is a label query over a set of pods.
* An availability level, which specifies the minimum number of pods that must be
 available simultaneously, either:
** `minAvailable` is the number of pods must always be available, even during a disruption.
** `maxUnavailable` is the number of pods can be unavailable during a disruption.

[NOTE]
====
`Available` refers to the number of pods that has condition `Ready=True`.
`Ready=True` refers to the pod that is able to serve requests and should be added to the load balancing pools of all matching services.

A `maxUnavailable` of `0%` or `0` or a `minAvailable` of `100%` or equal to the number of replicas
is permitted but can block nodes from being drained.
====

You can check for pod disruption budgets across all projects with the following:

The `PodDisruptionBudget` is considered healthy when there are at least
`minAvailable` pods running in the system. Every pod above that limit can be evicted.

Depending on your pod priority and preemption settings,
lower-priority pods might be removed despite their pod disruption budget requirements.

To configure a pod disruption budget:

. Create a YAML file with the an object definition similar to the following:
+

[id="pod-disruption-eviction-policy_{context}"]
= Specifying the eviction policy for unhealthy pods

When you use pod disruption budgets (PDBs) to specify how many pods must be available simultaneously, you can also define the criteria for how unhealthy pods are considered for eviction.

You can choose one of the following policies:

IfHealthyBudget:: Running pods that are not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not disrupted.

AlwaysAllow:: Running pods that are not yet healthy can be evicted regardless of whether the criteria in the pod disruption budget is met. This policy can help evict malfunctioning applications, such as ones with pods stuck in the `CrashLoopBackOff` state or failing to report the `Ready` status.
+
[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to set the `unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy` field to `AlwaysAllow` in the `PodDisruptionBudget` object to support the eviction of misbehaving applications during a node drain. The default behavior is to wait for the application pods to become healthy before the drain can proceed.
====

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file that defines a `PodDisruptionBudget` object and specify the unhealthy pod eviction policy:
+
.Example `pod-disruption-budget.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget

  unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy: AlwaysAllow <1>
----
<1> Choose either `IfHealthyBudget` or `AlwaysAllow` as the unhealthy pod eviction policy. The default is `IfHealthyBudget` when the `unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy` field is empty.

. Create the `PodDisruptionBudget` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f pod-disruption-budget.yaml
----

With a PDB that has the `AlwaysAllow` unhealthy pod eviction policy set, you can now drain nodes and evict the pods for a malfunctioning application guarded by this PDB.

[id="manually-rotating-cloud-creds_{context}"]
= Rotating cloud provider credentials manually

If your cloud provider credentials are changed for any reason, you must manually update the secret that the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) uses to manage cloud provider credentials.

The process for rotating cloud credentials depends on the mode that the CCO is configured to use. After you rotate credentials for a cluster that is using mint mode, you must manually remove the component credentials that were created by the removed credential.

////
[NOTE]
====
You can also use the command line interface to complete all parts of this procedure.
====
////

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster is installed on a platform that supports rotating cloud credentials manually with the CCO mode that you are using:

** For mint mode, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are supported.

** For passthrough mode, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), {rh-openstack-first}, and VMware vSphere are supported.

* You have changed the credentials that are used to interface with your cloud provider.

* The new credentials have sufficient permissions for the mode CCO is configured to use in your cluster.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Workloads* -> *Secrets*.

. In the table on the *Secrets* page, find the root secret for your cloud provider.
+
[cols=2,options=header]
|===

|Azure
|`azure-credentials`

|GCP
|`gcp-credentials`

|{rh-openstack}
|`openstack-credentials`

|VMware vSphere
|`vsphere-creds`

|===

. Click the *Options* menu {kebab} in the same row as the secret and select *Edit Secret*.

. Record the contents of the *Value* field or fields. You can use this information to verify that the value is different after updating the credentials.

. Update the text in the *Value* field or fields with the new authentication information for your cloud provider, and then click *Save*.

. If you are updating the credentials for a vSphere cluster that does not have the vSphere CSI Driver Operator enabled, you must force a rollout of the Kubernetes controller manager to apply the updated credentials.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the vSphere CSI Driver Operator is enabled, this step is not required.
====
+
To apply the updated vSphere credentials, log in to the {product-title} CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role and run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch kubecontrollermanager cluster \
  -p='{"spec": {"forceRedeploymentReason": "recovery-'"$( date )"'"}}' \
  --type=merge
----
+
While the credentials are rolling out, the status of the Kubernetes Controller Manager Operator reports `Progressing=true`. To view the status, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get co kube-controller-manager
----

. If the CCO for your cluster is configured to use mint mode, delete each component secret that is referenced by the individual `CredentialsRequest` objects.

= Cluster Samples Operator assistance for mirroring

During installation, {product-title} creates a config map named `imagestreamtag-to-image` in the `openshift-cluster-samples-operator` namespace. The `imagestreamtag-to-image` config map contains an entry, the populating image, for each image stream tag.

The format of the key for each entry in the data field in the config map is `<image_stream_name>_<image_stream_tag_name>`.

During a disconnected installation of {product-title}, the status of the Cluster Samples Operator is set to `Removed`. If you choose to change it to `Managed`, it installs samples.
[NOTE]
====
The use of samples in a network-restricted or discontinued environment may require access to services external to your network. Some example services include: Github, Maven Central, npm, RubyGems, PyPi and others. There might be additional steps to take that allow the cluster samples operators's objects to reach the services they require.
====

You can use this config map as a reference for which images need to be mirrored for your image streams to import.

* While the Cluster Samples Operator is set to `Removed`, you can create your mirrored registry, or determine which existing mirrored registry you want to use.
* Mirror the samples you want to the mirrored registry using the new config map as your guide.
* Add any of the image streams you did not mirror to the `skippedImagestreams` list of the Cluster Samples Operator configuration object.
* Set `samplesRegistry` of the Cluster Samples Operator configuration object to the mirrored registry.
* Then set the Cluster Samples Operator to `Managed` to install the image streams you have mirrored.

The Cluster Samples Operator must be set to `Managed` in a disconnected environment. To install the image streams, you have a mirrored registry.
====

.Prerequisites
* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* Create a pull secret for your mirror registry.

.Procedure

. Access the images of a specific image stream to mirror, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get is <imagestream> -n openshift -o json | jq .spec.tags[].from.name | grep registry.redhat.io
----
+
. Mirror images from link:https://registry.redhat.io[registry.redhat.io] associated with any image streams you need
in the restricted network environment into one of the defined mirrors, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image mirror registry.redhat.io/rhscl/ruby-25-rhel7:latest ${MIRROR_ADDR}/rhscl/ruby-25-rhel7:latest
----

. Create the cluster's image configuration object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap registry-config --from-file=${MIRROR_ADDR_HOSTNAME}..5000=$path/ca.crt -n openshift-config
----

. Add the required trusted CAs for the mirror in the cluster's image
configuration object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch image.config.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"additionalTrustedCA":{"name":"registry-config"}}}' --type=merge
----

. Update the `samplesRegistry` field in the Cluster Samples Operator configuration object
to contain the `hostname` portion of the mirror location defined in the mirror
configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit configs.samples.operator.openshift.io -n openshift-cluster-samples-operator
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This is required because the image stream import process does not use the mirror or search mechanism at this time.
====
+
. Add any image streams that are not mirrored into the `skippedImagestreams` field
of the Cluster Samples Operator configuration object. Or if you do not want to support
any of the sample image streams, set the Cluster Samples Operator to `Removed` in the
Cluster Samples Operator configuration object.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Cluster Samples Operator issues alerts if image stream imports are failing but the Cluster Samples Operator is either periodically retrying or does not appear to be retrying them.
====
+
Many of the templates in the `openshift` namespace
reference the image streams. So using `Removed` to purge both the image streams
and templates will eliminate the possibility of attempts to use them if they
are not functional because of any missing image streams.

[id="installation-preparing-restricted-cluster-to-gather-support-data_{context}"]
= Preparing your cluster to gather support data

Clusters using a restricted network must import the default must-gather image to gather debugging data for Red Hat support. The must-gather image is not imported by default, and clusters on a restricted network do not have access to the internet to pull the latest image from a remote repository.

.Procedure

. If you have not added your mirror registry's trusted CA to your cluster's image configuration object as part of the Cluster Samples Operator configuration, perform the following steps:
.. Create the cluster's image configuration object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap registry-config --from-file=${MIRROR_ADDR_HOSTNAME}..5000=$path/ca.crt -n openshift-config
----

.. Add the required trusted CAs for the mirror in the cluster's image
configuration object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch image.config.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"additionalTrustedCA":{"name":"registry-config"}}}' --type=merge
----

. Import the default must-gather image from your installation payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc import-image is/must-gather -n openshift
----

When running the `oc adm must-gather` command, use the `--image` flag and point to the payload image, as in the following example:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image=$(oc adm release info --image-for must-gather)

[id="images-cluster-sample-imagestream-import_{context}"]
= Configuring periodic importing of Cluster Sample Operator image stream tags

You can ensure that you always have access to the latest versions of the Cluster Sample Operator images by periodically importing the image stream tags when new versions become available.

.Procedure

. Fetch all the imagestreams in the `openshift` namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc get imagestreams -nopenshift
----

. Fetch the tags for every imagestream in the `openshift` namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get is <image-stream-name> -o jsonpath="{range .spec.tags[*]}{.name}{'\t'}{.from.name}{'\n'}{end}" -nopenshift
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get is ubi8-openjdk-17 -o jsonpath="{range .spec.tags[*]}{.name}{'\t'}{.from.name}{'\n'}{end}" -nopenshift
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
1.11	registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-17:1.11
1.12	registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-17:1.12
----

. Schedule periodic importing of images for each tag present in the image stream by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc tag <repository/image> <image-stream-name:tag> --scheduled -nopenshift
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc tag registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-17:1.11 ubi8-openjdk-17:1.11 --scheduled -nopenshift
$ oc tag registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-17:1.12 ubi8-openjdk-17:1.12 --scheduled -nopenshift
----
+
This command causes {product-title} to periodically update this particular image stream tag. This period is a cluster-wide setting set to 15 minutes by default.

. Verify the scheduling status of the periodic import by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc get imagestream <image-stream-name> -o jsonpath="{range .spec.tags[*]}Tag: {.name}{'\t'}Scheduled: {.importPolicy.scheduled}{'\n'}{end}" -nopenshift
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc get imagestream ubi8-openjdk-17 -o jsonpath="{range .spec.tags[*]}Tag: {.name}{'\t'}Scheduled: {.importPolicy.scheduled}{'\n'}{end}" -nopenshift
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Tag: 1.11	Scheduled: true
Tag: 1.12	Scheduled: true

[id="rhel-compute-overview_{context}"]
= About adding RHEL compute nodes to a cluster

In {product-title} {product-version}, you have the option of using {op-system-base-full} machines as compute machines in your cluster if you use a user-provisioned or installer-provisioned infrastructure installation on the `x86_64` architecture. You must use {op-system-first} machines for the control plane machines in your cluster.

If you choose to use {op-system-base} compute machines in your cluster, you are responsible for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance. You must perform system updates, apply patches, and complete all other required tasks.

For installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, you must manually add {op-system-base} compute machines because automatic scaling in installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters adds Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) compute machines by default.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Because removing {product-title} from a machine in the cluster requires destroying the operating system, you must use dedicated hardware for any {op-system-base} machines that you add to the cluster.

* Swap memory is disabled on all {op-system-base} machines that you add to your {product-title} cluster. You cannot enable swap memory on these machines.
====

You must add any {op-system-base} compute machines to the cluster after you initialize the control plane.

[id="rhel-compute-requirements_{context}"]
= System requirements for {op-system-base} compute nodes

The {op-system-base-full} compute machine hosts in your {product-title} environment must meet the following minimum hardware specifications and system-level requirements:

* You must have an active {product-title} subscription on your Red Hat account. If you do not, contact your sales representative for more information.

* Production environments must provide compute machines to support your expected workloads. As a cluster administrator, you must calculate the expected workload and add about 10% for overhead. For production environments, allocate enough resources so that a node host failure does not affect your maximum capacity.
* Each system must meet the following hardware requirements:
** Physical or virtual system, or an instance running on a public or private IaaS.
** Base OS: link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/performing_a_standard_rhel_installation/index[{op-system-base} 8.6 and later] with "Minimal" installation option.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Adding {op-system-base} 7 compute machines to an {product-title} cluster is not supported.

If you have {op-system-base} 7 compute machines that were previously supported in a past {product-title} version, you cannot upgrade them to {op-system-base} 8. You must deploy new {op-system-base} 8 hosts, and the old {op-system-base} 7 hosts should be removed. See the "Deleting nodes" section for more information.

For the most recent list of major functionality that has been deprecated or removed within {product-title}, refer to the _Deprecated and removed features_ section of the {product-title} release notes.
====
** If you deployed {product-title} in FIPS mode, you must enable FIPS on the {op-system-base} machine before you boot it. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/security_hardening/assembly_installing-a-rhel-8-system-with-fips-mode-enabled_security-hardening[Installing a RHEL 8 system with FIPS mode enabled] in the {op-system-base} 8 documentation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a {op-system-base-full} computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on RHEL, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/assembly_installing-the-system-in-fips-mode_security-hardening[Installing the system in FIPS mode]. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
====
** NetworkManager 1.0 or later.
** 1 vCPU.
** Minimum 8 GB RAM.
** Minimum 15 GB hard disk space for the file system containing `/var/`.
** Minimum 1 GB hard disk space for the file system containing `/usr/local/bin/`.
** Minimum 1 GB hard disk space for the file system containing its temporary directory. The temporary system directory is determined according to the rules defined in the tempfile module in the Python standard library.
* Each system must meet any additional requirements for your system provider. For example, if you installed your cluster on VMware vSphere, your disks must be configured according to its link:https://vmware.github.io/vsphere-storage-for-kubernetes/documentation/index.html[storage guidelines] and the `disk.enableUUID=true` attribute must be set.

* Each system must be able to access the cluster's API endpoints by using DNS-resolvable hostnames. Any network security access control that is in place must allow system access to the cluster's API service endpoints.

[id="csr-management_{context}"]
= Certificate signing requests management

Because your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management when you use infrastructure that you provision, you must provide a mechanism for approving cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation. The `kube-controller-manager` only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The `machine-approver` cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests and approving them.

[id="rhel-preparing-playbook-machine_{context}"]
= Preparing the machine to run the playbook

Before you can add compute machines that use {op-system-base-full} as the operating system to an {product-title} {product-version} cluster, you must prepare a {op-system-base} 8 machine to run an Ansible playbook that adds the new node to the cluster. This machine is not part of the cluster but must be able to access it.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) on the machine that you run the playbook on.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. Ensure that the `kubeconfig` file for the cluster and the installation program that you used to install the cluster are on the {op-system-base} 8 machine. One way to accomplish this is to use the same machine that you used to install the cluster.

. Configure the machine to access all of the {op-system-base} hosts that you plan to use as compute machines. You can use any method that your company allows, including a bastion with an SSH proxy or a VPN.

. Configure a user on the machine that you run the playbook on that has SSH access to all of the {op-system-base} hosts.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you use SSH key-based authentication, you must manage the key with an SSH agent.
====

. If you have not already done so, register the machine with RHSM and attach a pool with an `OpenShift` subscription to it:
.. Register the machine with RHSM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager register --username=<user_name> --password=<password>
----

.. Pull the latest subscription data from RHSM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager refresh
----

.. List the available subscriptions:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager list --available --matches '*OpenShift*'
----

.. In the output for the previous command, find the pool ID for an {product-title} subscription and attach it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----

. Enable the repositories required by {product-title} {product-version}:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms" \
    --enable="rhocp-{product-version}-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms"
----

. Install the required packages, including `openshift-ansible`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# yum install openshift-ansible openshift-clients jq
----
+
The `openshift-ansible` package provides installation program utilities and pulls in other packages that you require to add a {op-system-base} compute node to your cluster, such as Ansible, playbooks, and related configuration files. The `openshift-clients` provides the `oc` CLI, and the `jq` package improves the display of JSON output on your command line.

= Preparing a RHEL compute node

Before you add a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machine to your {product-title} cluster, you must register each host with Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM), attach an active {product-title} subscription, and enable the required repositories. Ensure `NetworkManager` is enabled and configured to control all interfaces on the host.

. On each host, register with RHSM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager register --username=<user_name> --password=<password>
----

. Pull the latest subscription data from RHSM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager refresh
----

. List the available subscriptions:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager list --available --matches '*OpenShift*'
----

. In the output for the previous command, find the pool ID for an {product-title} subscription and attach it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----

. Disable all yum repositories:
.. Disable all the enabled RHSM repositories:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="*"
----

.. List the remaining yum repositories and note their names under `repo id`, if any:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# yum repolist
----

.. Use `yum-config-manager` to disable the remaining yum repositories:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# yum-config-manager --disable <repo_id>
----
+
Alternatively, disable all repositories:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# yum-config-manager --disable \*
----
+
Note that this might take a few minutes if you have a large number of available repositories

. Enable only the repositories required by {product-title} {product-version}:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms" \
    --enable="rhocp-{product-version}-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms" \
    --enable="fast-datapath-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms"
----

. Stop and disable firewalld on the host:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# systemctl disable --now firewalld.service
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You must not enable firewalld later. If you do, you cannot access {product-title} logs on the worker.

mycluster-rhel8-1.example.com
----
<1> Specify the user name that runs the Ansible tasks on the remote compute machines.
<2> If you do not specify `root` for the `ansible_user`, you must set `ansible_become` to `True` and assign the user sudo permissions.
<3> Specify the path and file name of the `kubeconfig` file for your cluster.
<4> List each RHEL machine to add to your cluster. You must provide the fully-qualified domain name for each host. This name is the hostname that the cluster uses to access the machine, so set the correct public or private name to access the machine.

. Navigate to the Ansible playbook directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible

== Adding {op-system} compute machines to an {product-title} cluster

You can add more {op-system-first} compute machines to your {product-title} cluster on bare metal.

Before you add more compute machines to a cluster that you installed on bare metal infrastructure, you must create {op-system} machines for it to use. You can either use an ISO image or network PXE booting to create the machines.

//Prerequisites also in adding-bare-metal-compute-user-infra.adoc
=== Prerequisites

* You installed a cluster on bare metal.
* You have installation media and {op-system-first} images that you used to create your cluster. If you do not have these files, you must obtain them by following the instructions in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/installing/#installing-bare-metal[installation procedure].

[id="machine-user-infra-machines-iso_{context}"]
= Creating {op-system} machines using an ISO image

You can create more {op-system-first} compute machines for your bare metal cluster by using an ISO image to create the machines.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the URL of the Ignition config file for the compute machines for your cluster. You uploaded this file to your HTTP server during installation.
* You must have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`)  installed.

.Procedure

. Extract the Ignition config file from the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc extract -n openshift-machine-api secret/worker-user-data-managed --keys=userData --to=- > worker.ign
----

. Upload the `worker.ign` Ignition config file you exported from your cluster to your HTTP server. Note the URLs of these files.

. You can validate that the ignition files are available on the URLs. The following example gets the Ignition config files for the compute node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -k http://<HTTP_server>/worker.ign
----

. You can access the ISO image for booting your new machine by running to following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
RHCOS_VHD_ORIGIN_URL=$(oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator get configmap/coreos-bootimages -o jsonpath='{.data.stream}' | jq -r '.architectures.<architecture>.artifacts.metal.formats.iso.disk.location')
----

. Use the ISO file to install {op-system} on more compute machines. Use the same method that you used when you created machines before you installed the cluster:
** Burn the ISO image to a disk and boot it directly.
** Use ISO redirection with a LOM interface.

. Boot the {op-system} ISO image without specifying any options, or interrupting the live boot sequence. Wait for the installer to boot into a shell prompt in the {op-system} live environment.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can interrupt the {op-system} installation boot process to add kernel arguments. However, for this ISO procedure you must use the `coreos-installer` command as outlined in the following steps, instead of adding kernel arguments.
====

. Run the `coreos-installer` command and specify the options that meet your installation requirements. At a minimum, you must specify the URL that points to the Ignition config file for the node type, and the device that you are installing to:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo coreos-installer install --ignition-url=http://<HTTP_server>/<node_type>.ign <device> --ignition-hash=sha512-<digest> <1><2>
----
<1> You must run the `coreos-installer` command by using `sudo`, because the `core` user does not have the required root privileges to perform the installation.
<2> The `--ignition-hash` option is required when the Ignition config file is obtained through an HTTP URL to validate the authenticity of the Ignition config file on the cluster node. `<digest>` is the Ignition config file SHA512 digest obtained in a preceding step.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to provide your Ignition config files through an HTTPS server that uses TLS, you can add the internal certificate authority (CA) to the system trust store before running `coreos-installer`.
====
+
The following example initializes a bootstrap node installation to the `/dev/sda` device. The Ignition config file for the bootstrap node is obtained from an HTTP web server with the IP address 192.168.1.2:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo coreos-installer install --ignition-url=http://192.168.1.2:80/installation_directory/bootstrap.ign /dev/sda --ignition-hash=sha512-a5a2d43879223273c9b60af66b44202a1d1248fc01cf156c46d4a79f552b6bad47bc8cc78ddf0116e80c59d2ea9e32ba53bc807afbca581aa059311def2c3e3b
----

. Monitor the progress of the {op-system} installation on the console of the machine.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the installation is successful on each node before commencing with the {product-title} installation. Observing the installation process can also help to determine the cause of {op-system} installation issues that might arise.
====

. Continue to create more compute machines for your cluster.

[id="installation-approve-csrs_{context}"]
= Approving the certificate signing requests for your machines

When you add machines to a cluster, two pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) are generated for each machine that you added. You must confirm that these CSRs are approved or, if necessary, approve them yourself. The client requests must be approved first, followed by the server requests.

.Prerequisites

* You added machines to your cluster.

.Procedure

. Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  63m  v1.28.5
master-1  Ready     master  63m  v1.28.5
master-2  Ready     master  64m  v1.28.5
----
+
The output lists all of the machines that you created.
+
[NOTE]
====
The preceding output might not include the compute nodes, also known as worker nodes, until some CSRs are approved.
====

. Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the `Pending` or `Approved` status for each machine that you added to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-8b2br   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
csr-8vnps   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
...
----
+
In this example, two machines are joining the cluster. You might see more approved CSRs in the list.

. If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:
+
[NOTE]
====
Because the CSRs rotate automatically, approve your CSRs within an hour of adding the machines to the cluster. If you do not approve them within an hour, the certificates will rotate, and more than two certificates will be present for each node. You must approve all of these certificates. After the client CSR is approved, the Kubelet creates a secondary CSR for the serving certificate, which requires manual approval. Then, subsequent serving certificate renewal requests are automatically approved by the `machine-approver` if the Kubelet requests a new certificate with identical parameters.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
For clusters running on platforms that are not machine API enabled, such as bare metal and other user-provisioned infrastructure, you must implement a method of automatically approving the kubelet serving certificate requests (CSRs). If a request is not approved, then the `oc exec`, `oc rsh`, and `oc logs` commands cannot succeed, because a serving certificate is required when the API server connects to the kubelet. Any operation that contacts the Kubelet endpoint requires this certificate approval to be in place. The method must watch for new CSRs, confirm that the CSR was submitted by the `node-bootstrapper` service account in the `system:node` or `system:admin` groups, and confirm the identity of the node.
====

** To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

** To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Some Operators might not become available until some CSRs are approved.
====

. Now that your client requests are approved, you must review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-bfd72   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-50-126.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending

...
----

. If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

** To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

** To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
----

. After all client and server CSRs have been approved, the machines have the `Ready` status. Verify this by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION

{product-title} supports partitioning devices during installation by using machine configs that are processed during the bootstrap. However, if you use `/var` partitioning, the device name must be determined at installation and cannot be changed. You cannot add different instance types as nodes if they have a different device naming schema. For example, if you configured the `/var` partition with the default AWS device name for `m4.large` instances, `dev/xvdb`, you cannot directly add an AWS `m5.large` instance, as `m5.large` instances use a `/dev/nvme1n1` device by default. The device might fail to partition due to the different naming schema.

The procedure in this section shows how to add a new {op-system-first} compute node with an instance that uses a different device name from what was configured at installation. You create a custom user data secret and configure a new compute machine set. These steps are specific to an AWS cluster. The principles apply to other cloud deployments also. However, the device naming schema is different for other deployments and should be determined on a per-case basis.

.Procedure

. On a command line, change to the `openshift-machine-api` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project openshift-machine-api
----

. Create a new secret from the `worker-user-data` secret:

.. Export the `userData` section of the secret to a text file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secret worker-user-data --template='{{index .data.userData | base64decode}}' | jq > userData.txt
----

.. Edit the text file to add the `storage`, `filesystems`, and `systemd` stanzas for the partitions you want to use for the new node. You can specify any link:https://coreos.github.io/ignition/configuration-v3_2/[Ignition configuration parameters] as needed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can use the advanced machine management and scaling capabilities only in clusters where the Machine API is operational. Clusters with user-provisioned infrastructure require additional validation and configuration to use the Machine API.

Clusters with the infrastructure platform type `none` cannot use the Machine API. This limitation applies even if the compute machines that are attached to the cluster are installed on a platform that supports the feature. This parameter cannot be changed after installation.

To view the platform type for your cluster, run the following command:

[id="machine-health-checks-about_{context}"]
= About machine health checks

[NOTE]
====
You can only apply a machine health check to machines that are managed by compute machine sets or control plane machine sets.
====

To monitor machine health, create a resource to define the configuration for a controller. Set a condition to check, such as staying in the `NotReady` status for five minutes or displaying a permanent condition in the node-problem-detector, and a label for the set of machines to monitor.

The controller that observes a `MachineHealthCheck` resource checks for the defined condition. If a machine fails the health check, the machine is automatically deleted and one is created to take its place. When a machine is deleted, you see a `machine deleted` event.

To limit disruptive impact of the machine deletion, the controller drains and deletes only one node at a time. If there are more unhealthy machines than the `maxUnhealthy` threshold allows for in the targeted pool of machines, remediation stops and therefore enables manual intervention.

[NOTE]
====
Consider the timeouts carefully, accounting for workloads and requirements.

* Long timeouts can result in long periods of downtime for the workload on the unhealthy machine.
* Too short timeouts can result in a remediation loop. For example, the timeout for checking the `NotReady` status must be long enough to allow the machine to complete the startup process.
====

To stop the check, remove the resource.

[id="machine-health-checks-limitations_{context}"]
== Limitations when deploying machine health checks

There are limitations to consider before deploying a machine health check:

* Only machines owned by a machine set are remediated by a machine health check.
* If the node for a machine is removed from the cluster, a machine health check considers the machine to be unhealthy and remediates it immediately.
* If the corresponding node for a machine does not join the cluster after the `nodeStartupTimeout`, the machine is remediated.
* A machine is remediated immediately if the `Machine` resource phase is `Failed`.

<2> Specify a label for the machine pool that you want to check.
<3> Specify the machine set to track in `<cluster_name>-<label>-<zone>` format. For example, `prod-node-us-east-1a`.
<4> Specify the timeout duration for a node condition. If a condition is met for the duration of the timeout, the machine will be remediated. Long timeouts can result in long periods of downtime for a workload on an unhealthy machine.
<5> Specify the amount of machines allowed to be concurrently remediated in the targeted pool. This can be set as a percentage or an integer. If the number of unhealthy machines exceeds the limit set by `maxUnhealthy`, remediation is not performed.
<6> Specify the timeout duration that a machine health check must wait for a node to join the cluster before a machine is determined to be unhealthy.

[NOTE]
====
The `matchLabels` are examples only; you must map your machine groups based on your specific needs.
====

[id="machine-health-checks-short-circuiting_{context}"]
== Short-circuiting machine health check remediation

Short-circuiting ensures that machine health checks remediate machines only when the cluster is healthy.
Short-circuiting is configured through the `maxUnhealthy` field in the `MachineHealthCheck` resource.

If the user defines a value for the `maxUnhealthy` field, before remediating any machines, the `MachineHealthCheck` compares the value of `maxUnhealthy` with the number of machines within its target pool that it has determined to be unhealthy. Remediation is not performed if the number of unhealthy machines exceeds the `maxUnhealthy` limit.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If `maxUnhealthy` is not set, the value defaults to `100%` and the machines are remediated regardless of the state of the cluster.
====

The appropriate `maxUnhealthy` value depends on the scale of the cluster you deploy and how many machines the `MachineHealthCheck` covers. For example, you can use the `maxUnhealthy` value to cover multiple compute machine sets across multiple availability zones so that if you lose an entire zone, your `maxUnhealthy` setting prevents further remediation within the cluster. In global Azure regions that do not have multiple availability zones, you can use availability sets to ensure high availability.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you configure a `MachineHealthCheck` resource for the control plane, set the value of `maxUnhealthy` to `1`.

This configuration ensures that the machine health check takes no action when multiple control plane machines appear to be unhealthy. Multiple unhealthy control plane machines can indicate that the etcd cluster is degraded or that a scaling operation to replace a failed machine is in progress.

If the etcd cluster is degraded, manual intervention might be required. If a scaling operation is in progress, the machine health check should allow it to finish.
====

The `maxUnhealthy` field can be set as either an integer or percentage.
There are different remediation implementations depending on the `maxUnhealthy` value.

=== Setting maxUnhealthy by using an absolute value

If `maxUnhealthy` is set to `2`:

* Remediation will be performed if 2 or fewer nodes are unhealthy
* Remediation will not be performed if 3 or more nodes are unhealthy

These values are independent of how many machines are being checked by the machine health check.

=== Setting maxUnhealthy by using percentages

If `maxUnhealthy` is set to `40%` and there are 25 machines being checked:

* Remediation will be performed if 10 or fewer nodes are unhealthy
* Remediation will not be performed if 11 or more nodes are unhealthy

If `maxUnhealthy` is set to `40%` and there are 6 machines being checked:

* Remediation will be performed if 2 or fewer nodes are unhealthy
* Remediation will not be performed if 3 or more nodes are unhealthy

[NOTE]
====
The allowed number of machines is rounded down when the percentage of `maxUnhealthy` machines that are checked is not a whole number.

[id="machineset-manually-scaling_{context}"]
= Scaling a compute machine set manually

To add or remove an instance of a machine in a compute machine set, you can manually scale the compute machine set.

This guidance is relevant to fully automated, installer-provisioned infrastructure installations. Customized, user-provisioned infrastructure installations do not have compute machine sets.

.Prerequisites

* Install an {product-title} cluster and the `oc` command line.
* Log in to  `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. View the compute machine sets that are in the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
The compute machine sets are listed in the form of `<clusterid>-worker-<aws-region-az>`.

. View the compute machines that are in the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machine -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Set the annotation on the compute machine that you want to delete by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate machine/<machine_name> -n openshift-machine-api machine.openshift.io/delete-machine="true"
----

. Scale the compute machine set by running one of the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to scale the compute machine set:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata:
  name: <machineset>
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
  replicas: 2
----
====
+
You can scale the compute machine set up or down. It takes several minutes for the new machines to be available.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, the machine controller tries to drain the node that is backed by the machine until it succeeds. In some situations, such as with a misconfigured pod disruption budget, the drain operation might not be able to succeed. If the drain operation fails, the machine controller cannot proceed removing the machine.

You can skip draining the node by annotating `machine.openshift.io/exclude-node-draining` in a specific machine.
====

.Verification

* Verify the deletion of the intended machine by running the following command:
+

= Understanding the difference between compute machine sets and the machine config pool

`MachineSet` objects describe {product-title} nodes with respect to the cloud or machine provider.

The `MachineConfigPool` object allows `MachineConfigController` components to define and provide the status of machines in the context of upgrades.

The `MachineConfigPool` object allows users to configure how upgrades are rolled out to the {product-title} nodes in the machine config pool.

The `NodeSelector` object can be replaced with a reference to the `MachineSet` object.

[id="recommended-node-host-practices_{context}"]
= Recommended node host practices

The {product-title} node configuration file contains important options. For
example, two parameters control the maximum number of pods that can be scheduled
to a node: `podsPerCore` and `maxPods`.

When both options are in use, the lower of the two values limits the number of
pods on a node. Exceeding these values can result in:

* Increased CPU utilization.
* Slow pod scheduling.
* Potential out-of-memory scenarios, depending on the amount of memory in the node.
* Exhausting the pool of IP addresses.
* Resource overcommitting, leading to poor user application performance.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In Kubernetes, a pod that is holding a single container actually uses two
containers. The second container is used to set up networking prior to the
actual container starting. Therefore, a system running 10 pods will actually
have 20 containers running.

Disk IOPS throttling from the cloud provider might have an impact on CRI-O and kubelet.
They might get overloaded when there are large number of I/O intensive pods running on
the nodes. It is recommended that you monitor the disk I/O on the nodes and use volumes
with sufficient throughput for the workload.
====

`podsPerCore` sets the number of pods the node can run based on the number of
processor cores on the node. For example, if `podsPerCore` is set to `10` on a
node with 4 processor cores, the maximum number of pods allowed on the node will
be `40`.

[source,yaml]
----
kubeletConfig:
  podsPerCore: 10
----

Setting `podsPerCore` to `0` disables this limit. The default is `0`.
`podsPerCore` cannot exceed `maxPods`.

`maxPods` sets the number of pods the node can run to a fixed value, regardless
of the properties of the node.

    maxPods: 250

[id="create-a-kubeletconfig-crd-to-edit-kubelet-parameters_{context}"]
= Creating a KubeletConfig CRD to edit kubelet parameters

The kubelet configuration is currently serialized as an Ignition configuration, so it can be directly edited. However, there is also a new `kubelet-config-controller` added to the Machine Config Controller (MCC). This lets you use a `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) to edit the kubelet parameters.

[NOTE]
====
As the fields in the `kubeletConfig` object are passed directly to the kubelet from upstream Kubernetes, the kubelet validates those values directly. Invalid values in the `kubeletConfig` object might cause cluster nodes to become unavailable. For valid values, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1/[Kubernetes documentation].
====

Consider the following guidance:

* Create one `KubeletConfig` CR for each machine config pool with all the config changes you want for that pool. If you are applying the same content to all of the pools, you need only one `KubeletConfig` CR for all of the pools.

* Edit an existing `KubeletConfig` CR to modify existing settings or add new settings, instead of creating a CR for each change. It is recommended that you create a CR only to modify a different machine config pool, or for changes that are intended to be temporary, so that you can revert the changes.

* As needed, create multiple `KubeletConfig` CRs with a limit of 10 per cluster. For the first `KubeletConfig` CR, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) creates a machine config appended with `kubelet`. With each subsequent CR, the controller creates another `kubelet` machine config with a numeric suffix. For example, if you have a `kubelet` machine config with a `-2` suffix, the next `kubelet` machine config is appended with `-3`.

If you want to delete the machine configs, delete them in reverse order to avoid exceeding the limit. For example, you delete the `kubelet-3` machine config before deleting the `kubelet-2` machine config.

[NOTE]
====
If you have a machine config with a `kubelet-9` suffix, and you create another `KubeletConfig` CR, a new machine config is not created, even if there are fewer than 10 `kubelet` machine configs.
====

The following procedure is an example to show how to configure the maximum number of pods per node on the worker nodes.

.Prerequisites

. Obtain the label associated with the static `MachineConfigPool` CR for the type of node you want to configure.
Perform one of the following steps:

.. View the machine config pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe machineconfigpool <name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe machineconfigpool worker
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2019-02-08T14:52:39Z
  generation: 1
  labels:
    custom-kubelet: set-max-pods <1>
----
<1> If a label has been added it appears under `labels`.

.. If the label is not present, add a key/value pair:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label machineconfigpool worker custom-kubelet=set-max-pods
----

.Procedure

. View the available machine configuration objects that you can select:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfig
----
+
By default, the two kubelet-related configs are `01-master-kubelet` and `01-worker-kubelet`.

. Check the current value for the maximum pods per node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node <node_name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node ci-ln-5grqprb-f76d1-ncnqq-worker-a-mdv94
----
+
Look for `value: pods: <value>` in the `Allocatable` stanza:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Allocatable:
 attachable-volumes-aws-ebs:  25
 cpu:                         3500m
 hugepages-1Gi:               0
 hugepages-2Mi:               0
 memory:                      15341844Ki
 pods:                        250
----

. Set the maximum pods per node on the worker nodes by creating a custom resource file that contains the kubelet configuration:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Kubelet configurations that target a specific machine config pool also affect any dependent pools. For example, creating a kubelet configuration for the pool containing worker nodes will also apply to any subset pools, including the pool containing infrastructure nodes. To avoid this, you must create a new machine config pool with a selection expression that only includes worker nodes, and have your kubelet configuration target this new pool.
====
+
[source,yaml]

    maxPods: 500 <2>
----
<1> Enter the label from the machine config pool.
<2> Add the kubelet configuration. In this example, use `maxPods` to set the maximum pods per node.
+
[NOTE]
====
The rate at which the kubelet talks to the API server depends on queries per second (QPS) and burst values. The default values, `50` for `kubeAPIQPS` and `100` for `kubeAPIBurst`, are sufficient if there are limited pods running on each node. It is recommended to update the kubelet QPS and burst rates if there are enough CPU and memory resources on the node.

  kubeletConfig:
    maxPods: <pod_count>
    kubeAPIBurst: <burst_rate>
    kubeAPIQPS: <QPS>
----
====
.. Update the machine config pool for workers with the label:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label machineconfigpool worker custom-kubelet=set-max-pods
----

.. Create the `KubeletConfig` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f change-maxPods-cr.yaml
----

.. Verify that the `KubeletConfig` object is created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get kubeletconfig
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                AGE
set-max-pods        15m
----
+
Depending on the number of worker nodes in the cluster, wait for the worker nodes to be rebooted one by one. For a cluster with 3 worker nodes, this could take about 10 to 15 minutes.

. Verify that the changes are applied to the node:

.. Check on a worker node that the `maxPods` value changed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node <node_name>
----

.. Locate the `Allocatable` stanza:
+
[source,terminal]
----

  cpu:                        3500m

  hugepages-2Mi:              0
  memory:                     14225400Ki
  pods:                       500 <1>
 ...
----
<1> In this example, the `pods` parameter should report the value you set in the `KubeletConfig` object.

. Verify the change in the `KubeletConfig` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get kubeletconfigs set-max-pods -o yaml
----
+
This should show a status of `True` and `type:Success`, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:

    maxPods: 500
  machineConfigPoolSelector:

= Modifying the number of unavailable worker nodes

By default, only one machine is allowed to be unavailable when applying the kubelet-related configuration to the available worker nodes. For a large cluster, it can take a long time for the configuration change to be reflected. At any time, you can adjust the number of machines that are updating to speed up the process.

.Procedure

. Edit the `worker` machine config pool:

[IMPORTANT]
====
When setting the value, consider the number of worker nodes that can be
unavailable without affecting the applications running on the cluster.

=  Control plane node sizing

The control plane node resource requirements depend on the number and type of nodes and objects in the cluster. The following control plane node size recommendations are based on the results of a control plane density focused testing, or _Cluster-density_. This test creates the following objects across a given number of namespaces:

- 1 image stream
- 1 build
- 5 deployments, with 2 pod replicas in a `sleep` state, mounting 4 secrets, 4 config maps, and 1 downward API volume each
- 5 services, each one pointing to the TCP/8080 and TCP/8443 ports of one of the previous deployments
- 1 route pointing to the first of the previous services
- 10 secrets containing 2048 random string characters
- 10 config maps containing 2048 random string characters

|===

The data from the table above is based on an {product-title} running on top of AWS, using r5.4xlarge instances as control-plane nodes and m5.2xlarge instances as worker nodes.

On a large and dense cluster with three control plane nodes, the CPU and memory usage will spike up when one of the nodes is stopped, rebooted, or fails. The failures can be due to unexpected issues with power, network, underlying infrastructure, or intentional cases where the cluster is restarted after shutting it down to save costs. The remaining two control plane nodes must handle the load in order to be highly available, which leads to increase in the resource usage. This is also expected during upgrades because the control plane nodes are cordoned, drained, and rebooted serially to apply the operating system updates, as well as the control plane Operators update. To avoid cascading failures, keep the overall CPU and memory resource usage on the control plane nodes to at most 60% of all available capacity to handle the resource usage spikes. Increase the CPU and memory on the control plane nodes accordingly to avoid potential downtime due to lack of resources.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The node sizing varies depending on the number of nodes and object counts in the cluster. It also depends on whether the objects are actively being created on the cluster. During object creation, the control plane is more active in terms of resource usage compared to when the objects are in the `running` phase.
====

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM ) runs on the control plane nodes and its memory footprint depends on the number of namespaces and user installed operators that OLM needs to manage on the cluster. Control plane nodes need to be sized accordingly to avoid OOM kills. Following data points are based on the results from cluster maximums testing.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can modify the control plane node size in a running {product-title} {product-version} cluster for the following configurations only:

* Clusters installed with a user-provisioned installation method.
* AWS clusters installed with an installer-provisioned infrastructure installation method.
* Clusters that use a control plane machine set to manage control plane machines.

For all other configurations, you must estimate your total node count and use the suggested control plane node size during installation.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The recommendations are based on the data points captured on {product-title} clusters with OpenShift SDN as the network plugin.
====

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} {product-version}, half of a CPU core (500 millicore) is now reserved by the system by default compared to {product-title} 3.11 and previous versions. The sizes are determined taking that into consideration.

= Setting up CPU Manager

.Procedure

. Optional: Label a node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc label node perf-node.example.com cpumanager=true
----

. Edit the `MachineConfigPool` of the nodes where CPU Manager should be enabled. In this example, all workers have CPU Manager enabled:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc edit machineconfigpool worker
----

. Add a label to the worker machine config pool:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2020-xx-xxx
  generation: 3
  labels:
    custom-kubelet: cpumanager-enabled
----

. Create a `KubeletConfig`, `cpumanager-kubeletconfig.yaml`, custom resource (CR). Refer to the label created in the previous step to have the correct nodes updated with the new kubelet config. See the `machineConfigPoolSelector` section:

  kubeletConfig:
     cpuManagerPolicy: static <1>
     cpuManagerReconcilePeriod: 5s <2>
----
<1> Specify a policy:
* `none`. This policy explicitly enables the existing default CPU affinity scheme, providing no affinity beyond what the scheduler does automatically. This is the default policy.
* `static`. This policy allows containers in guaranteed pods with integer CPU requests. It also limits access to exclusive CPUs on the node. If `static`, you must use a lowercase `s`.
<2> Optional. Specify the CPU Manager reconcile frequency. The default is `5s`.

. Create the dynamic kubelet config:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc create -f cpumanager-kubeletconfig.yaml
----
+
This adds the CPU Manager feature to the kubelet config and, if needed, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) reboots the node. To enable CPU Manager, a reboot is not needed.

. Check for the merged kubelet config:

You can see that `Allocatable CPU` is 1500 millicores. This means you can run one of the CPU Manager pods since each will take one whole core. A whole core is equivalent to 1000 millicores. If you try to schedule a second pod, the system will accept the pod, but it will never be scheduled:

= What huge pages do

Memory is managed in blocks known as pages. On most systems, a page is 4Ki. 1Mi
of memory is equal to 256 pages; 1Gi of memory is 256,000 pages, and so on. CPUs
have a built-in memory management unit that manages a list of these pages in
hardware. The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is a small hardware cache of
virtual-to-physical page mappings. If the virtual address passed in a hardware
instruction can be found in the TLB, the mapping can be determined quickly. If
not, a TLB miss occurs, and the system falls back to slower, software-based
address translation, resulting in performance issues. Since the size of the TLB
is fixed, the only way to reduce the chance of a TLB miss is to increase the
page size.

A huge page is a memory page that is larger than 4Ki. On x86_64 architectures,
there are two common huge page sizes: 2Mi and 1Gi. Sizes vary on other
architectures. To use huge pages, code must be written so that
applications are aware of them. Transparent Huge Pages (THP) attempt to automate
the management of huge pages without application knowledge, but they have
limitations. In particular, they are limited to 2Mi page sizes. THP can lead to
performance degradation on nodes with high memory utilization or fragmentation
due to defragmenting efforts of THP, which can lock memory pages. For this
reason, some applications may be designed to (or recommend) usage of
pre-allocated huge pages instead of THP.

[id="how-huge-pages-are-consumed-by-apps_{context}"]
= How huge pages are consumed by apps

Nodes must pre-allocate huge pages in order for the node to report its huge page
capacity. A node can only pre-allocate huge pages for a single size.

Huge pages can be consumed through container-level resource requirements using the
resource name `hugepages-<size>`, where size is the most compact binary
notation using integer values supported on a particular node. For example, if a
node supports 2048KiB page sizes, it exposes a schedulable resource
`hugepages-2Mi`. Unlike CPU or memory, huge pages do not support over-commitment.

<1> Specify the amount of memory for `hugepages` as the exact amount to be
allocated. Do not specify this value as the amount of memory for `hugepages`
multiplied by the size of the page. For example, given a huge page size of 2MB,
if you want to use 100MB of huge-page-backed RAM for your application, then you
would allocate 50 huge pages. {product-title} handles the math for you. As in
the above example, you can specify `100MB` directly.

*Allocating huge pages of a specific size*

Some platforms support multiple huge page sizes. To allocate huge pages of a
specific size, precede the huge pages boot command parameters with a huge page
size selection parameter `hugepagesz=<size>`. The `<size>` value must be
specified in bytes with an optional scale suffix [`kKmMgG`]. The default huge
page size can be defined with the `default_hugepagesz=<size>` boot parameter.

*Huge page requirements*

* Huge page requests must equal the limits. This is the default if limits are
specified, but requests are not.

* Huge pages are isolated at a pod scope. Container isolation is planned in a
future iteration.

* `EmptyDir` volumes backed by huge pages must not consume more huge page memory
than the pod request.

* Applications that consume huge pages via `shmget()` with `SHM_HUGETLB` must run
with a supplemental group that matches *_proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group_*.

= Configuring huge pages at boot time

Nodes must pre-allocate huge pages used in an {product-title} cluster. There are two ways of reserving huge pages: at boot time and at run time. Reserving at boot time increases the possibility of success because the memory has not yet been significantly fragmented. The Node Tuning Operator currently supports boot time allocation of huge pages on specific nodes.

.Procedure

To minimize node reboots, the order of the steps below needs to be followed:

. Label all nodes that need the same huge pages setting by a label.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node_using_hugepages> node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-hp=
----

. Create a file with the following content and name it `hugepages-tuned-boottime.yaml`:
+

  recommend:
  - machineConfigLabels: <4>
      machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: "worker-hp"
    priority: 30
    profile: openshift-node-hugepages
----
<1> Set the `name` of the Tuned resource to `hugepages`.
<2> Set the `profile` section to allocate huge pages.
<3> Note the order of parameters is important as some platforms support huge pages of various sizes.
<4> Enable machine config pool based matching.

. Create the Tuned `hugepages` object
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f hugepages-tuned-boottime.yaml
----

. Create a file with the following content and name it `hugepages-mcp.yaml`:

----

. Create the machine config pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f hugepages-mcp.yaml
----

Given enough non-fragmented memory, all the nodes in the `worker-hp` machine config pool should now have 50 2Mi huge pages allocated.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get node <node_using_hugepages> -o jsonpath="{.status.allocatable.hugepages-2Mi}"

The TuneD bootloader plugin only supports {op-system-first} worker nodes.
====

////
For run-time allocation, kubelet changes are needed, see BZ1819719.
== At run time

.Procedure

. Label the node so that the Node Tuning Operator knows on which node to apply the tuned profile, which describes how many huge pages should be allocated:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node_using_hugepages> hugepages=true
----

----
<1> Set the `name` of the Tuned resource to `hugepages`.
<2> Set the `profile` section to allocate huge pages.
<3> Set the `match` section to associate the profile to nodes with the `hugepages` label.

. Create the custom `hugepages` tuned profile by using the `hugepages-tuned-runtime.yaml` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f hugepages-tuned-runtime.yaml
----

. After creating the profile, the Operator applies the new profile to the correct
node and allocates huge pages. Check the logs of a tuned pod on a node using
huge pages to verify:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs <tuned_pod_on_node_using_hugepages> \

= Understanding device plugins

The device plugin provides a consistent and portable solution to consume hardware
devices across clusters. The device plugin provides support for these devices
through an extension mechanism, which makes these devices available to
Containers, provides health checks of these devices, and securely shares them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} supports the device plugin API, but the device plugin
Containers are supported by individual vendors.
====

A device plugin is a gRPC service running on the nodes (external to
the `kubelet`) that is responsible for managing specific
hardware resources. Any device plugin must support following remote procedure
calls (RPCs):

[source,golang]
----
service DevicePlugin {
      // GetDevicePluginOptions returns options to be communicated with Device
      // Manager
      rpc GetDevicePluginOptions(Empty) returns (DevicePluginOptions) {}

      // ListAndWatch returns a stream of List of Devices
      // Whenever a Device state change or a Device disappears, ListAndWatch
      // returns the new list
      rpc ListAndWatch(Empty) returns (stream ListAndWatchResponse) {}

      // Allocate is called during container creation so that the Device
      // Plug-in can run device specific operations and instruct Kubelet
      // of the steps to make the Device available in the container
      rpc Allocate(AllocateRequest) returns (AllocateResponse) {}

      // PreStartcontainer is called, if indicated by Device Plug-in during
      // registration phase, before each container start. Device plug-in
      // can run device specific operations such as resetting the device
      // before making devices available to the container
      rpc PreStartcontainer(PreStartcontainerRequest) returns (PreStartcontainerResponse) {}
}

====

[id="methods-for-deploying-a-device-plugin_{context}"]
== Methods for deploying a device plugin

* Daemon sets are the recommended approach for device plugin deployments.
* Upon start, the device plugin will try to create a UNIX domain socket at
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugin/_* on the node to serve RPCs from Device Manager.
* Since device plugins must manage hardware resources, access to the host
file system, as well as socket creation, they must be run in a privileged
security context.
* More specific details regarding deployment steps can be found with each device
plugin implementation.

[id="nodes-pods-plugins-device-mgr_{context}"]
= Understanding the Device Manager

Device Manager provides a mechanism for advertising specialized node hardware resources
with the help of plugins known as device plugins.

You can advertise specialized hardware without requiring any upstream code changes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} supports the device plugin API, but the device plugin
Containers are supported by individual vendors.
====

Device Manager advertises devices as *Extended Resources*. User pods can consume
devices, advertised by Device Manager, using the same *Limit/Request* mechanism,
which is used for requesting any other *Extended Resource*.

Upon start, the device plugin registers itself with Device Manager invoking `Register` on the
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/kubelet.sock_* and starts a gRPC service at
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/<plugin>.sock_* for serving Device Manager
requests.

Device Manager, while processing a new registration request, invokes
`ListAndWatch` remote procedure call (RPC) at the device plugin service. In
response, Device Manager gets a list of *Device* objects from the plugin over a
gRPC stream. Device Manager will keep watching on the stream for new updates
from the plugin. On the plugin side, the plugin will also keep the stream
open and whenever there is a change in the state of any of the devices, a new
device list is sent to the Device Manager over the same streaming connection.

While handling a new pod admission request, Kubelet passes requested `Extended
Resources` to the Device Manager for device allocation. Device Manager checks in
its database to verify if a corresponding plugin exists or not. If the plugin exists
and there are free allocatable devices as well as per local cache, `Allocate`
RPC is invoked at that particular device plugin.

Additionally, device plugins can also perform several other device-specific
operations, such as driver installation, device initialization, and device
resets. These functionalities vary from implementation to implementation.

A _taint_ allows a node to refuse a pod to be scheduled unless that pod has a matching _toleration_.

You apply taints to a node through the `Node` specification (`NodeSpec`) and apply tolerations to a pod through the `Pod` specification (`PodSpec`). When you apply a taint a node, the scheduler cannot place a pod on that node unless the pod can tolerate the taint.

= Adding taints and tolerations

You add tolerations to pods and taints to nodes to allow the node to control which pods should or should not be scheduled on them. For existing pods and nodes, you should add the toleration to the pod first, then add the taint to the node to avoid pods being removed from the node before you can add the toleration.

.Procedure

. Add a toleration to a pod by editing the `Pod` spec to include a `tolerations` stanza:

[id="topology_manager_policies_{context}"]
= Topology Manager policies

Topology Manager aligns `Pod` resources of all Quality of Service (QoS) classes by collecting topology hints from Hint Providers, such as CPU Manager and Device Manager, and using the collected hints to align the `Pod` resources.

Topology Manager supports four allocation policies, which you assign in the `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) named `cpumanager-enabled`:

`none` policy::

This is the default policy and does not perform any topology alignment.

`best-effort` policy::

For each container in a pod with the `best-effort` topology management policy, kubelet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource
availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager stores the preferred NUMA Node affinity for that container. If the affinity is not preferred, Topology Manager stores this and admits the pod to the node.

`restricted` policy::

For each container in a pod with the `restricted` topology management policy, kubelet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource
availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager stores the preferred NUMA Node affinity for that container. If the affinity is not
preferred, Topology Manager rejects this pod from the node, resulting in a pod in a `Terminated` state with a pod admission failure.

`single-numa-node` policy::

For each container in a pod with the `single-numa-node` topology management policy, kubelet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager determines if a single NUMA Node affinity is possible. If it is, the pod is admitted to the node. If a single NUMA Node affinity is not possible, the Topology Manager rejects the pod from the node. This results in a pod in a Terminated state with a pod admission failure.

[id="pod-interactions-with-topology-manager_{context}"]
= Pod interactions with Topology Manager policies

The example `Pod` specs below help illustrate pod interactions with Topology Manager.

The following pod runs in the `BestEffort` QoS class because no resource requests or limits are specified.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
----

The next pod runs in the `Burstable` QoS class because requests are less than limits.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
      requests:
        memory: "100Mi"
----

If the selected policy is anything other than `none`, Topology Manager would not consider either of these `Pod` specifications.

The last example pod below runs in the Guaranteed QoS class because requests are equal to limits.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
        example.com/device: "1"
      requests:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
        example.com/device: "1"
----

Topology Manager would consider this pod. The Topology Manager would consult the hint providers, which are CPU Manager and Device Manager, to get topology hints for the pod.

Topology Manager will use this information to store the best topology for this container. In the case of this pod, CPU Manager and Device Manager will use this stored information at the resource allocation stage.

[id="nodes-cluster-overcommit-resource-requests_{context}"]
= Resource requests and overcommitment

For each compute resource, a container may specify a resource request and limit.
Scheduling decisions are made based on the request to ensure that a node has
enough capacity available to meet the requested value. If a container specifies
limits, but omits requests, the requests are defaulted to the limits. A
container is not able to exceed the specified limit on the node.

The enforcement of limits is dependent upon the compute resource type. If a
container makes no request or limit, the container is scheduled to a node with
no resource guarantees. In practice, the container is able to consume as much of
the specified resource as is available with the lowest local priority. In low
resource situations, containers that specify no resource requests are given the
lowest quality of service.

Scheduling is based on resources requested, while quota and hard limits refer
to resource limits, which can be set higher than requested resources. The
difference between request and limit determines the level of overcommit;
for instance, if a container is given a memory request of 1Gi and a memory limit
of 2Gi, it is scheduled based on the 1Gi request being available on the node,
but could use up to 2Gi; so it is 200% overcommitted.

[id="nodes-cluster-resource-override_{context}"]
= Cluster-level overcommit using the Cluster Resource Override Operator

The Cluster Resource Override Operator is an admission webhook that allows you to control the level of overcommit and manage
container density across all the nodes in your cluster. The Operator controls how nodes in specific projects can exceed defined memory and CPU limits.

You must install the Cluster Resource Override Operator using the {product-title} console or CLI as shown in the following sections.
During the installation, you create a `ClusterResourceOverride` custom resource (CR), where you set the level of overcommit, as shown in the
following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.autoscaling.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterResourceOverride
metadata:
    name: cluster <1>
spec:
  podResourceOverride:
    spec:
      memoryRequestToLimitPercent: 50 <2>
      cpuRequestToLimitPercent: 25 <3>
      limitCPUToMemoryPercent: 200 <4>
# ...
----
<1> The name must be `cluster`.
<2> Optional. If a container memory limit has been specified or defaulted, the memory request is overridden to this percentage of the limit, between 1-100. The default is 50.
<3> Optional. If a container CPU limit has been specified or defaulted, the CPU request is overridden to this percentage of the limit, between 1-100. The default is 25.
<4> Optional. If a container memory limit has been specified or defaulted, the CPU limit is overridden to a percentage of the memory limit, if specified. Scaling 1Gi of RAM at 100 percent is equal to 1 CPU core. This is processed prior to overriding the CPU request (if configured). The default is 200.

[NOTE]
====
The Cluster Resource Override Operator overrides have no effect if limits have not
been set on containers. Create a `LimitRange` object with default limits per individual project
or configure limits in `Pod` specs for the overrides to apply.
====

When configured, overrides can be enabled per-project by applying the following
label to the Namespace object for each project:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:

# ...

  labels:
    clusterresourceoverrides.admission.autoscaling.openshift.io/enabled: "true"

# ...
----

The Operator watches for the `ClusterResourceOverride` CR and ensures that the `ClusterResourceOverride` admission webhook is installed into the same namespace as the operator.

= Configuring cluster-level overcommit


The Cluster Resource Override Operator requires a `ClusterResourceOverride` custom resource (CR)
and a label for each project where you want the Operator to control overcommit.

.Prerequisites

* The Cluster Resource Override Operator has no effect if limits have not
been set on containers. You must specify default limits for a project using a `LimitRange` object or configure limits in `Pod` specs for the overrides to apply.

.Procedure

To modify cluster-level overcommit:

. Edit the `ClusterResourceOverride` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.autoscaling.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterResourceOverride
metadata:
    name: cluster
spec:
  podResourceOverride:
    spec:
      memoryRequestToLimitPercent: 50 <1>
      cpuRequestToLimitPercent: 25 <2>
      limitCPUToMemoryPercent: 200 <3>
# ...
----
<1> Optional. Specify the percentage to override the container memory limit, if used, between 1-100. The default is 50.
<2> Optional. Specify the percentage to override the container CPU limit, if used, between 1-100. The default is 25.
<3> Optional. Specify the percentage to override the container memory limit, if used. Scaling 1Gi of RAM at 100 percent is equal to 1 CPU core. This is processed prior to overriding the CPU request, if configured. The default is 200.

. Ensure the following label has been added to the Namespace object for each project where you want the Cluster Resource Override Operator to control overcommit:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:

# ...

  labels:
    clusterresourceoverrides.admission.autoscaling.openshift.io/enabled: "true" <1>

= Understanding compute resources and containers
The node-enforced behavior for compute resources is specific to the resource
type.

[id="understanding-container-CPU-requests_{context}"]
== Understanding container CPU requests

A container is guaranteed the amount of CPU it requests and is additionally able
to consume excess CPU available on the node, up to any limit specified by the
container. If multiple containers are attempting to use excess CPU, CPU time is
distributed based on the amount of CPU requested by each container.

For example, if one container requested 500m of CPU time and another container
requested 250m of CPU time, then any extra CPU time available on the node is
distributed among the containers in a 2:1 ratio. If a container specified a
limit, it will be throttled not to use more CPU than the specified limit.
CPU requests are enforced using the CFS shares support in the Linux kernel. By
default, CPU limits are enforced using the CFS quota support in the Linux kernel
over a 100ms measuring interval, though this can be disabled.

[id="understanding-memory-requests-container_{context}"]
== Understanding container memory requests

A container is guaranteed the amount of memory it requests. A container can use
more memory than requested, but once it exceeds its requested amount, it could
be terminated in a low memory situation on the node.
If a container uses less memory than requested, it will not be terminated unless
system tasks or daemons need more memory than was accounted for in the node's
resource reservation. If a container specifies a limit on memory, it is
immediately terminated if it exceeds the limit amount.

The {product-title} cluster uses ephemeral storage to store information that does not have to persist after the cluster is destroyed.
====

A container is guaranteed the amount of ephemeral storage it requests. A
container can use more ephemeral storage than requested, but once it exceeds its
requested amount, it can be terminated if the available ephemeral disk space gets
too low.

If a container uses less ephemeral storage than requested, it will not be
terminated unless system tasks or daemons need more local ephemeral storage than
was accounted for in the node's resource reservation. If a container specifies a
limit on ephemeral storage, it is immediately terminated if it exceeds the limit
amount.

[id="nodes-cluster-overcommit-qos-about_{context}"]
= Understanding overcomitment and quality of service classes

A node is _overcommitted_ when it has a pod scheduled that makes no request, or
when the sum of limits across all pods on that node exceeds available machine
capacity.

In an overcommitted environment, it is possible that the pods on the node will
attempt to use more compute resource than is available at any given point in
time. When this occurs, the node must give priority to one pod over another. The
facility used to make this decision is referred to as a Quality of Service (QoS)
Class.

A pod is designated as one of three QoS classes with decreasing order of priority:

.Quality of Service Classes
[options="header",cols="1,1,5"]
|===
|Priority |Class Name |Description

|1 (highest)
|*Guaranteed*
|If limits and optionally requests are set (not equal to 0) for all resources
and they are equal, then the pod is classified as *Guaranteed*.

|2
|*Burstable*
|If requests and optionally limits are set (not equal to 0) for all resources,
and they are not equal, then the pod is classified as *Burstable*.

|3 (lowest)
|*BestEffort*
|If requests and limits are not set for any of the resources, then the pod
is classified as *BestEffort*.
|===

Memory is an incompressible resource, so in low memory situations, containers
that have the lowest priority are terminated first:

- *Guaranteed* containers are considered top priority, and are guaranteed to
only be terminated if they exceed their limits, or if the system is under memory
pressure and there are no lower priority containers that can be evicted.
- *Burstable* containers under system memory pressure are more likely to be
terminated once they exceed their requests and no other *BestEffort* containers
exist.
- *BestEffort* containers are treated with the lowest priority. Processes in
these containers are first to be terminated if the system runs out of memory.

[id="qos-about-reserve_{context}"]
== Understanding how to reserve memory across quality of service tiers

You can use the `qos-reserved` parameter to specify a percentage of memory to be reserved
by a pod in a particular QoS level. This feature attempts to reserve requested resources to exclude pods
from lower OoS classes from using resources requested by pods in higher QoS classes.

{product-title} uses the `qos-reserved` parameter as follows:

- A value of `qos-reserved=memory=100%` will prevent the `Burstable` and `BestEffort` QoS classes from consuming memory
that was requested by a higher QoS class. This increases the risk of inducing OOM
on `BestEffort` and `Burstable` workloads in favor of increasing memory resource guarantees
for `Guaranteed` and `Burstable` workloads.

- A value of `qos-reserved=memory=50%` will allow the `Burstable` and `BestEffort` QoS classes
to consume half of the memory requested by a higher QoS class.

- A value of `qos-reserved=memory=0%`
will allow a `Burstable` and `BestEffort` QoS classes to consume up to the full node
allocatable amount if available, but increases the risk that a `Guaranteed` workload
will not have access to requested memory. This condition effectively disables this feature.

[id="nodes-qos-about-swap_{context}"]
= Understanding swap memory and QOS

You can disable swap by default on your nodes to preserve quality of
service (QOS) guarantees. Otherwise, physical resources on a node can oversubscribe,
affecting the resource guarantees the Kubernetes scheduler makes during pod
placement.

For example, if two guaranteed pods have reached their memory limit, each
container could start using swap memory. Eventually, if there is not enough swap
space, processes in the pods can be terminated due to the system being
oversubscribed.

Failing to disable swap results in nodes not recognizing that they are
experiencing *MemoryPressure*, resulting in pods not receiving the memory they
made in their scheduling request. As a result, additional pods are placed on the
node to further increase memory pressure, ultimately increasing your risk of
experiencing a system out of memory (OOM) event.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If swap is enabled, any out-of-resource handling eviction thresholds for available memory will not work as
expected. Take advantage of out-of-resource handling to allow pods to be evicted
from a node when it is under memory pressure, and rescheduled on an alternative
node that has no such pressure.

[id="nodes-cluster-overcommit-configure-nodes_{context}"]
= Understanding nodes overcommitment

In an overcommitted environment, it is important to properly configure your node to provide best system behavior.

When the node starts, it ensures that the kernel tunable flags for memory
management are set properly. The kernel should never fail memory allocations
unless it runs out of physical memory.

To ensure this behavior, {product-title} configures the kernel to always overcommit
memory by setting the `vm.overcommit_memory` parameter to `1`, overriding the
default operating system setting.

{product-title} also configures the kernel not to panic when it runs out of memory
by setting the `vm.panic_on_oom` parameter to `0`. A setting of 0 instructs the
kernel to call oom_killer in an Out of Memory (OOM) condition, which kills
processes based on priority

You can view the current setting by running the following commands on your nodes:

[source,terminal]
----
$ sysctl -a |grep commit
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
#...
vm.overcommit_memory = 0
#...
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ sysctl -a |grep panic
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
#...
vm.panic_on_oom = 0
#...
----

[NOTE]
====
The above flags should already be set on nodes, and no further action is
required.
====

You can also perform the following configurations for each node:

* Disable or enforce CPU limits using CPU CFS quotas

* Reserve resources for system processes

* Reserve memory across quality of service tiers

[id="nodes-cluster-overcommit-node-enforcing_{context}"]

= Disabling or enforcing CPU limits using CPU CFS quotas

Nodes by default enforce specified CPU limits using the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) quota support in the Linux kernel.

If you disable CPU limit enforcement, it is important to understand the impact on your node:

* If a container has a CPU request, the request continues to be enforced by CFS shares in the Linux kernel.
* If a container does not have a CPU request, but does have a CPU limit, the CPU request defaults to the specified CPU limit, and is enforced by CFS shares in the Linux kernel.
* If a container has both a CPU request and limit, the CPU request is enforced by CFS shares in the Linux kernel, and the CPU limit has no impact on the node.

= Reserving resources for system processes

To provide more reliable scheduling and minimize node resource overcommitment,
each node can reserve a portion of its resources for use by system daemons
that are required to run on your node for your cluster to function.
In particular, it is recommended that you reserve resources for incompressible resources such as memory.

.Procedure

To explicitly reserve resources for non-pod processes, allocate node resources by specifying resources
available for scheduling.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="nodes-nodes-garbage-collection-containers_{context}"]
= Understanding how terminated containers are removed through garbage collection

Container garbage collection removes terminated containers by using eviction thresholds.

When eviction thresholds are set for garbage collection, the node tries to keep any container for any pod accessible from the API. If the pod has been deleted, the containers will be as well. Containers are preserved as long the pod is not deleted and the eviction threshold is not reached. If the node is under disk pressure, it will remove containers and their logs will no longer be accessible using `oc logs`.

* *eviction-soft* - A soft eviction threshold pairs an eviction threshold with a required administrator-specified grace period.

* *eviction-hard* - A hard eviction threshold has no grace period, and if observed, {product-title} takes immediate action.

The following table lists the eviction thresholds:

.Variables for configuring container garbage collection
|===
| Node condition | Eviction signal | Description

| MemoryPressure
| `memory.available`
| The available memory on the node.

| DiskPressure
a| * `nodefs.available`
  * `nodefs.inodesFree`
  * `imagefs.available`
  * `imagefs.inodesFree`
| The available disk space or inodes on the node root file system, `nodefs`, or image file system, `imagefs`.
|===

[NOTE]
====
For `evictionHard` you must specify all of these parameters.  If you do not specify all parameters, only the specified parameters are applied and the garbage collection will not function properly.
====

If a node is oscillating above and below a soft eviction threshold, but not exceeding its associated grace period, the corresponding node would constantly oscillate between `true` and `false`. As a consequence, the scheduler could make poor scheduling decisions.

To protect against this oscillation, use the `eviction-pressure-transition-period` flag to control how long {product-title} must wait before transitioning out of a pressure condition. {product-title} will not set an eviction threshold as being met for the specified pressure condition for the period specified before toggling the condition back to false.

[id="nodes-nodes-garbage-collection-images_{context}"]
= Understanding how images are removed through garbage collection

Image garbage collection removes images that are not referenced by any running pods.

{product-title} determines which images to remove from a node based on the disk usage that is reported by *cAdvisor*.

The policy for image garbage collection is based on two conditions:

* The percent of disk usage (expressed as an integer) which triggers image
garbage collection. The default is *85*.

* The percent of disk usage (expressed as an integer) to which image garbage
collection attempts to free. Default is *80*.

For image garbage collection, you can modify any of the following variables using
a custom resource.

.Variables for configuring image garbage collection

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===

|Setting |Description

|`imageMinimumGCAge`
|The minimum age for an unused image before the image is removed by garbage collection. The default is *2m*.

|`imageGCHighThresholdPercent`
|The percent of disk usage, expressed as an integer, which triggers image
garbage collection. The default is *85*.

|`imageGCLowThresholdPercent`
|The percent of disk usage, expressed as an integer, to which image garbage
collection attempts to free. The default is *80*.
|===

Two lists of images are retrieved in each garbage collector run:

1. A list of images currently running in at least one pod.
2. A list of images available on a host.

As new containers are run, new images appear. All images are marked with a time
stamp. If the image is running (the first list above) or is newly detected (the
second list above), it is marked with the current time. The remaining images are
already marked from the previous spins. All images are then sorted by the time
stamp.

Once the collection starts, the oldest images get deleted first until the
stopping criterion is met.

== Purpose


The Node Tuning Operator helps you manage node-level tuning by orchestrating the TuneD daemon and achieves low latency performance by using the Performance Profile controller. The majority of high-performance applications require some level of kernel tuning. The Node Tuning Operator provides a unified management interface to users of node-level sysctls and more flexibility to add custom tuning specified by user needs.


The Operator manages the containerized TuneD daemon for {product-title} as a Kubernetes daemon set. It ensures the custom tuning specification is passed to all containerized TuneD daemons running in the cluster in the format that the daemons understand. The daemons run on all nodes in the cluster, one per node.

Node-level settings applied by the containerized TuneD daemon are rolled back on an event that triggers a profile change or when the containerized TuneD daemon is terminated gracefully by receiving and handling a termination signal.

The Node Tuning Operator uses the Performance Profile controller to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for {product-title} applications.

The cluster administrator configures a performance profile to define node-level settings such as the following:

* Updating the kernel to kernel-rt.
* Choosing CPUs for housekeeping.
* Choosing CPUs for running workloads.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, disabling CPU load balancing is not supported by cgroup v2. As a result, you might not get the desired behavior from performance profiles if you have cgroup v2 enabled. Enabling cgroup v2 is not recommended if you are using performance profiles.
====

The Node Tuning Operator is part of a standard {product-title} installation in version 4.1 and later.

[NOTE]
====
In earlier versions of {product-title}, the Performance Addon Operator was used to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for OpenShift applications. In {product-title} 4.11 and later, this functionality is part of the Node Tuning Operator.

.Procedure

 * Run the following command to access an example Node Tuning Operator specification:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc get tuned.tuned.openshift.io/default -o yaml -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
----

The default CR is meant for delivering standard node-level tuning for the {product-title} platform and it can only be modified to set the Operator Management state. Any other custom changes to the default CR will be overwritten by the Operator. For custom tuning, create your own Tuned CRs. Newly created CRs will be combined with the default CR and custom tuning applied to {product-title} nodes based on node or pod labels and profile priorities.

[WARNING]
====
While in certain situations the support for pod labels can be a convenient way of automatically delivering required tuning, this practice is discouraged and strongly advised against, especially in large-scale clusters. The default Tuned CR ships without pod label matching. If a custom profile is created with pod label matching, then the functionality will be enabled at that time. The pod label functionality will be deprecated in future versions of the Node Tuning Operator.

[id="custom-tuning-specification_{context}"]
= Custom tuning specification

The custom resource (CR) for the Operator has two major sections. The first section, `profile:`, is a list of TuneD profiles and their names. The second, `recommend:`, defines the profile selection logic.

Multiple custom tuning specifications can co-exist as multiple CRs in the Operator's namespace. The existence of new CRs or the deletion of old CRs is detected by the Operator. All existing custom tuning specifications are merged and appropriate objects for the containerized TuneD daemons are updated.

*Management state*

The Operator Management state is set by adjusting the default Tuned CR. By default, the Operator is in the Managed state and the `spec.managementState` field is not present in the default Tuned CR. Valid values for the Operator Management state are as follows:

  * Managed: the Operator will update its operands as configuration resources are updated
  * Unmanaged: the Operator will ignore changes to the configuration resources
  * Removed: the Operator will remove its operands and resources the Operator provisioned

*Profile data*

The `profile:` section lists TuneD profiles and their names.

[source,yaml]
----

- name: tuned_profile_1

  data: |
    # TuneD profile specification
    [main]
    summary=Description of tuned_profile_n profile

    # tuned_profile_n profile settings

*Recommended profiles*

The `profile:` selection logic is defined by the `recommend:` section of the CR. The `recommend:` section is a list of items to recommend the profiles based on a selection criteria.

[source,yaml]
----
recommend:
<recommend-item-1>
# ...
<recommend-item-n>
----

The individual items of the list:

[source,yaml]
----
- machineConfigLabels: <1>
    <mcLabels> <2>
  match: <3>
    <match> <4>
  priority: <priority> <5>
  profile: <tuned_profile_name> <6>
  operand: <7>
    debug: <bool> <8>
    tunedConfig:
      reapply_sysctl: <bool> <9>
----
<1> Optional.
<2> A dictionary of key/value `MachineConfig` labels. The keys must be unique.
<3> If omitted, profile match is assumed unless a profile with a higher priority matches first or `machineConfigLabels` is set.
<4> An optional list.
<5> Profile ordering priority. Lower numbers mean higher priority (`0` is the highest priority).
<6> A TuneD profile to apply on a match. For example `tuned_profile_1`.
<7> Optional operand configuration.
<8> Turn debugging on or off for the TuneD daemon. Options are `true` for on or `false` for off. The default is `false`.
<9> Turn `reapply_sysctl` functionality on or off for the TuneD daemon. Options are `true` for on and `false` for off.

`<match>` is an optional list recursively defined as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
- label: <label_name> <1>
  value: <label_value> <2>
  type: <label_type> <3>
    <match> <4>
----
<1> Node or pod label name.
<2> Optional node or pod label value. If omitted, the presence of `<label_name>` is enough to match.
<3> Optional object type (`node` or `pod`). If omitted, `node` is assumed.
<4> An optional `<match>` list.

If `<match>` is not omitted, all nested `<match>` sections must also evaluate to `true`. Otherwise, `false` is assumed and the profile with the respective `<match>` section will not be applied or recommended. Therefore, the nesting (child `<match>` sections) works as logical AND operator. Conversely, if any item of the `<match>` list matches, the entire `<match>` list evaluates to `true`. Therefore, the list acts as logical OR operator.

If `machineConfigLabels` is defined, machine config pool based matching is turned on for the given `recommend:` list item. `<mcLabels>` specifies the labels for a machine config. The machine config is created automatically to apply host settings, such as kernel boot parameters, for the profile `<tuned_profile_name>`. This involves finding all machine config pools with machine config selector matching `<mcLabels>` and setting the profile `<tuned_profile_name>` on all nodes that are assigned the found machine config pools. To target nodes that have both master and worker roles, you must use the master role.

The list items `match` and `machineConfigLabels` are connected by the logical OR operator. The `match` item is evaluated first in a short-circuit manner. Therefore, if it evaluates to `true`, the `machineConfigLabels` item is not considered.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using machine config pool based matching, it is advised to group nodes with the same hardware configuration into the same machine config pool. Not following this practice might result in TuneD operands calculating conflicting kernel parameters for two or more nodes sharing the same machine config pool.
====
.Example: Node or pod label based matching

[source,yaml]
----
- match:
  - label: tuned.openshift.io/elasticsearch
    match:
    - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
    type: pod
  priority: 10
  profile: openshift-control-plane-es
- match:
  - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
  - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
  priority: 20
  profile: openshift-control-plane
- priority: 30
  profile: openshift-node
----

The CR above is translated for the containerized TuneD daemon into its `recommend.conf` file based on the profile priorities. The profile with the highest priority (`10`) is `openshift-control-plane-es` and, therefore, it is considered first. The containerized TuneD daemon running on a given node looks to see if there is a pod running on the same node with the `tuned.openshift.io/elasticsearch` label set. If not, the entire `<match>` section evaluates as `false`. If there is such a pod with the label, in order for the `<match>` section to evaluate to `true`, the node label also needs to be `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` or `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra`.

If the labels for the profile with priority `10` matched, `openshift-control-plane-es` profile is applied and no other profile is considered. If the node/pod label combination did not match, the second highest priority profile (`openshift-control-plane`) is considered. This profile is applied if the containerized TuneD pod runs on a node with labels `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` or `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra`.

Finally, the profile `openshift-node` has the lowest priority of `30`. It lacks the `<match>` section and, therefore, will always match. It acts as a profile catch-all to set `openshift-node` profile, if no other profile with higher priority matches on a given node.

*Cloud provider-specific TuneD profiles*

With this functionality, all Cloud provider-specific nodes can conveniently be assigned a TuneD profile specifically tailored to a given Cloud provider on a {product-title} cluster. This can be accomplished without adding additional node labels or grouping nodes into
machine config pools.

This functionality takes advantage of `spec.providerID` node object values in the form of `<cloud-provider>://<cloud-provider-specific-id>` and writes the file `/var/lib/tuned/provider` with the value `<cloud-provider>` in NTO operand containers.  The content of this file is then used by TuneD to load `provider-<cloud-provider>` profile if such profile exists.

The `openshift` profile that both `openshift-control-plane` and `openshift-node` profiles inherit settings from is now updated to use this functionality through the use of conditional profile loading. Neither NTO nor TuneD currently include any Cloud provider-specific profiles. However, it is possible to create a custom profile `provider-<cloud-provider>` that will be applied to all Cloud provider-specific cluster nodes.

= Configuring the maximum number of pods per node

Two parameters control the maximum number of pods that can be scheduled to a node: `podsPerCore` and `maxPods`. If you use both options, the lower of the two limits the number of pods on a node.

For example, if `podsPerCore` is set to `10` on a node with 4 processor cores, the maximum number of pods allowed on the node will be 40.

.Prerequisites

. Obtain the label associated with the static `MachineConfigPool` CRD for the type of node you want to configure by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineconfigpool <name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]

[NOTE]
====
Setting `podsPerCore` to `0` disables this limit.
====

:leveloffset: 3

After you configure a machine set to request a static IP address for a machine, the machine controller creates an `IPAddressClaim` resource in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace. The external controller then creates an `IPAddress` resource and binds any static IP addresses to the `IPAddressClaim` resource.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Your organization might use numerous types of IP address management (IPAM) services. If you want to enable a particular IPAM service on {product-title}, you might need to manually create the `IPAddressClaim` resource in a YAML definition and then bind a static IP address to this resource by entering the following command in your `oc` CLI:

[source, terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <ipaddressclaim_filename>
----
====

The following demonstrates an example of an `IPAddressClaim` resource:

[source, yaml]
----

spec:
  poolRef:
    apiGroup: ipamcontroller.example.io
    kind: IPPool
    name: static-ci-pool
status: {}
----

The machine controller updates the machine with a status of `IPAddressClaimed` to indicate that a static IP address has succesfully bound to the `IPAddressClaim` resource. The machine controller applies the same status to a machine with multiple `IPAddressClaim` resources that each contain a bound static IP address.The machine controller then creates a virtual machine and applies static IP addresses to any nodes listed in the `providerSpec` of a machine's configuration.

----
<1> Specifies an IP pool, which lists a static IP address or a range of static IP addresses. The IP Pool can either be a reference to a custom resource definition (CRD) or a resource supported by the `IPAddressClaims` resource handler. The machine controller accesses static IP addresses listed in the machine set's configuration and then allocates each address to each machine.
<2> Lists a nameserver. You must specify a nameserver for nodes that receive static IP address, because the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) network configuration does not support static IP addresses.

. Scale the machine set by entering the following commands in your `oc` CLI:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Or:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
After each machine is scaled up, the machine controller creates an `IPAddresssClaim` resource.

. Optional: Check that the `IPAddressClaim` resource exists in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace by entering the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get ipaddressclaims.ipam.cluster.x-k8s.io -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
.Example `oc` CLI output that lists two IP pools listed in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace
[source, terminal]
----

cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-claim-0-0   static-ci-pool   IPPool
cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-wdqkt-claim-0-0   static-ci-pool   IPPool
----

. Create an `IPAddress` resource by entering the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc create -f ipaddress.yaml
----
+
The following example shows an `IPAddress` resource with defined network configuration information and one defined static IP address:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ipam.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: IPAddress
metadata:
  name: cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-ipaddress-0-0
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
  address: 192.168.204.129
  claimRef: <1>
    name: cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-claim-0-0

  poolRef: <2>
    apiGroup: ipamcontroller.example.io
    kind: IPPool
    name: static-ci-pool
  prefix: 23
----
<1> The name of the target `IPAddressClaim` resource.
<2> Details information about the static IP address or addresses from your nodes.
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, the external controller automatically scans any resources in the machine set for recognizable address pool types. When the external controller finds `kind: IPPool` defined in the `IPAddress` resource, the controller binds any static IP addresses to the `IPAddressClaim` resource.
====

. Update the `IPAddressClaim` status with a reference to the `IPAddress` resource:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc --type=merge patch IPAddressClaim cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-claim-0-0 -p='{"status":{"addressRef": {"name": "cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-ipaddress-0-0"}}}' -n openshift-machine-api --subresource=status

[id="nw-operator-cr_{context}"]
= Cluster Network Operator configuration

The configuration for the cluster network is specified as part of the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration and stored in a custom resource (CR) object that is named `cluster`. The CR specifies the fields for the `Network` API in the `operator.openshift.io` API group.

The CNO configuration inherits the following fields during cluster installation from the `Network` API in the `Network.config.openshift.io` API group:

`clusterNetwork`:: IP address pools from which pod IP addresses are allocated.
`serviceNetwork`:: IP address pool for services.
`defaultNetwork.type`:: Cluster network plugin, such as OpenShift SDN or OVN-Kubernetes.

// For the post installation assembly, no further content is provided.
[NOTE]
====
After cluster installation, you can only modify the `clusterNetwork` IP address range. The default network type can only be changed from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes through migration.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="nw-proxy-configure-object_{context}"]
= Enabling the cluster-wide proxy

The `Proxy` object is used to manage the cluster-wide egress proxy. When a cluster is installed or upgraded without the proxy configured, a `Proxy` object is still generated but it will have a nil `spec`. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Proxy
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  trustedCA:
    name: ""
status:
----

A cluster administrator can configure the proxy for {product-title} by modifying this `cluster` `Proxy` object.

[NOTE]
====
Only the `Proxy` object named `cluster` is supported, and no additional proxies can be created.
====

.Prerequisites

* Cluster administrator permissions
* {product-title} `oc` CLI tool installed

.Procedure

. Create a config map that contains any additional CA certificates required for proxying HTTPS connections.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can skip this step if the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust bundle.
====

.. Create a file called `user-ca-bundle.yaml` with the following contents, and provide the values of your PEM-encoded certificates:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: | <1>
    <MY_PEM_ENCODED_CERTS> <2>
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-ca-bundle <3>
  namespace: openshift-config <4>
----
<1> This data key must be named `ca-bundle.crt`.
<2> One or more PEM-encoded X.509 certificates used to sign the proxy's
identity certificate.
<3> The config map name that will be referenced from the `Proxy` object.
<4> The config map must be in the `openshift-config` namespace.

.. Create the config map from this file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f user-ca-bundle.yaml
----

. Use the `oc edit` command to modify the `Proxy` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit proxy/cluster
----

. Configure the necessary fields for the proxy:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Proxy
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> <1>
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> <2>
  noProxy: example.com <3>
  readinessEndpoints:
  - http://www.google.com <4>
  - https://www.google.com
  trustedCA:
    name: user-ca-bundle <5>
----
+
--
<1> A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be `http`.
<2> A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be either `http` or `https`. Specify a URL for the proxy that supports the URL scheme. For example, most proxies will report an error if they are configured to use `https` but they only support `http`. This failure message may not propagate to the logs and can appear to be a network connection failure instead. If using a proxy that listens for `https` connections from the cluster, you may need to configure the cluster to accept the CAs and certificates that the proxy uses.
<3> A comma-separated list of destination domain names, domains, IP addresses or other network CIDRs to exclude proxying.
+
Preface a domain with `.` to match subdomains only. For example, `.y.com` matches `x.y.com`, but not `y.com`. Use `*` to bypass proxy for all destinations.
If you scale up workers that are not included in the network defined by the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr` field from the installation configuration, you must add them to this list to prevent connection issues.
+
This field is ignored if neither the `httpProxy` or `httpsProxy` fields are set.
<4> One or more URLs external to the cluster to use to perform a readiness check before writing the `httpProxy` and `httpsProxy` values to status.
<5> A reference to the config map in the `openshift-config` namespace that contains additional CA certificates required for proxying HTTPS connections. Note that the config map must already exist before referencing it here. This field is required unless the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust bundle.

[id="private-clusters-setting-dns-private_{context}"]
= Setting DNS to private

After you deploy a cluster, you can modify its DNS to use only a private zone.

.Procedure

. Review the `DNS` custom resource for your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get dnses.config.openshift.io/cluster -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----

      kubernetes.io/cluster/<infrastructure_id>: owned
  publicZone:
    id: Z2XXXXXXXXXXA4
status: {}
----
+
Note that the `spec` section contains both a private and a public zone.

. Patch the `DNS` custom resource to remove the public zone:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch dnses.config.openshift.io/cluster --type=merge --patch='{"spec": {"publicZone": null}}'
dns.config.openshift.io/cluster patched
----
+
Because the Ingress Controller consults the `DNS` definition when it creates `Ingress` objects, when you create or modify `Ingress` objects, only private records are created.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
DNS records for the existing Ingress objects are not modified when you remove the public zone.
====

. Optional: Review the `DNS` custom resource for your cluster and confirm that the public zone was removed:

== Configuring ingress cluster traffic

// This section is sourced from networking/configuring_ingress_cluster_traffic/overview-traffic.adoc

{product-title} provides the following methods for communicating from outside the cluster with services running in the cluster:

* If you have HTTP/HTTPS, use an Ingress Controller.
* If you have a TLS-encrypted protocol other than HTTPS, such as TLS with the SNI header, use an Ingress Controller.
* Otherwise, use a load balancer, an external IP, or a node port.

== Configuring the node port service range

As a cluster administrator, you can expand the available node port range. If your cluster uses of a large number of node ports, you might need to increase the number of available ports.

The default port range is `30000-32767`. You can never reduce the port range, even if you first expand it beyond the default range.

[id="post-install-configuring-node-port-service-range-prerequisites"]
=== Prerequisites

- Your cluster infrastructure must allow access to the ports that you specify within the expanded range. For example, if you expand the node port range to `30000-32900`, the inclusive port range of `32768-32900` must be allowed by your firewall or packet filtering configuration.

[id="post-install-configuring-network-policy"]
== Configuring network policy

As a cluster administrator or project administrator, you can configure network policies for a project.

:leveloffset: +2

[id="nw-networkpolicy-about_{context}"]
= About network policy

In a cluster using a network plugin that supports Kubernetes network policy, network isolation is controlled entirely by `NetworkPolicy` objects.
In {product-title} {product-version}, OpenShift SDN supports using network policy in its default network isolation mode.

[WARNING]
====
Network policy does not apply to the host network namespace. Pods with host networking enabled are unaffected by network policy rules. However, pods connecting to the host-networked pods might be affected by the network policy rules.

Network policies cannot block traffic from localhost or from their resident nodes.
====

By default, all pods in a project are accessible from other pods and network endpoints. To isolate one or more pods in a project, you can create `NetworkPolicy` objects in that project to indicate the allowed incoming connections. Project administrators can create and delete `NetworkPolicy` objects within their own project.

If a pod is matched by selectors in one or more `NetworkPolicy` objects, then the pod will accept only connections that are allowed by at least one of those `NetworkPolicy` objects. A pod that is not selected by any `NetworkPolicy` objects is fully accessible.

A network policy applies to only the TCP, UDP, ICMP, and SCTP protocols. Other protocols are not affected.

The following example `NetworkPolicy` objects demonstrate supporting different scenarios:

* Deny all traffic:
+
To make a project deny by default, add a `NetworkPolicy` object that matches all pods but accepts no traffic:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-by-default
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress: []
----

* Only allow connections from the {product-title} Ingress Controller:
+
To make a project allow only connections from the {product-title} Ingress Controller, add the following `NetworkPolicy` object.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
----

* Only accept connections from pods within a project:
+
To make pods accept connections from other pods in the same project, but reject all other connections from pods in other projects, add the following `NetworkPolicy` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-same-namespace
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
----

* Only allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic based on pod labels:
+
To enable only HTTP and HTTPS access to the pods with a specific label (`role=frontend` in following example), add a `NetworkPolicy` object similar to the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-http-and-https
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: frontend
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443
----

* Accept connections by using both namespace and pod selectors:
+
To match network traffic by combining namespace and pod selectors, you can use a `NetworkPolicy` object similar to the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-pod-and-namespace-both
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      name: test-pods
  ingress:
    - from:
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            project: project_name
        podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            name: test-pods
----

`NetworkPolicy` objects are additive, which means you can combine multiple `NetworkPolicy` objects together to satisfy complex network requirements.

For example, for the `NetworkPolicy` objects defined in previous samples, you can define both `allow-same-namespace` and `allow-http-and-https` policies within the same project. Thus allowing the pods with the label `role=frontend`, to accept any connection allowed by each policy. That is, connections on any port from pods in the same namespace, and connections on ports `80` and `443` from pods in any namespace.

[id="post-installationrouting-optimization"]
== Optimizing routing

The {product-title} HAProxy router can be scaled or configured to optimize performance.

// * post_installation_configuration/network-configuration.adoc

[id="baseline-router-performance_{context}"]
= Baseline Ingress Controller (router) performance

The {product-title} Ingress Controller, or router, is the ingress point for ingress traffic for applications and services that are configured using routes and ingresses.

When evaluating a single HAProxy router performance in terms of HTTP requests handled per second, the performance varies depending on many factors. In particular:

* HTTP keep-alive/close mode

* Route type

* TLS session resumption client support

* Number of concurrent connections per target route

* Number of target routes

* Back end server page size

* Underlying infrastructure (network/SDN solution, CPU, and so on)

While performance in your specific environment will vary, Red Hat lab tests on a public cloud instance of size 4 vCPU/16GB RAM. A single HAProxy router handling 100 routes terminated by backends serving 1kB static pages is able to handle the following number of transactions per second.

In HTTP keep-alive mode scenarios:

[cols="3",options="header"]
|===
|*Encryption* |*LoadBalancerService*|*HostNetwork*
|none |21515|29622
|edge |16743|22913
|passthrough |36786|53295
|re-encrypt |21583|25198
|===

In HTTP close (no keep-alive) scenarios:

[cols="3",options="header"]
|===
|*Encryption* |*LoadBalancerService*|*HostNetwork*
|none |5719|8273
|edge |2729|4069
|passthrough |4121|5344
|re-encrypt |2320|2941
|===

The default Ingress Controller configuration was used with the `spec.tuningOptions.threadCount` field set to `4`. Two different endpoint publishing strategies were tested: Load Balancer Service and Host Network. TLS session resumption was used for encrypted routes. With HTTP keep-alive, a single HAProxy router is capable of saturating a 1 Gbit NIC at page sizes as small as 8 kB.

When running on bare metal with modern processors, you can expect roughly twice the performance of the public cloud instance above. This overhead is introduced by the virtualization layer in place on public clouds and holds mostly true for private cloud-based virtualization as well. The following table is a guide to how many applications to use behind the router:

[cols="2,4",options="header"]
|===
|*Number of applications* |*Application type*
|5-10 |static file/web server or caching proxy
|100-1000 |applications generating dynamic content

|===

In general, HAProxy can support routes for up to 1000 applications, depending on the technology in use. Ingress Controller performance might be limited by the
capabilities and performance of the applications behind it, such as language or static versus dynamic content.

Ingress, or router, sharding should be used to serve more routes towards applications and help horizontally scale the routing tier.

[id="ingress-liveness-readiness-startup-probes_{context}"]
= Configuring Ingress Controller liveness, readiness, and startup probes

Cluster administrators can configure the timeout values for the kubelet's liveness, readiness, and startup probes for router deployments that are managed by the {product-title} Ingress Controller (router). The liveness and readiness probes of the router use the default timeout value
of 1 second, which is too brief when networking or runtime performance is severely degraded. Probe timeouts can cause unwanted router restarts that interrupt application connections. The ability to set larger timeout values can reduce the risk of unnecessary and unwanted restarts.

You can update the `timeoutSeconds` value on the `livenessProbe`, `readinessProbe`, and `startupProbe` parameters of the router container.

[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
 |Parameter |Description

 |`livenessProbe`
 |The `livenessProbe` reports to the kubelet whether a pod is dead and needs to be restarted.

 |`readinessProbe`
 |The `readinessProbe` reports whether a pod is healthy or unhealthy. When the readiness probe reports an unhealthy pod, then the kubelet marks the pod as not ready to accept traffic. Subsequently, the endpoints for that pod are marked as not ready, and this status propagates to the kube-proxy. On cloud platforms with a configured load balancer, the kube-proxy communicates to the cloud load-balancer not to send traffic to the node with that pod.

 |`startupProbe`
 |The `startupProbe` gives the router pod up to 2 minutes to initialize before the kubelet begins sending the router liveness and readiness probes.  This initialization time can prevent routers with many routes or endpoints from prematurely restarting.
|===


[IMPORTANT]
====
The timeout configuration option is an advanced tuning technique that can be used to work around issues. However, these issues should eventually be diagnosed and possibly a support case or https://issues.redhat.com/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=12332330&summary=Summary&issuetype=1&priority=10200&versions=12385624[Jira issue] opened for any issues that causes probes to time out.
====

The following example demonstrates how you can directly patch the default router deployment to set a 5-second timeout for the liveness and readiness probes:


[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-ingress patch deploy/router-default --type=strategic --patch='{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"router","livenessProbe":{"timeoutSeconds":5},"readinessProbe":{"timeoutSeconds":5}}]}}}}'

[id="configuring-haproxy-interval_{context}"]
= Configuring HAProxy reload interval

When you update a route or an endpoint associated with a route, {product-title} router updates the configuration for HAProxy. Then, HAProxy reloads the updated configuration for those changes to take effect. When HAProxy reloads, it generates a new process that handles new connections using the updated configuration.

HAProxy keeps the old process running to handle existing connections until those connections are all closed. When old processes have long-lived connections, these processes can accumulate and consume resources.

The default minimum HAProxy reload interval is five seconds. You can configure an Ingress Controller using its `spec.tuningOptions.reloadInterval` field to set a longer minimum reload interval.

[WARNING]
====
Setting a large value for the minimum HAProxy reload interval can cause latency in observing updates to routes and their endpoints. To lessen the risk, avoid setting a value larger than the tolerable latency for updates.
====

.Procedure

* Change the minimum HAProxy reload interval of the default Ingress Controller to 15 seconds by running the following command:

[id="about_{context}"]
= About dynamic provisioning

The `StorageClass` resource object describes and classifies storage that can
be requested, as well as provides a means for passing parameters for
dynamically provisioned storage on demand. `StorageClass` objects can also
serve as a management mechanism for controlling different levels of
storage and access to the storage. Cluster Administrators (`cluster-admin`)
 or Storage Administrators (`storage-admin`) define and create the
`StorageClass` objects that users can request without needing any detailed
knowledge about the underlying storage volume sources.

The {product-title} persistent volume framework enables this functionality
and allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent storage.
The framework also gives users a way to request those resources without
having any knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

Many storage types are available for use as persistent volumes in
{product-title}. While all of them can be statically provisioned by an
administrator, some types of storage are created dynamically using the
built-in provider and plugin APIs.

[id="available-plug-ins_{context}"]
= Available dynamic provisioning plugins

{product-title} provides the following provisioner plugins, which have
generic implementations for dynamic provisioning that use the cluster's
configured provider's API to create new storage resources:


[options="header",cols="1,1,1"]
|===

|Storage type
|Provisioner plugin name
|Notes

|{rh-openstack-first} Cinder
|`kubernetes.io/cinder`
|

|{rh-openstack} Manila Container Storage Interface (CSI)
|`manila.csi.openstack.org`
|Once installed, the OpenStack Manila CSI Driver Operator and ManilaDriver automatically create the required storage classes for all available Manila share types needed for dynamic provisioning.

|Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
|`kubernetes.io/aws-ebs`
|For dynamic provisioning when using multiple clusters in different zones,
tag each node with `Key=kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster_name>,Value=<cluster_id>`
where `<cluster_name>` and `<cluster_id>` are unique per cluster.

|Azure Disk
|`kubernetes.io/azure-disk`
|

|Azure File
|`kubernetes.io/azure-file`
|The `persistent-volume-binder` service account requires permissions to create
and get secrets to store the Azure storage account and keys.

|GCE Persistent Disk (gcePD)
|`kubernetes.io/gce-pd`
|In multi-zone configurations, it is advisable to run one {product-title}
cluster per GCE project to avoid PVs from being created in zones where
no node in the current cluster exists.

|{ibm-power-server-name} Block
|`powervs.csi.ibm.com`
|After installation, the {ibm-power-server-name} Block CSI Driver Operator and {ibm-power-server-name} Block CSI Driver automatically create the required storage classes for dynamic provisioning.

[id="defining-storage-classes_{context}"]
= Defining a storage class

`StorageClass` objects are currently a globally scoped object and must be
created by `cluster-admin` or `storage-admin` users.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Cluster Storage Operator might install a default storage class depending
on the platform in use. This storage class is owned and controlled by the
Operator. It cannot be deleted or modified beyond defining annotations
and labels. If different behavior is desired, you must define a custom
storage class.
====

The following sections describe the basic definition for a
`StorageClass` object and specific examples for each of the supported plugin types.

:leveloffset: 1

:leveloffset: +2

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * storage/dynamic-provisioning.adoc
// * post_installation_configuration/storage-configuration.adoc
// * microshift_storage/dynamic-provisioning-microshift.adoc


[id="basic-storage-class-definition_{context}"]
= Basic StorageClass object definition

The following resource shows the parameters and default values that you
use to configure a storage class. This example uses the AWS
ElasticBlockStore (EBS) object definition.

.Sample `StorageClass` definition
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass <1>
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1 <2>
metadata:
  name: <storage-class-name> <3>
  annotations: <4>
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: 'true'
    ...
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs <5>
parameters: <6>
  type: gp3
...
----
<1> (required) The API object type.
<2> (required) The current apiVersion.
<3> (required) The name of the storage class.
<4> (optional) Annotations for the storage class.
<5> (required) The type of provisioner associated with this storage class.
<6> (optional) The parameters required for the specific provisioner, this
will change from plugin to plug-iin.

// * microshift_storage/dynamic-provisioning-microshift.adoc


[id="storage-class-annotations_{context}"]
= Storage class annotations

To set a storage class as the cluster-wide default, add
the following annotation to your storage class metadata:

[source,yaml]
----
storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
----

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  annotations:
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
...
----

This enables any persistent volume claim (PVC) that does not specify a
specific storage class to automatically be provisioned through the
default storage class. However, your cluster can have more than one storage class, but only one of them can be the default storage class.

[NOTE]
====
The beta annotation `storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` is
still working; however, it will be removed in a future release.
====

To set a storage class description, add the following annotation
to your storage class metadata:

[source,yaml]
----
kubernetes.io/description: My Storage Class Description
----

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/description: My Storage Class Description

round-robined across all active zones where the {product-title} cluster
has a node.
<4> File system that is created on dynamically provisioned volumes. This

See the
link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html[AWS documentation]
for valid Amazon Resource Name (ARN) values.
<3> Optional: Only for *io1* volumes. I/O operations per second per GiB.
The AWS volume plugin multiplies this with the size of the requested
volume to compute IOPS of the volume. The value cap is 20,000 IOPS, which
is the maximum supported by AWS. See the
link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html[AWS documentation]
for further details.
<4> Optional: Denotes whether to encrypt the EBS volume. Valid values
are `true` or `false`.
<5> Optional: The full ARN of the key to use when encrypting the volume.
If none is supplied, but `encypted` is set to `true`, then AWS generates a
key. See the
link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html[AWS documentation]
for a valid ARN value.
<6> Optional: File system that is created on dynamically provisioned

<2> Using `WaitForFirstConsumer` is strongly recommended. This provisions the volume while allowing enough storage to schedule the pod on a free worker node from an available zone.
<3> Possible values are `Shared` (default), `Managed`, and `Dedicated`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat only supports the use of `kind: Managed` in the storage class.

With `Shared` and `Dedicated`, Azure creates unmanaged disks, while {product-title} creates a managed disk for machine OS (root) disks. But because Azure Disk does not allow the use of both managed and unmanaged disks on a node, unmanaged disks created with `Shared` or `Dedicated` cannot be attached to {product-title} nodes.
====

<4> Azure storage account SKU tier. Default is empty. Note that Premium VMs can attach both `Standard_LRS` and `Premium_LRS` disks, Standard VMs can only attach `Standard_LRS` disks, Managed VMs can only attach managed disks, and unmanaged VMs can only attach unmanaged disks.
+
.. If `kind` is set to `Shared`, Azure creates all unmanaged disks in a few shared storage accounts in the same resource group as the cluster.
.. If `kind` is set to `Managed`, Azure creates new managed disks.
.. If `kind` is set to `Dedicated` and a `storageAccount` is specified, Azure uses the specified storage account for the new unmanaged disk in the same resource group as the cluster. For this to work:
 * The specified storage account must be in the same region.
 * Azure Cloud Provider must have write access to the storage account.
.. If `kind` is set to `Dedicated` and a `storageAccount` is not specified, Azure creates a new dedicated storage account for the new unmanaged disk in the same resource group as the cluster.

----
<1> Name of the storage class. The persistent volume claim uses this storage class for provisioning the associated persistent volumes.
<2> Location of the Azure storage account, such as `eastus`. Default is empty, meaning that a new Azure storage account will be created in the {product-title} cluster's location.
<3> SKU tier of the Azure storage account, such as `Standard_LRS`. Default is empty, meaning that a new Azure storage account will be created with the `Standard_LRS` SKU.
<4> Name of the Azure storage account. If a storage account is provided, then
`skuName` and `location` are ignored. If no storage account is provided, then
the storage class searches for any storage account that is associated with the
resource group for any accounts that match the defined `skuName` and `location`.

= Considerations when using Azure File

The following file system features are not supported by the default Azure File storage class:

* Symlinks
* Hard links
* Extended attributes
* Sparse files
* Named pipes

Additionally, the owner user identifier (UID) of the Azure File mounted directory is different from the process UID of the container. The `uid` mount option can be specified in the `StorageClass` object to define
a specific user identifier to use for the mounted directory.

The following `StorageClass` object demonstrates modifying the user and group identifier, along with enabling symlinks for the mounted directory.

= Changing the default storage class

Use the following procedure to change the default storage class.

For example, if you have two defined storage classes, `gp3` and `standard`, and you want to change the default storage class from `gp3` to `standard`.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster with cluster-admin privileges.

.Procedure

To change the default storage class:

. List the storage classes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get storageclass
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                 TYPE
gp3 (default)        kubernetes.io/aws-ebs <1>
standard             kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
----
<1> `(default)` indicates the default storage class.

. Make the desired storage class the default.
+
For the desired storage class, set the `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` annotation to `true` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch storageclass standard -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": {"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class": "true"}}}'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can have multiple default storage classes for a short time. However, you should ensure that only one default storage class exists eventually.

With multiple default storage classes present, any persistent volume claim (PVC) requesting the default storage class (`pvc.spec.storageClassName`=nil) gets the most recently created default storage class, regardless of the default status of that storage class, and the administrator receives an alert in the alerts dashboard that there are multiple default storage classes, `MultipleDefaultStorageClasses`.

// add xref to multi/no default SC module
====

. Remove the default storage class setting from the old default storage class.
+
For the old default storage class, change the value of the `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` annotation to `false` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch storageclass gp3 -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": {"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class": "false"}}}'
----

. Verify the changes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get storageclass
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                 TYPE
gp3                  kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
standard (default)   kubernetes.io/aws-ebs

== Optimizing storage

Optimizing storage helps to minimize storage use across all resources. By
optimizing storage, administrators help ensure that existing storage resources
are working in an efficient manner.

|Block
a|* Presented to the operating system (OS) as a block device
* Suitable for applications that need full control of storage and operate at a low level on files
bypassing the file system
* Also referred to as a Storage Area Network (SAN)
* Non-shareable, which means that only one client at a time can mount an endpoint of this type
| AWS EBS and VMware vSphere support dynamic persistent volume (PV) provisioning natively in {product-title}.
// Ceph RBD, OpenStack Cinder, Azure Disk, GCE persistent disk

|File
a| * Presented to the OS as a file system export to be mounted
* Also referred to as Network Attached Storage (NAS)
* Concurrency, latency, file locking mechanisms, and other capabilities vary widely between protocols, implementations, vendors, and scales.
|RHEL NFS, NetApp NFS ^[1]^, and Vendor NFS
// Azure File, AWS EFS

| Object
a| * Accessible through a REST API endpoint
* Configurable for use in the {product-registry}
* Applications must build their drivers into the application and/or container.
| AWS S3
// Aliyun OSS, Ceph Object Storage (RADOS Gateway)

^2^ `ReadWriteMany`

^3^ Prometheus is the underlying technology used for metrics.

^4^ This does not apply to physical disk, VM physical disk, VMDK, loopback over NFS, AWS EBS, and Azure Disk.

^5^ For metrics, using file storage with the `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode is unreliable. If you use file storage, do not configure the RWX access mode on any persistent volume claims (PVCs) that are configured for use with metrics.

^6^ For logging, review the recommended storage solution in Configuring persistent storage for the log store section. Using NFS storage as a persistent volume or through NAS, such as Gluster, can corrupt the data. Hence, NFS is not supported for Elasticsearch storage and LokiStack log store in {product-title} Logging. You must use one persistent volume type per log store.

^7^ Object storage is not consumed through {product-title}'s PVs or PVCs. Apps must integrate with the object storage REST API.

|===

[NOTE]
====
A scaled registry is an {product-registry} where two or more pod replicas are running.
====

== Specific application storage recommendations

[IMPORTANT]
====
Testing shows issues with using the NFS server on {op-system-base-full} as storage backend for core services. This includes the OpenShift Container Registry and Quay, Prometheus for monitoring storage, and Elasticsearch for logging storage. Therefore, using {op-system-base} NFS to back PVs used by core services is not recommended.

Other NFS implementations on the marketplace might not have these issues. Contact the individual NFS implementation vendor for more information on any testing that was possibly completed against these {product-title} core components.
====

=== Registry

In a non-scaled/high-availability (HA) {product-registry} cluster deployment:

* The storage technology does not have to support RWX access mode.
* The storage technology must ensure read-after-write consistency.
* The preferred storage technology is object storage followed by block storage.
* File storage is not recommended for {product-registry} cluster deployment with production workloads.

=== Scaled registry

In a scaled/HA {product-registry} cluster deployment:

* The storage technology must support RWX access mode.
* The storage technology must ensure read-after-write consistency.
* The preferred storage technology is object storage.
* Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, and OpenStack Swift are supported.
* Object storage should be S3 or Swift compliant.
* For non-cloud platforms, such as vSphere and bare metal installations, the only configurable technology is file storage.
* Block storage is not configurable.

=== Metrics

In an {product-title} hosted metrics cluster deployment:

* The preferred storage technology is block storage.
* Object storage is not configurable.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not recommended to use file storage for a hosted metrics cluster deployment with production workloads.
====

=== Logging

In an {product-title} hosted logging cluster deployment:

* {loki-op}:
** The preferred storage technology is S3 compatible Object storage.
** Block storage is not configurable.

* {es-op}:
** The preferred storage technology is block storage.
** Object storage is not supported.

[NOTE]
====
As of logging version 5.4.3 the {es-op} is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed. As an alternative to using the {es-op} to manage the default log storage, you can use the {loki-op}.
====


=== Applications

Application use cases vary from application to application, as described in the following examples:

* Storage technologies that support dynamic PV provisioning have low mount time latencies, and are not tied to nodes to support a healthy cluster.
* Application developers are responsible for knowing and understanding the storage requirements for their application, and how it works with the provided storage to ensure that issues do not occur when an application scales or interacts with the storage layer.

== Other specific application storage recommendations

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not recommended to use RAID configurations on `Write` intensive workloads, such as `etcd`. If you are running `etcd` with a RAID configuration, you might be at risk of encountering performance issues with your workloads.
====

* {rh-openstack-first} Cinder: {rh-openstack} Cinder tends to be adept in ROX access mode use cases.
* Databases: Databases (RDBMSs, NoSQL DBs, etc.) tend to perform best with dedicated block storage.
* The etcd database must have enough storage and adequate performance capacity to enable a large cluster. Information about monitoring and benchmarking tools to establish ample storage and a high-performance environment is described in _Recommended etcd practices_.

= Identity provider parameters

The following parameters are common to all identity providers:

[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter     | Description
|`name`      | The provider name is prefixed to provider user names to form an
identity name.

|`mappingMethod`  | Defines how new identities are mapped to users when they log in.
Enter one of the following values:

claim:: The default value. Provisions a user with the identity's preferred
user name. Fails if a user with that user name is already mapped to another
identity.
lookup:: Looks up an existing identity, user identity mapping, and user,
but does not automatically provision users or identities. This allows cluster
administrators to set up identities and users manually, or using an external
process. Using this method requires you to manually provision users.
add:: Provisions a user with the identity's preferred user name. If a user
with that user name already exists, the identity is mapped to the existing user,
adding to any existing identity mappings for the user. Required when multiple
identity providers are configured that identify the same set of users and map to
the same user names.
|===

[NOTE]
When adding or changing identity providers, you can map identities from the new
provider to existing users by setting the `mappingMethod` parameter to
`add`.

[id="authorization-overview_{context}"]
= RBAC overview

Role-based access control (RBAC) objects determine whether a user is allowed to
perform a given action within a project.

Cluster administrators
can use the cluster roles and bindings to control who has various access levels to the {product-title} platform itself and all projects.

Developers can use local roles and bindings to control who has access
to their projects. Note that authorization is a separate step from
authentication, which is more about determining the identity of who is taking the action.

Authorization is managed using:

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===

|Authorization object |Description

|Rules |Sets of permitted verbs on a set of objects. For example,
whether a user or service account can `create` pods.

|Roles |Collections of rules. You can associate, or bind, users and groups
to multiple roles.

|Bindings |Associations between users and/or groups with a role.
|===

There are two levels of RBAC roles and bindings that control authorization:

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===

|RBAC level |Description

|Cluster RBAC |Roles and bindings that are applicable across
all projects. _Cluster roles_ exist cluster-wide, and _cluster role bindings_
can reference only cluster roles.

|Local RBAC |Roles and bindings that are scoped to a given project. While
_local roles_ exist only in a single project, local role bindings can
reference _both_ cluster and local roles.

|===

A cluster role binding is a binding that exists at the cluster level.
A role binding exists at the project level. The cluster role _view_ must be
bound to a user using a local role binding for that user to view the project.
Create local roles only if a cluster role does not provide the set
of permissions needed for a particular situation.

This two-level hierarchy allows reuse across multiple projects through the
cluster roles while allowing customization inside of individual projects
through local roles.

During evaluation, both the cluster role bindings and the local role bindings are used.
For example:

. Cluster-wide "allow" rules are checked.
. Locally-bound "allow" rules are checked.
. Deny by default.


[id="default-roles_{context}"]
== Default cluster roles

{product-title} includes a set of default cluster roles that you can bind to users and groups cluster-wide or locally.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not recommended to manually modify the default cluster roles. Modifications to these system roles can prevent a cluster from functioning properly.
====

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===

|Default cluster role |Description

|`admin` |A project manager. If used in a local binding, an `admin` has
rights to view any resource in the project and modify any resource in the
project except for quota.

|`basic-user` |A user that can get basic information about projects and users.

|`cluster-admin` |A super-user that can perform any action in any project. When
bound to a user with a local binding, they have full control over quota and
every action on every resource in the project.

|`cluster-status` |A user that can get basic cluster status information.

|`cluster-reader` | A user that can get or view most of the objects but
cannot modify them.

|`edit` |A user that can modify most objects in a project but does not have the
power to view or modify roles or bindings.

|`self-provisioner` |A user that can create their own projects.

|`view` |A user who cannot make any modifications, but can see most objects in a
project. They cannot view or modify roles or bindings.

|===

Be mindful of the difference between local and cluster bindings. For example,
if you bind the `cluster-admin` role to a user by using a local role binding,
it might appear that this user has the privileges of a cluster administrator.
This is not the case. Binding the `cluster-admin` to a user in a project
grants super administrator privileges for only that project to the user. That user has the permissions of the cluster role `admin`, plus a few additional permissions like the ability to edit rate limits, for that project. This binding can be confusing via the web console UI, which does not list cluster role bindings that are bound to true cluster administrators. However, it does list local role bindings that you can use to locally bind `cluster-admin`.

////
If you do, when you upgrade
your cluster, the default roles are updated and
automatically reconciled when the server is started. During reconciliation, any
permissions that are missing from
the default roles are added. If you added more permissions to the role, they are
not removed.

If you customized the default roles and configured them to prevent automatic
role reconciliation, you must manually update policy definitions
when you upgrade {product-title}.
////


The relationships between cluster roles, local roles, cluster role bindings,
local role bindings, users, groups and service accounts are illustrated below.

image::rbac.png[{product-title} RBAC]

[WARNING]
====
The `get pods/exec`, `get pods/*`, and `get *` rules grant execution privileges when they are applied to a role. Apply the principle of least privilege and assign only the minimal RBAC rights required for users and agents. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6989997[RBAC rules allow execution privileges].
====

[id="evaluating-authorization_{context}"]
== Evaluating authorization

{product-title} evaluates authorization by using:

Identity:: The user name and list of groups that the user belongs to.

Action:: The action you perform. In most cases, this consists of:
* *Project*: The project you access. A project is a Kubernetes namespace with
additional annotations that allows a community of users to organize and manage
their content in isolation from other communities.
* *Verb* : The action itself:  `get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `deletecollection`, or `watch`.
* *Resource name*: The API endpoint that you access.
Bindings:: The full list of bindings, the associations between users or groups
with a role.

{product-title} evaluates authorization by using the following steps:

. The identity and the project-scoped action is used to find all bindings that
apply to the user or their groups.
. Bindings are used to locate all the roles that apply.
. Roles are used to find all the rules that apply.
. The action is checked against each rule to find a match.
. If no matching rule is found, the action is then denied by default.



[TIP]
====
Remember that users and groups can be associated with, or bound to, multiple
roles at the same time.
====

Project administrators can use the CLI to
view local roles and bindings,
including a matrix of the verbs and resources each are associated with.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The cluster role bound to the project administrator is limited in a project
through a local binding. It is not bound cluster-wide like the cluster roles granted to the *cluster-admin* or *system:admin*.

Cluster roles are roles defined at the cluster level but can be bound either at
the cluster level or at the project level.

[id="cluster-role-aggregations_{context}"]
=== Cluster role aggregation
The default admin, edit, view, and cluster-reader cluster roles support
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#aggregated-clusterroles[cluster role aggregation], where the cluster rules for each role are dynamically updated as new rules are created. This feature is relevant only if you extend the Kubernetes API by creating custom resources.

[id="rbac-projects-namespaces_{context}"]
= Projects and namespaces

A Kubernetes _namespace_ provides a mechanism to scope resources in a cluster.
The
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/namespaces/[Kubernetes documentation]
has more information on namespaces.

Namespaces provide a unique scope for:

* Named resources to avoid basic naming collisions.
* Delegated management authority to trusted users.
* The ability to limit community resource consumption.

Most objects in the system are scoped by namespace, but some are
excepted and have no namespace, including nodes and users.

A _project_ is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations and is the central vehicle
by which access to resources for regular users is managed.
A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in
isolation from other communities. Users must be given access to projects by administrators,
or if allowed to create projects, automatically have access to their own projects.

Projects can have a separate `name`, `displayName`, and `description`.

- The mandatory `name` is a unique identifier for the project and is most visible when using the CLI tools or API. The maximum name length is 63 characters.
- The optional `displayName` is how the project is displayed in the web console (defaults to `name`).
- The optional `description` can be a more detailed description of the project and is also visible in the web console.

Each project scopes its own set of:

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===

|Object
|Description

|`Objects`
|Pods, services, replication controllers, etc.

|`Policies`
|Rules for which users can or cannot perform actions on objects.

|`Constraints`
|Quotas for each kind of object that can be limited.

|`Service accounts`
|Service accounts act automatically with designated access to objects in the project.

|===

Cluster administrators
can create projects and delegate administrative rights for the project to any member of the user community.
Cluster administrators
can also allow developers to create their own projects.

Developers and administrators can interact with projects by using the CLI or the
web console.

[id="rbac-default-projects_{context}"]
= Default projects

{product-title} comes with a number of default projects, and projects
starting with `openshift-` are the most essential to users.
These projects host master components that run as pods and other infrastructure
components. The pods created in these namespaces that have a
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/guaranteed-scheduling-critical-addon-pods/#rescheduler-guaranteed-scheduling-of-critical-add-ons[critical pod annotation]
are considered critical, and the have guaranteed admission by kubelet.
Pods created for master components in these namespaces are already marked as
critical.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not run workloads in or share access to default projects. Default projects are reserved for running core cluster components.

The following default projects are considered highly privileged: `default`, `kube-public`, `kube-system`, `openshift`, `openshift-infra`, `openshift-node`, and other system-created projects that have the `openshift.io/run-level` label set to `0` or `1`. Functionality that relies on admission plugins, such as pod security admission, security context constraints, cluster resource quotas, and image reference resolution, does not work in highly privileged projects.

[id="viewing-local-roles_{context}"]
= Viewing local roles and bindings

You can use the `oc` CLI to view local roles and bindings by using the
`oc describe` command.

.Prerequisites

* Install the `oc` CLI.
* Obtain permission to view the local roles and bindings:

** Users with the `cluster-admin` default cluster role bound cluster-wide can
perform any action on any resource, including viewing local roles and bindings.

** Users with the `admin` default cluster role bound locally can view and manage
roles and bindings in that project.

.Procedure

. To view the current set of local role bindings, which show the users and groups
that are bound to various roles for the current project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac
----

. To view the local role bindings for a different project, add the `-n` flag
to the command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac -n joe-project
----

[id="adding-roles_{context}"]
= Adding roles to users

You can use  the `oc adm` administrator CLI to manage the roles and bindings.

Binding, or adding, a role to users or groups gives the user or group the access
that is granted by the role. You can add and remove roles to and from users and
groups using `oc adm policy` commands.

You can bind any of the default cluster roles to local users or groups in your
project.

.Procedure

. Add a role to a user in a specific project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user <role> <user> -n <project>
----
+
For example, you can add the `admin` role to the `alice` user in `joe` project
by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin alice -n joe
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the role to the user:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: admin-0
  namespace: joe
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: admin
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: alice
----
====

. View the local role bindings and verify the addition in the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac -n <project>
----
+
For example, to view the local role bindings for the `joe` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac -n joe

{product-title} creates a cluster administrator, `kubeadmin`, after the
installation process completes.

This user has the `cluster-admin` role automatically applied and is treated
as the root user for the cluster. The password is dynamically generated
and unique to your {product-title} environment. After installation
completes the password is provided in the installation program's output.
For example:

|Parameter |Description

|`allowedRegistriesForImport`
|Limits the container image registries from which normal users can import images. Set this list to the registries that you trust to contain valid images, and that you want applications to be able to import from. Users with permission to create images or `ImageStreamMappings` from the API are not affected by this policy. Typically only cluster administrators have the appropriate permissions.

Every element of this list contains a location of the registry specified by the registry domain name.

`domainName`: Specifies a domain name for the registry. If the registry uses a non-standard `80` or `443` port, the port should be included in the domain name as well.

`insecure`: Insecure indicates whether the registry is secure or insecure. By default, if not otherwise specified, the registry is assumed to be secure.

|`additionalTrustedCA`
|A reference to a config map containing additional CAs that should be trusted during `image stream import`, `pod image pull`, `openshift-image-registry pullthrough`, and builds.

The namespace for this config map is `openshift-config`. The format of the config map is to use the registry hostname as the key, and the PEM-encoded certificate as the value, for each additional registry CA to trust.

|`externalRegistryHostnames`
|Provides the hostnames for the default external image registry. The external hostname should be set only when the image registry is exposed externally. The first value is used in `publicDockerImageRepository` field in image streams. The value must be in `hostname[:port]` format.

|`registrySources`
|Contains configuration that determines how the container runtime should treat individual registries when accessing images for builds and
pods. For instance, whether or not to allow insecure access. It does not contain configuration for the internal cluster registry.

`insecureRegistries`: Registries which do not have a valid TLS certificate or only support HTTP connections. To specify all subdomains, add the asterisk (`\*`) wildcard character as a prefix to the domain name. For example, `*.example.com`. You can specify an individual repository within a registry. For example: `reg1.io/myrepo/myapp:latest`.

`blockedRegistries`: Registries for which image pull and push actions are denied. To specify all subdomains, add the asterisk (`\*`) wildcard character as a prefix to the domain name. For example, `*.example.com`. You can specify an individual repository within a registry. For example: `reg1.io/myrepo/myapp:latest`. All other registries are allowed.

`allowedRegistries`: Registries for which image pull and push actions are allowed. To specify all subdomains, add the asterisk (`\*`) wildcard character as a prefix to the domain name. For example, `*.example.com`. You can specify an individual repository within a registry. For example: `reg1.io/myrepo/myapp:latest`. All other registries are blocked.

`containerRuntimeSearchRegistries`: Registries for which image pull and push actions are allowed using image short names. All other registries are blocked.

Either `blockedRegistries` or `allowedRegistries` can be set, but not both.

|===

[WARNING]
====
When the `allowedRegistries` parameter is defined, all registries, including `registry.redhat.io` and `quay.io` registries and the default {product-registry}, are blocked unless explicitly listed. When using the parameter, to prevent pod failure, add all registries including the `registry.redhat.io` and `quay.io` registries and the `internalRegistryHostname` to the `allowedRegistries` list, as they are required by payload images within your environment. For disconnected clusters, mirror registries should also be added.
====

The `status` field of the `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` resource holds observed values from the cluster.

[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`internalRegistryHostname`
|Set by the Image Registry Operator, which controls the `internalRegistryHostname`. It sets the hostname for the default {product-registry}. The value must be in `hostname[:port]` format. For backward compatibility, you can still use the `OPENSHIFT_DEFAULT_REGISTRY` environment variable, but this setting overrides the environment variable.

|`externalRegistryHostnames`
|Set by the Image Registry Operator, provides the external hostnames for the image registry when it is exposed externally. The first value is used in `publicDockerImageRepository` field in image streams. The values must be in `hostname[:port]` format.

= Configuring image registry settings

You can configure image registry settings by editing the `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` custom resource (CR).
When changes to the registry are applied to the `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` CR, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) performs the following sequential actions:

. Cordons the node
. Applies changes by restarting CRI-O
. Uncordons the node
+
[NOTE]
====
The MCO does not restart nodes when it detects changes.

<4> `registrySources`: Contains configuration that determines whether the container runtime allows or blocks individual registries when accessing images for builds and pods.  Either the `allowedRegistries` parameter or the `blockedRegistries` parameter can be set, but not both. You can also define whether or not to allow access to insecure registries or registries that allow registries that use image short names. This example uses the `allowedRegistries` parameter, which defines the registries that are allowed to be used. The insecure registry `insecure.com` is also allowed. The `registrySources` parameter does not contain configuration for the internal cluster registry.
+
[NOTE]
====
When the `allowedRegistries` parameter is defined, all registries, including the registry.redhat.io and quay.io registries and the default {product-registry}, are blocked unless explicitly listed. If you use the parameter, to prevent pod failure, you must add the `registry.redhat.io` and `quay.io` registries and the `internalRegistryHostname` to the `allowedRegistries` list, as they are required by payload images within your environment. Do not add the `registry.redhat.io` and `quay.io` registries to the `blockedRegistries` list.

When using the `allowedRegistries`, `blockedRegistries`, or `insecureRegistries` parameter, you can specify an individual repository within a registry. For example: `reg1.io/myrepo/myapp:latest`.

Insecure external registries should be avoided to reduce possible security risks.

= Configuring additional trust stores for image registry access

The `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` custom resource can contain a reference to a config map that contains additional certificate authorities to be trusted during image registry access.

.Prerequisites
* The certificate authorities (CA) must be PEM-encoded.

.Procedure

You can create a config map in the `openshift-config` namespace and use its name in `AdditionalTrustedCA` in the `image.config.openshift.io` custom resource to provide additional CAs that should be trusted when contacting external registries.

The config map key is the hostname of a registry with the port for which this CA is to be trusted, and the PEM certificate content is the value, for each additional registry CA to trust.

= Understanding image registry repository mirroring

Setting up container registry repository mirroring enables you to perform the following tasks:

* Configure your {product-title} cluster to redirect requests to pull images from a repository on a source image registry and have it resolved by a repository on a mirrored image registry.
* Identify multiple mirrored repositories for each target repository, to make sure that if one mirror is down, another can be used.

Repository mirroring in {product-title} includes the following attributes:

* Image pulls are resilient to registry downtimes.
* Clusters in disconnected environments can pull images from critical locations, such as quay.io, and have registries behind a company firewall provide the requested images.
* A particular order of registries is tried when an image pull request is made, with the permanent registry typically being the last one tried.
* The mirror information you enter is added to the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file on every node in the {product-title} cluster.
* When a node makes a request for an image from the source repository, it tries each mirrored repository in turn until it finds the requested content. If all mirrors fail, the cluster tries the source repository. If successful, the image is pulled to the node.

Setting up repository mirroring can be done in the following ways:

* At {product-title} installation:
+
By pulling container images needed by {product-title} and then bringing those images behind your company's firewall, you can install {product-title} into a datacenter that is in a disconnected environment.

* After {product-title} installation:
+
If you did not configure mirroring during {product-title} installation, you can do so postinstallation by using any of the following custom resource (CR) objects:
+
--
** `ImageDigestMirrorSet` (IDMS). This object allows you to pull images from a mirrored registry by using digest specifications. The IDMS CR enables you to set a fall back policy that allows or stops continued attempts to pull from the source registry if the image pull fails.
+
** `ImageTagMirrorSet` (ITMS). This object allows you to pull images from a mirrored registry by using image tags. The ITMS CR enables you to set a fall back policy that allows or stops continued attempts to pull from the source registry if the image pull fails.
+
** `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP). This object allows you to pull images from a mirrored registry by using digest specifications. The ICSP CR always falls back to the source registry if the mirrors do not work.
--
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Using an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) object to configure repository mirroring is a deprecated feature. Deprecated functionality is still included in {product-title} and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments. If you have existing YAML files that you used to create `ImageContentSourcePolicy` objects, you can use the `oc adm migrate icsp` command to convert those files to an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` YAML file. For more information, see "Converting ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) files for image registry repository mirroring" in the following section.
====

Each of these custom resource objects identify the following information:
--
* The source of the container image repository you want to mirror.
* A separate entry for each mirror repository you want to offer the content
requested from the source repository.
--

For new clusters, you can use IDMS, ITMS, and ICSP CRs objects as desired. However, using IDMS and ITMS is recommended.

If you upgraded a cluster, any existing ICSP objects remain stable, and both IDMS and ICSP objects are supported. Workloads using ICSP objects continue to function as expected. However, if you want to take advantage of the fallback policies introduced in the IDMS CRs, you can migrate current workloads to IDMS objects by using the `oc adm migrate icsp` command as shown in the *Converting ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) files for image registry repository mirroring* section that follows. Migrating to IDMS objects does not require a cluster reboot.

// Text snippet included in the following modules:
//
// * modules/builds-image-source
// * modules/images-configuration-registry-mirror

:_mod-docs-content-type: SNIPPET


[NOTE]
====
If your cluster uses an `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, `ImageTagMirrorSet`, or `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object to configure repository mirroring, you can use only global pull secrets for mirrored registries. You cannot add a pull secret to a project.

= Configuring image registry repository mirroring

You can create postinstallation mirror configuration custom resources (CR) to redirect image pull requests from a source image registry to a mirrored image registry.

.Prerequisites
* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Configure mirrored repositories, by either:
+
* Setting up a mirrored repository with Red Hat Quay, as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/manage_red_hat_quay/repo-mirroring-in-red-hat-quay[Red Hat Quay Repository Mirroring]. Using Red Hat Quay allows you to copy images from one repository to another and also automatically sync those repositories repeatedly over time.

* Using a tool such as `skopeo` to copy images manually from the source repository to the mirrored repository.
+
For example, after installing the skopeo RPM package on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 or RHEL 8 system, use the `skopeo` command as shown in this example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ skopeo copy \
docker://registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal:latest@sha256:5cf... \
docker://example.io/example/ubi-minimal
----
+
In this example, you have a container image registry that is named `example.io` with an image repository named `example` to which you want to copy the `ubi9/ubi-minimal` image from `registry.access.redhat.com`. After you create the mirrored registry, you can configure your {product-title} cluster to redirect requests made of the source repository to the mirrored repository.

. Log in to your {product-title} cluster.

. Create a postinstallation mirror configuration CR, by using one of the following examples:

* Create an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` or `ImageTagMirrorSet` CR, as needed, replacing the source and mirrors with your own registry and repository pairs and images:

** `NeverContactSource`: Prevents continued attempts to pull the image from the source repository.
<8> Optional: Indicates a namespace inside a registry, which allows you to use any image in that namespace. If you use a registry domain as a source, the object is applied to all repositories from the registry.
<9> Optional: Indicates a registry, which allows you to use any image in that registry. If you specify a registry name, the object is applied to all repositories from a source registry to a mirror registry.

.Troubleshooting repository mirroring

If the repository mirroring procedure does not work as described, use the following information about how repository mirroring works to help troubleshoot the problem.

* The first working mirror is used to supply the pulled image.

= Converting ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) files for image registry repository mirroring

Using an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) object to configure repository mirroring is a deprecated feature. This functionality is still included in {product-title} and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

ICSP objects are being replaced by `ImageDigestMirrorSet` and `ImageTagMirrorSet` objects to configure repository mirroring. If you have existing YAML files that you used to create `ImageContentSourcePolicy` objects, you can use the `oc adm migrate icsp` command to convert those files to an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` YAML file. The command updates the API to the current version, changes the `kind` value to `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, and changes `spec.repositoryDigestMirrors` to `spec.imageDigestMirrors`. The rest of the file is not changed.

Because the migration does not change the `registries.conf` file, the cluster does not need to reboot.

For more information about `ImageDigestMirrorSet` or `ImageTagMirrorSet` objects, see "Configuring image registry repository mirroring" in the previous section.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* Ensure that you have `ImageContentSourcePolicy` objects on your cluster.

.Procedure

. Use the following command to convert one or more `ImageContentSourcePolicy` YAML files to an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm migrate icsp <file_name>.yaml <file_name>.yaml <file_name>.yaml --dest-dir <path_to_the_directory>
----
+
--
where:

`<file_name>`:: Specifies the name of the source `ImageContentSourcePolicy` YAML. You can list multiple file names.
`--dest-dir`:: Optional: Specifies a directory for the output `ImageDigestMirrorSet` YAML. If unset, the file is written to the current directory.
--
+
For example, the following command converts the `icsp.yaml` and `icsp-2.yaml` file and saves the new YAML files to the `idms-files` directory.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm migrate icsp icsp.yaml icsp-2.yaml --dest-dir idms-files
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
wrote ImageDigestMirrorSet to idms-files/imagedigestmirrorset_ubi8repo.5911620242173376087.yaml
wrote ImageDigestMirrorSet to idms-files/imagedigestmirrorset_ubi9repo.6456931852378115011.yaml
----

. Create the CR object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <path_to_the_directory>/<file-name>.yaml
----
+
--
where:

`<path_to_the_directory>`:: Specifies the path to the directory, if you used the `--dest-dir` flag.
`<file_name>`:: Specifies the name of the `ImageDigestMirrorSet` YAML.
--

. Remove the ICSP objects after the IDMS objects are rolled out.

[id="olm-creating-catalog-from-index_{context}"]
= Adding a catalog source to a cluster

Adding a catalog source to an {product-title} cluster enables the discovery and installation of Operators for users.
Cluster administrators
can create a `CatalogSource` object that references an index image. OperatorHub uses catalog sources to populate the user interface.

// In OSD/ROSA, a dedicated-admin can see catalog sources here, but can't add, edit, or delete them.
[TIP]
====
Alternatively, you can use the web console to manage catalog sources. From the *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings* -> *Configuration* -> *OperatorHub* page, click the *Sources* tab, where you can create, update, delete, disable, and enable individual sources.
====

// In OSD/ROSA, a dedicated-admin can update catalog sources in the console by searching for them.

.Prerequisites

* You built and pushed an index image to a registry.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Create a `CatalogSource` object that references your index image.
If you used the `oc adm catalog mirror` command to mirror your catalog to a target registry, you can use the generated `catalogSource.yaml` file in your manifests directory as a starting point.

.. Modify the following to your specifications and save it as a `catalogSource.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1

  publisher: <publisher_name> <5>
  updateStrategy:
    registryPoll: <6>
      interval: 30m
----
<1> If you mirrored content to local files before uploading to a registry, remove any backslash (`/`) characters from the `metadata.name` field to avoid an "invalid resource name" error when you create the object.
<2> If you want the catalog source to be available globally to users in all namespaces, specify the `{namespace}` namespace. Otherwise, you can specify a different namespace for the catalog to be scoped and available only for that namespace.
<3> Specify the value of `legacy` or `restricted`. If the field is not set, the default value is `legacy`. In a future {product-title} release, it is planned that the default value will be `restricted`. If your catalog cannot run with `restricted` permissions, it is recommended that you manually set this field to `legacy`.
<4> Specify your index image. If you specify a tag after the image name, for example `:{tag}`, the catalog source pod uses an image pull policy of `Always`, meaning the pod always pulls the image prior to starting the container. If you specify a digest, for example `@sha256:<id>`, the image pull policy is `IfNotPresent`, meaning the pod pulls the image only if it does not already exist on the node.
<5> Specify your name or an organization name publishing the catalog.
<6> Catalog sources can automatically check for new versions to keep up to date.

.. Use the file to create the `CatalogSource` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f catalogSource.yaml

[id="olm-installing-operators-from-operatorhub_{context}"]
= About Operator installation with OperatorHub

OperatorHub is a user interface for discovering Operators; it works in conjunction with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which installs and manages Operators on a cluster.

As a cluster administrator, you can install an Operator from OperatorHub by using the {product-title}
web console or CLI. Subscribing an Operator to one or more namespaces makes the Operator available to developers on your cluster.



During installation, you must determine the following initial settings for the Operator:

Installation Mode:: Choose *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* to have the Operator installed on all namespaces or choose individual namespaces, if available, to only install the Operator on selected namespaces. This example chooses *All namespaces...* to make the Operator available to all users and projects.


Update Channel:: If an Operator is available through multiple channels, you can choose which channel you want to subscribe to. For example, to deploy from the *stable* channel, if available, select it from the list.

Approval Strategy:: You can choose automatic or manual updates.
+
If you choose automatic updates for an installed Operator, when a new version of that Operator is available in the selected channel, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention.
+
If you select manual updates, when a newer version of an Operator is available, OLM creates an update request. As a
cluster administrator,
you must then manually approve that update request to have the Operator updated to the new version.

[id="olm-installing-from-operatorhub-using-web-console_{context}"]
= Installing from OperatorHub using the web console

You can install and subscribe to an Operator from OperatorHub by using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

* Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with
`cluster-admin` permissions.


.Procedure

. Navigate in the web console to the *Operators → OperatorHub* page.

. Scroll or type a keyword into the *Filter by keyword* box to find the Operator you want. For example, type `{filter-type}` to find the {filter-operator} Operator.
+
You can also filter options by *Infrastructure Features*. For example, select *Disconnected* if you want to see Operators that work in disconnected environments, also known as restricted network environments.

. Select the Operator to display additional information.
+
[NOTE]
====
Choosing a Community Operator warns that Red Hat does not certify Community Operators; you must acknowledge the warning before continuing.
====

. Read the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:

.. Select one of the following:
*** *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster. This option is not always available.
*** *A specific namespace on the cluster* allows you to choose a specific, single namespace in which to install the Operator. The Operator will only watch and be made available for use in this single namespace.
.. If the cluster is in AWS STS mode, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS IAM role of your service account in the *role ARN* field.
+
image::oadp-install-operator-role-arn.png[Entering the ARN]
To create the role's ARN, follow the procedure described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/tutorials/cloud-experts-deploy-api-data-protection#prepare-aws-account_cloud-experts-deploy-api-data-protection[Preparing AWS account].

.. If more than one update channel is available, select an *Update channel*.

.. Select *Automatic* or *Manual* approval strategy, as described earlier.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the web console shows that the cluster is in "STS mode", you must set *Update approval* to *Manual*.

Subscriptions with automatic update approvals are not recommended because there might be permission changes to make prior to updating. Subscriptions with manual update approvals ensure that administrators have the opportunity to verify the permissions of the later version and take any necessary steps prior to update.
====

. Click *Install* to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces on this {product-title} cluster.

.. If you selected a *Manual* approval strategy, the upgrade status of the subscription remains *Upgrading* until you review and approve the install plan.
+
After approving on the *Install Plan* page, the subscription upgrade status moves to *Up to date*.

.. If you selected an *Automatic* approval strategy, the upgrade status should resolve to *Up to date* without intervention.

. After the upgrade status of the subscription is *Up to date*, select *Operators → Installed Operators* to verify that the cluster service version (CSV) of the installed Operator eventually shows up. The *Status* should ultimately resolve to *InstallSucceeded* in the relevant namespace.
+
[NOTE]
====
For the *All namespaces...* installation mode, the status resolves to *InstallSucceeded* in the `openshift-operators` namespace, but the status is *Copied* if you check in other namespaces.
====
+
If it does not:

.. Check the logs in any pods in the `openshift-operators` project (or other relevant namespace if *A specific namespace...* installation mode was selected) on the *Workloads → Pods* page that are reporting issues to troubleshoot further.

[id="olm-installing-operator-from-operatorhub-using-cli_{context}"]
= Installing from OperatorHub using the CLI

Instead of using the {product-title} web console, you can install an Operator from OperatorHub by using the CLI. Use the `oc` command to create or update a `Subscription` object.

.Prerequisites

- Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with
`cluster-admin` permissions.


- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. View the list of Operators available to the cluster from OperatorHub:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

kubefed                            Community Operators   91m
...
----
+
Note the catalog for your desired Operator.

. Inspect your desired Operator to verify its supported install modes and available channels:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe packagemanifests <operator_name> -n openshift-marketplace
----

. An Operator group, defined by an `OperatorGroup` object, selects target namespaces in which to generate required RBAC access for all Operators in the same namespace as the Operator group.
+
The namespace to which you subscribe the Operator must have an Operator group that matches the install mode of the Operator, either the `AllNamespaces` or `SingleNamespace` mode. If the Operator you intend to install uses the `AllNamespaces`, then the `openshift-operators` namespace already has an appropriate Operator group in place.
+
However, if the Operator uses the `SingleNamespace` mode and you do not already have an appropriate Operator group in place, you must create one.
+
[NOTE]
====
The web console version of this procedure handles the creation of the `OperatorGroup` and `Subscription` objects automatically behind the scenes for you when choosing `SingleNamespace` mode.
====

.. Create an `OperatorGroup` object YAML file, for example `operatorgroup.yaml`:
+
.Example `OperatorGroup` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: <operatorgroup_name>

spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - <namespace>
----

.. Create the `OperatorGroup` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f operatorgroup.yaml
----

. Create a `Subscription` object YAML file to subscribe a namespace to an Operator, for example `sub.yaml`:
+
.Example `Subscription` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription

      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
    nodeSelector: <12>
      foo: bar
----
<1> For default `AllNamespaces` install mode usage, specify the `openshift-operators` namespace. Alternatively, you can specify a custom global namespace, if you have created one. Otherwise, specify the relevant single namespace for `SingleNamespace` install mode usage.
<2> Name of the channel to subscribe to.
<3> Name of the Operator to subscribe to.
<4> Name of the catalog source that provides the Operator.
<5> Namespace of the catalog source. Use `openshift-marketplace` for the default OperatorHub catalog sources.
<6> The `env` parameter defines a list of Environment Variables that must exist in all containers in the pod created by OLM.
<7> The `envFrom` parameter defines a list of sources to populate Environment Variables in the container.
<8> The `volumes` parameter defines a list of Volumes that must exist on the pod created by OLM.
<9> The `volumeMounts` parameter defines a list of volume mounts that must exist in all containers in the pod created by OLM. If a `volumeMount` references a `volume` that does not exist, OLM fails to deploy the Operator.
<10> The `tolerations` parameter defines a list of Tolerations for the pod created by OLM.
<11> The `resources` parameter defines resource constraints for all the containers in the pod created by OLM.
<12> The `nodeSelector` parameter defines a `NodeSelector` for the pod created by OLM.

. If the cluster is in STS mode, include the following fields in the `Subscription` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: Subscription
# ...
spec:
  installPlanApproval: Manual <1>
  config:
    env:
    - name: ROLEARN
      value: "<role_arn>" <2>
----
<1> Subscriptions with automatic update approvals are not recommended because there might be permission changes to make prior to updating. Subscriptions with manual update approvals ensure that administrators have the opportunity to verify the permissions of the later version and take any necessary steps prior to update.
<2> Include the role ARN details.

. Create the `Subscription` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f sub.yaml
----
+
At this point, OLM is now aware of the selected Operator. A cluster service version (CSV) for the Operator should appear in the target namespace, and APIs provided by the Operator should be available for creation.

In {product-title}, an alert is fired when the conditions defined in an alerting rule are true. An alert provides a notification that a set of circumstances are apparent within a cluster. Firing alerts can be viewed in the Alerting UI in the {product-title} web console by default. After an installation, you can configure {product-title} to send alert notifications to external systems.

[id="sending-notifications-to-external-systems_{context}"]
= Sending notifications to external systems

In {product-title} {product-version}, firing alerts can be viewed in the Alerting UI. Alerts are not configured by default to be sent to any notification systems. You can configure {product-title} to send alerts to the following receiver types:

* PagerDuty
* Webhook
* Email
* Slack

Routing alerts to receivers enables you to send timely notifications to the appropriate teams when failures occur. For example, critical alerts require immediate attention and are typically paged to an individual or a critical response team. Alerts that provide non-critical warning notifications might instead be routed to a ticketing system for non-immediate review.

.Checking that alerting is operational by using the watchdog alert

{product-title} monitoring includes a watchdog alert that fires continuously. Alertmanager repeatedly sends watchdog alert notifications to configured notification providers. The provider is usually configured to notify an administrator when it stops receiving the watchdog alert. This mechanism helps you quickly identify any communication issues between Alertmanager and the notification provider.

[id="configuring-alert-receivers_{context}"]
= Configuring alert receivers

You can configure alert receivers to ensure that you learn about important issues with your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings* -> *Configuration* -> *Alertmanager*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can navigate to the same page through the notification drawer. Select the bell icon at the top right of the {product-title} web console and choose *Configure* in the *AlertmanagerReceiverNotConfigured* alert.
====

. Select *Create Receiver* in the *Receivers* section of the page.

. In the *Create Receiver* form, add a *Receiver Name* and choose a *Receiver Type* from the list.

. Edit the receiver configuration:
+
* For PagerDuty receivers:
+
.. Choose an integration type and add a PagerDuty integration key.
+
.. Add the URL of your PagerDuty installation.
+
.. Select *Show advanced configuration* if you want to edit the client and incident details or the severity specification.
+
* For webhook receivers:
+
.. Add the endpoint to send HTTP POST requests to.
+
.. Select *Show advanced configuration* if you want to edit the default option to send resolved alerts to the receiver.
+
* For email receivers:
+
.. Add the email address to send notifications to.
+
.. Add SMTP configuration details, including the address to send notifications from, the smarthost and port number used for sending emails, the hostname of the SMTP server, and authentication details.
+
.. Choose whether TLS is required.
+
.. Select *Show advanced configuration* if you want to edit the default option not to send resolved alerts to the receiver or edit the body of email notifications configuration.
+
* For Slack receivers:
+
.. Add the URL of the Slack webhook.
+
.. Add the Slack channel or user name to send notifications to.
+
.. Select *Show advanced configuration* if you want to edit the default option not to send resolved alerts to the receiver or edit the icon and username configuration. You can also choose whether to find and link channel names and usernames.

. By default, firing alerts with labels that match all of the selectors will be sent to the receiver. If you want label values for firing alerts to be matched exactly before they are sent to the receiver:
.. Add routing label names and values in the *Routing Labels* section of the form.
+
.. Select *Regular Expression* if want to use a regular expression.
+
.. Select *Add Label* to add further routing labels.

. Select *Create* to create the receiver.

There might be some scenarios where you need to convert your {product-title} cluster from a connected cluster to a disconnected cluster.

A disconnected cluster, also known as a restricted cluster, does not have an active connection to the internet. As such, you must mirror the contents of your registries and installation media. You can create this mirror registry on a host that can access both the internet and your closed network, or copy images to a device that you can move across network boundaries.

This topic describes the general process for converting an existing, connected cluster into a disconnected cluster.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="installation-about-mirror-registry_{context}"]
= About the mirror registry

You can mirror the images that are required for {product-title} installation and subsequent product updates to a container mirror registry such as Red Hat Quay, JFrog Artifactory, Sonatype Nexus Repository, or Harbor. If you do not have access to a large-scale container registry, you can use the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_, a small-scale container registry included with {product-title} subscriptions.

You can use any container registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2[Docker v2-2], such as Red Hat Quay, the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_, Artifactory, Sonatype Nexus Repository, or Harbor. Regardless of your chosen registry, the procedure to mirror content from Red Hat hosted sites on the internet to an isolated image registry is the same. After you mirror the content, you configure each cluster to retrieve this content from your mirror registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {product-registry} cannot be used as the target registry because it does not support pushing without a tag, which is required during the mirroring process.
====

If choosing a container registry that is not the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_, it must be reachable by every machine in the clusters that you provision. If the registry is unreachable, installation, updating, or normal operations such as workload relocation might fail. For that reason, you must run mirror registries in a highly available way, and the mirror registries must at least match the production availability of your {product-title} clusters.

When you populate your mirror registry with {product-title} images, you can follow two scenarios. If you have a host that can access both the internet and your mirror registry, but not your cluster nodes, you can directly mirror the content from that machine. This process is referred to as _connected mirroring_. If you have no such host, you must mirror the images to a file system and then bring that host or removable media into your restricted environment. This process is referred to as _disconnected mirroring_.

For mirrored registries, to view the source of pulled images, you must review the `Trying to access` log entry in the CRI-O logs. Other methods to view the image pull source, such as using the `crictl images` command on a node, show the non-mirrored image name, even though the image is pulled from the mirrored location.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not test third party registries with {product-title}.

== Prerequisites

* The `oc` client is installed.

* A running cluster.

* An installed mirror registry, which is a container image registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2] in the location that will host the {product-title} cluster, such as one of the following registries:

If you have an subscription to Red Hat Quay, see the documentation on deploying Red Hat Quay link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/deploy_red_hat_quay_for_proof-of-concept_non-production_purposes/[for proof-of-concept purposes] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index[by using the Quay Operator].

* The mirror repository must be configured to share images. For example, a Red Hat Quay repository requires link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/use_red_hat_quay/index#user-org-intro_use-quay[Organizations] in order to share images.

* Access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.

[id="connected-to-disconnected-prepare-mirror_{context}"]
= Preparing the cluster for mirroring

Before disconnecting your cluster, you must mirror, or copy, the images to a mirror registry that is reachable by every node in your disconnected cluster. In order to mirror the images, you must prepare your cluster by:

* Adding the mirror registry certificates to the list of trusted CAs on your host.
* Creating a `.dockerconfigjson` file that contains your image pull secret, which is from the `cloud.openshift.com` token.

.Procedure

. Configuring credentials that allow image mirroring:

.. Add the CA certificate for the mirror registry, in the simple PEM or DER file formats, to the list of trusted CAs. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cp </path/to/cert.crt> /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/anchors/
----
+
--
where::
+
`</path/to/cert.crt>`:: Specifies the path to the certificate on your local file system.
--

.. Update the CA trust. For example, in Linux:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ update-ca-trust
----

.. Extract the `.dockerconfigjson` file from the global pull secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc extract secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --confirm --to=.
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
.dockerconfigjson
----

.. Edit the `.dockerconfigjson` file to add your mirror registry and authentication credentials and save it as a new file:
// copied from olm-accessing-images-private-registries
+
[source,terminal]
----
{"auths":{"<local_registry>": {"auth": "<credentials>","email": "you@example.com"}}},"<registry>:<port>/<namespace>/":{"auth":"<token>"}}}
----
+
where:
+
`<local_registry>`:: Specifies the registry domain name, and optionally the port, that your mirror registry uses to serve content.
`auth`:: Specifies the base64-encoded user name and password for your mirror registry.
`<registry>:<port>/<namespace>`:: Specifies the mirror registry details.
`<token>`:: Specifies  the base64-encoded `username:password` for your mirror registry.
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ {"auths":{"cloud.openshift.com":{"auth":"b3BlbnNoaWZ0Y3UjhGOVZPT0lOMEFaUjdPUzRGTA==","email":"user@example.com"},

[id="connected-to-disconnected-config-registry_{context}"]
= Configuring the cluster for the mirror registry

After creating and mirroring the images to the mirror registry, you must modify your cluster so that pods can pull images from the mirror registry.

You must:

* Add the mirror registry credentials to the global pull secret.
* Add the mirror registry server certificate to the cluster.
* Create an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` custom resource (ICSP), which associates the mirror registry with the source registry.



. Add mirror registry credential to the cluster global pull-secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<pull_secret_location> <1>
----
<1> Provide the path to the new pull secret file.
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=.mirrorsecretconfigjson
----

. Add the CA-signed mirror registry server certificate to the nodes in the cluster:

.. Create a config map that includes the server certificate for the mirror registry
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap <config_map_name> --from-file=<mirror_address_host>..<port>=$path/ca.crt -n openshift-config
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
S oc create configmap registry-config --from-file=mirror.registry.com..443=/root/certs/ca-chain.cert.pem -n openshift-config
----

.. Use the config map to update the `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` custom resource (CR). {product-title} applies the changes to this CR to all nodes in the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch image.config.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"additionalTrustedCA":{"name":"<config_map_name>"}}}' --type=merge
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch image.config.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"additionalTrustedCA":{"name":"registry-config"}}}' --type=merge
----

. Create an ICSP to redirect container pull requests from the online registries to the mirror registry:

.. Create the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` custom resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageContentSourcePolicy
metadata:
  name: mirror-ocp
spec:
  repositoryDigestMirrors:
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.registry.com:443/ocp/release <1>
    source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release <2>
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.registry.com:443/ocp/release
    source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev
----
<1> Specifies the name of the mirror image registry and repository.
<2> Specifies the online registry and repository containing the content that is mirrored.

.. Create the ICSP object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f registryrepomirror.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
imagecontentsourcepolicy.operator.openshift.io/mirror-ocp created
----
+
{product-title} applies the changes to this CR to all nodes in the cluster.

. Verify that the credentials, CA, and ICSP for mirror registry were added:

.. Log into a node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----

.. Set `/host` as the root directory within the debug shell:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# chroot /host
----

.. Check the `config.json` file for the credentials:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.json
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
{"auths":{"brew.registry.redhat.io":{"xx=="},"brewregistry.stage.redhat.io":{"auth":"xxx=="},"mirror.registry.com:443":{"auth":"xx="}}} <1>
----
<1> Ensure that the mirror registry and credentials are present.

.. Change to the `certs.d` directory
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# cd /etc/docker/certs.d/
----

.. List the certificates in the `certs.d` directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# ls
----
+
.Example output
----
image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc.cluster.local:5000
image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000
mirror.registry.com:443 <1>
----
<1> Ensure that the mirror registry is in the list.

.. Check that the ICSP added the mirror registry to the `registries.conf` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# cat /etc/containers/registries.conf
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"]

= Restoring a degraded Insights Operator

Disconnecting the cluster from the network necessarily causes the cluster to lose the Internet connection. The Insights Operator becomes degraded because it requires access to link:https://console.redhat.com[Red Hat Insights].

This topic describes how to recover from a degraded Insights Operator.

.Procedure

. Edit your `.dockerconfigjson` file to remove the `cloud.openshift.com` entry, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
"cloud.openshift.com":{"auth":"<hash>","email":"user@example.com"}
----

. Save the file.

. Update the cluster secret with the edited `.dockerconfigjson` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=./.dockerconfigjson
----

. Verify that the Insights Operator is no longer degraded:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get co insights

|Value|Description

|`vCurrent`
|Specify this option when you want to automatically add new, default capabilities that are introduced in new releases.

|`v4.11`
|Specify this option when you want to enable the default capabilities for {product-title} 4.11. By specifying `v4.11`, capabilities that are introduced in newer versions of {product-title} are not enabled. The default capabilities in {product-title} 4.11 are `baremetal`, `MachineAPI`, `marketplace`, and `openshift-samples`.

|`v4.12`
|Specify this option when you want to enable the default capabilities for {product-title} 4.12. By specifying `v4.12`, capabilities that are introduced in newer versions of {product-title} are not enabled.

= Enabling the cluster capabilities by setting additional enabled capabilities

As a cluster administrator, you can enable the cluster capabilities by setting `additionalEnabledCapabilities`.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. View the additional enabled capabilities by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion version -o jsonpath='{.spec.capabilities.additionalEnabledCapabilities}{"\n"}'
----

+
.Example output

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch clusterversion/version --type merge -p '{"spec":{"capabilities":{"additionalEnabledCapabilities":["openshift-samples", "marketplace"]}}}'
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not possible to disable a capability which is already enabled in a cluster. The cluster version Operator (CVO) continues to reconcile the capability which is already enabled in the cluster.
====


If you try to disable a capability, then CVO shows the divergent spec:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion version -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="ImplicitlyEnabledCapabilities")]}{"\n"}'
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
{"lastTransitionTime":"2022-07-22T03:14:35Z","message":"The following capabilities could not be disabled: openshift-samples","reason":"CapabilitiesImplicitlyEnabled","status":"True","type":"ImplicitlyEnabledCapabilities"}
----

[NOTE]
====
During the cluster upgrades, it is possible that a given capability could be implicitly enabled. If a resource was already running on the cluster before the upgrade, then any capabilities that is part of the resource will be enabled. For example, during a cluster upgrade, a resource that is already running on the cluster has been changed to be part of the `marketplace` capability by the system. Even if a cluster administrator does not explicitly enabled the `marketplace` capability, it is implicitly enabled by the system.

toc::[]

After installing {product-title}, you can configure additional devices for your cluster in an {ibm-z-name} or {ibm-linuxone-name} environment, which is installed with z/VM. The following devices can be configured:

* Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) host
* FCP LUN
* DASD
* qeth

You can configure devices by adding udev rules using the Machine Config Operator (MCO) or you can configure devices manually.

[NOTE]
====
The procedures described here apply only to z/VM installations. If you have installed your cluster with {op-system-base} KVM on {ibm-z-name} or {ibm-linuxone-name} infrastructure, no additional configuration is needed inside the KVM guest after the devices were added to the KVM guests. However, both in z/VM and {op-system-base} KVM environments the next steps to configure the Local Storage Operator and Kubernetes NMState Operator need to be applied.

= Configuring additional devices using the Machine Config Operator (MCO)

Tasks in this section describe how to use features of the Machine Config Operator (MCO) to configure additional devices in an {ibm-z-name} or {ibm-linuxone-name} environment. Configuring devices with the MCO is persistent but only allows specific configurations for compute nodes. MCO does not allow control plane nodes to have different configurations.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.
* The device must be available to the z/VM guest.
* The device is already attached.
* The device is not included in the `cio_ignore` list, which can be set in the kernel parameters.
* You have created a `MachineConfig` object file with the following YAML:

toc::[]

As an administrator, you can specify multiple regions and zones for your {product-title} cluster that runs on a VMware vSphere instance. This configuration reduces the risk of a hardware failure or network outage causing your cluster to fail.

A failure domain configuration lists parameters that create a topology. The following list states some of these parameters:

* `computeCluster`

* `datacenter`

* `datastore`

* `networks`

* `resourcePool`

After you define multiple regions and zones for your {product-title} cluster, you can create or migrate nodes to another failure domain.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you want to migrate pre-existing {product-title} cluster compute nodes to a failure domain, you must define a new compute machine set for the compute node. This new machine set can scale up a compute node according to the topology of the failure domain, and scale down the pre-existing compute node.

The cloud provider adds `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` and `topology.kubernetes.io/region` labels to any compute node provisioned by a machine set resource.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/machine_management/#[Creating a compute machine set].

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="specifying-regions-zones-infrastructure-vsphere_{context}"]
= Specifying multiple regions and zones for your cluster on vSphere

You can configure the `infrastructures.config.openshift.io` configuration resource to specify multiple regions and zones for your {product-title} cluster that runs on a VMware vSphere instance.

Topology-aware features for the cloud controller manager and the vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) Operator Driver require information about the vSphere topology where you host your {product-title} cluster. This topology information exists in the `infrastructures.config.openshift.io` configuration resource.

Before you specify regions and zones for your cluster, you must ensure that all datacenters and compute clusters contain tags, so that the cloud provider can add labels to your node. For example, if `datacenter-1` represents `region-a` and `compute-cluster-1` represents `zone-1`, the cloud provider adds an `openshift-region` category label with a value of `region-a` to `datacenter-1`.  Additionally, the cloud provider adds an `openshift-zone` category tag with a value of `zone-1` to `compute-cluster-1`.

[NOTE]
====
You can migrate control plane nodes with vMotion capabilities to a failure domain. After you add these nodes to a failure domain, the cloud provider adds `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` and `topology.kubernetes.io/region` labels to these nodes.
====

.Prerequisites
* You created the `openshift-region` and `openshift-zone` tag categories on the vCenter server.
* You ensured that each datacenter and compute cluster contains tags that represent the name of their associated region or zone, or both.
* Optional: If you defined *API* and *Ingress* static IP addresses to the installation program, you must ensure that all regions and zones share a common layer 2 network. This configuration ensures that API and Ingress Virtual IP (VIP) addresses can interact with your cluster.

// Add link(s) that points to Day-0 docs for creating tags as soon as the Day-0 content is merged.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not supply tags to all datacenters and compute clusters before you create a node or migrate a node, the cloud provider cannot add the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` and `topology.kubernetes.io/region` labels to the node. This means that services cannot route traffic to your node.
====

.Procedure

. Edit the `infrastructures.config.openshift.io` custom resource definition (CRD) of your cluster to specify multiple regions and zones in the `failureDomains` section of the resource by running the following command:

= Enabling a multiple layer 2 network for your cluster

You can configure your cluster to use a multiple layer 2 network configuration so that data transfer among nodes can span across multiple networks.

.Prerequisites
* You configured network connectivity among machines so that cluster components can communicate with each other.

.Procedure
* If you installed your cluster with installer-provisioned infrastructure, you must ensure that all control plane nodes share a common layer 2 network. Additionally, ensure compute nodes that are configured for Ingress pod scheduling share a common layer 2 network.

** If you need compute nodes to span multiple layer 2 networks, you can create infrastructure nodes that can host Ingress pods.
** If you need to provision workloads across additional layer 2 networks, you can create compute machine sets on vSphere and then move these workloads to your target layer 2 networks.

* If you installed your cluster on infrastructure that you provided, which is defined as a user-provisioned infrastructure, complete the following actions to meet your needs:
** Configure your API load balancer and network so that the load balancer can reach the API and Machine Config Server on the control plane nodes.
** Configure your Ingress load balancer and network so that the load balancer can reach the Ingress pods on the compute or infrastructure nodes.

{op-system-first} image layering allows you to easily extend the functionality of your base {op-system} image by _layering_ additional images onto the base image. This layering does not modify the base {op-system} image. Instead, it creates a _custom layered image_ that includes all {op-system} functionality and adds additional functionality to specific nodes in the cluster.

You create a custom layered image by using a Containerfile and applying it to nodes by using a `MachineConfig` object. The Machine Config Operator overrides the base {op-system} image, as specified by the `osImageURL` value in the associated machine config, and boots the new image. You can remove the custom layered image by deleting the machine config, The MCO reboots the nodes back to the base {op-system} image.

With {op-system} image layering, you can install RPMs into your base image, and your custom content will be booted alongside {op-system}. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) can roll out these custom layered images and monitor these custom containers in the same way it does for the default {op-system} image. {op-system} image layering gives you greater flexibility in how you manage your {op-system} nodes.

// NOTE from https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2214?focusedCommentId=21430101&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-21430101

[IMPORTANT]
====
Installing realtime kernel and extensions RPMs as custom layered content is not recommended. This is because these RPMs can conflict with RPMs installed by using a machine config. If there is a conflict, the MCO enters a `degraded` state when it tries to install the machine config RPM. You need to remove the conflicting extension from your machine config before proceeding.
====

As soon as you apply the custom layered image to your cluster, you effectively _take ownership_ of your custom layered images and those nodes. While Red Hat remains responsible for maintaining and updating the base {op-system} image on standard nodes, you are responsible for maintaining and updating images on nodes that use a custom layered image. You assume the responsibility for the package you applied with the custom layered image and any issues that might arise with the package.

To apply a custom layered image, you create a Containerfile that references an {product-title} image and the RPM that you want to apply. You then push the resulting custom layered image to an image registry. In a non-production {product-title} cluster, create a `MachineConfig` object for the targeted node pool that points to the new image.

[NOTE]
====
Use the same base {op-system} image installed on the rest of your cluster. Use the `oc adm release info --image-for rhel-coreos` command to obtain the base image used in your cluster.
====

{op-system} image layering allows you to use the following types of images to create custom layered images:

* *{product-title} Hotfixes*. You can work with Customer Experience and Engagement (CEE) to obtain and apply link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2996001[Hotfix packages] on top of your {op-system} image. In some instances, you might want a bug fix or enhancement before it is included in an official {product-title} release. {op-system} image layering allows you to easily add the Hotfix before it is officially released and remove the Hotfix when the underlying {op-system} image incorporates the fix.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Some Hotfixes require a Red Hat Support Exception and are outside of the normal scope of {product-title} support coverage or life cycle policies.
====
+
In the event you want a Hotfix, it will be provided to you based on link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2996001[Red Hat Hotfix policy]. Apply it on top of the base image and test that new custom layered image in a non-production environment. When you are satisfied that the custom layered image is safe to use in production, you can roll it out on your own schedule to specific node pools. For any reason, you can easily roll back the custom layered image and return to using the default {op-system}.

+
--
** Bleeding edge drivers and kernel enhancements to improve performance or add capabilities.
** Forensic client tools to investigate possible and actual break-ins.
** Security agents.
** Inventory agents that provide a coherent view of the entire cluster.
** SSH Key management packages.

+
This Containerfile installs the Linux fish program. Because fish requires additional RHEL packages, the image must be built on an entitled {op-system-base} host.

After you create the machine config, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) performs the following steps:

. Renders a new machine config for the specified pool or pools.
. Performs cordon and drain operations on the nodes in the pool or pools.
. Writes the rest of the machine config parameters onto the nodes.
. Applies the custom layered image to the node.
. Reboots the node using the new image.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is strongly recommended that you test your images outside of your production environment before rolling out to your cluster.

[id="coreos-layering-configuring_{context}"]
= Applying a {op-system} custom layered image

You can easily configure {op-system-first} image layering on the nodes in specific machine config pools. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) reboots those nodes with the new custom layered image, overriding the base {op-system-first} image.

To apply a custom layered image to your cluster, you must have the custom layered image in a repository that your cluster can access. Then, create a `MachineConfig` object that points to the custom layered image. You need a separate `MachineConfig` object for each machine config pool that you want to configure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you configure a custom layered image, {product-title} no longer automatically updates any node that uses the custom layered image. You become responsible for manually updating your nodes as appropriate. If you roll back the custom layer, {product-title} will again automatically update the node. See the Additional resources section that follows for important information about updating nodes that use a custom layered image.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must create a custom layered image that is based on an {product-title} image digest, not a tag.
+
[NOTE]
====
You should use the same base {op-system} image that is installed on the rest of your cluster. Use the `oc adm release info --image-for rhel-coreos` command to obtain the base image being used in your cluster.
====
+
For example, the following Containerfile creates a custom layered image from an {product-title} {product-version} image and overrides the kernel package with one from CentOS 9 Stream:
+

----
<1> Specifies the {op-system} base image of your cluster.
<2> Enables `cliwrap`. This is currently required to intercept some command invocations made from kernel scripts.
<3> Replaces the kernel packages.
+
[NOTE]
====
Instructions on how to create a Containerfile are beyond the scope of this documentation.
====

* Because the process for building a custom layered image is performed outside of the cluster, you must use the `--authfile /path/to/pull-secret` option with Podman or Buildah. Alternatively, to have the pull secret read by these tools automatically, you can add it to one of the default file locations: `~/.docker/config.json`, `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json`, `~/.docker/config.json`, or `~/.dockercfg`. Refer to the `containers-auth.json` man page for more information.

* You must push the custom layered image to a repository that your cluster can access.

.Procedure

. Create a machine config file.

.. Create a YAML file similar to the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker <1>
  name: os-layer-custom
spec:
  osImageURL: quay.io/my-registry/custom-image@sha256... <2>
----
<1> Specifies the machine config pool to apply the custom layered image.
<2> Specifies the path to the custom layered image in the repository.

.. Create the `MachineConfig` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is strongly recommended that you test your images outside of your production environment before rolling out to your cluster.
====

.Verification

You can verify that the custom layered image is applied by performing any of the following checks:

. Check that the worker machine config pool has rolled out with the new machine config:

.. Check that the new machine config is created:

= Removing a {op-system} custom layered image

You can easily revert {op-system-first} image layering from the nodes in specific machine config pools. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) reboots those nodes with the cluster base {op-system-first} image, overriding the custom layered image.

To remove a {op-system-first} custom layered image from your cluster, you need to delete the machine config that applied the image.

.Procedure

. Delete the machine config that applied the custom layered image.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete mc os-layer-custom
----
+
After deleting the machine config, the nodes reboot.

.Verification

You can verify that the custom layered image is removed by performing any of the following checks:

. Check that the worker machine config pool is updating with the previous machine config:

= Updating with a {op-system} custom layered image

When you configure {op-system-first} image layering, {product-title} no longer automatically updates the node pool that uses the custom layered image. You become responsible to manually update your nodes as appropriate.

To update a node that uses a custom layered image, follow these general steps:

. The cluster automatically upgrades to version x.y.z+1, except for the nodes that use the custom layered image.

. You could then create a new Containerfile that references the updated {product-title} image and the RPM that you had previously applied.

. Create a new machine config that points to the updated custom layered image.

Updating a node with a custom layered image is not required. However, if that node gets too far behind the current {product-title} version, you could experience unexpected results.

= Extend existing clusters to use AWS Local Zones

As a postinstallation task, you can extend an existing {product-title} cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to use AWS Local Zones.

Extending nodes to Local Zone locations comprises the following steps:

- Adjusting the cluster-network maximum transmission unit (MTU)
- Opting in the Local Zone group to AWS Local Zones
- Creating a subnet in the existing VPC for a Local Zone location
- Creating the machine set manifest, and then creating a node in each Local Zone location

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you extend an existing {product-title} cluster on AWS to use Local Zones, check that the existing VPC contains available Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks. These blocks are needed for creating the subnets.

= Edge compute pools and AWS Local Zones

Edge worker nodes are tainted worker nodes that run in AWS Local Zones locations.

When deploying a cluster that uses Local Zones, consider the following points:

* Amazon EC2 instances in the Local Zones are more expensive than Amazon EC2 instances in the Availability Zones.
* Latency between applications and end users is lower in Local Zones, and latency might vary by location. A latency impact exists for some workloads if, for example, ingress traffic is mixed between Local Zones and Availability Zones.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Generally, the maximum transmission unit (MTU) between an Amazon EC2 instance in a Local Zone and an Amazon EC2 instance in the Region is 1300. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/local-zones/latest/ug/how-local-zones-work.html[How Local Zones work] in the AWS documentation.
The cluster network MTU must be always less than the EC2 MTU to account for the overhead. The specific overhead is determined by the network plugin, for example:

- OVN-Kubernetes: `100 bytes`
- OpenShift SDN: `50 bytes`

The network plugin can provide additional features, like IPsec, that also must be decreased the MTU. For additional information, see the documentation.
====

{product-title} 4.12 introduced a new compute pool, _edge_, that is designed for use in remote zones. The edge compute pool configuration is common between AWS Local Zones locations. Because of the type and size limitations of resources like EC2 and EBS on Local Zone resources, the default instance type can vary from the traditional worker pool.

The default Elastic Block Store (EBS) for Local Zone locations is `gp2`, which differs from the regular worker pool. The instance type used for each Local Zone on edge compute pool also might differ from worker pools, depending on the instance offerings on the zone.

The edge compute pool creates new labels that developers can use to deploy applications onto AWS Local Zones nodes. The new labels are:

* `node-role.kubernetes.io/edge=''`
* `machine.openshift.io/zone-type=local-zone`
* `machine.openshift.io/zone-group=$ZONE_GROUP_NAME`

////
By default, the system creates the edge compute pool manifests only if users add AWS Local Zones subnet IDs to the list `platform.aws.subnets`.
////

By default, the machine sets for the edge compute pool defines the taint of `NoSchedule` to prevent regular workloads from spreading on Local Zone instances. Users can only run user workloads if they define tolerations in the pod specification.

=== Changing the Cluster Network MTU to support AWS Local Zones subnets

You might need to change the maximum transmission unit (MTU) value for the cluster
network so that your cluster infrastructure can support Local Zone subnets.

// About the cluster MTU

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="nw-cluster-mtu-change-about_{context}"]
= About the cluster MTU

During installation the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the cluster network is detected automatically based on the MTU of the primary network interface of nodes in the cluster. You do not usually need to override the detected MTU.

You might want to change the MTU of the cluster network for several reasons:

* The MTU detected during cluster installation is not correct for your infrastructure.
* Your cluster infrastructure now requires a different MTU, such as from the addition of nodes that need a different MTU for optimal performance.

You can change the cluster MTU for only the OVN-Kubernetes and OpenShift SDN cluster network plugins.

// https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/network/allow-mtu-changes.md
[id="service-interruption-considerations_{context}"]
== Service interruption considerations

When you initiate an MTU change on your cluster the following effects might impact service availability:

* At least two rolling reboots are required to complete the migration to a new MTU. During this time, some nodes are not available as they restart.

* Specific applications deployed to the cluster with shorter timeout intervals than the absolute TCP timeout interval might experience disruption during the MTU change.

[id="mtu-value-selection_{context}"]
== MTU value selection

When planning your MTU migration there are two related but distinct MTU values to consider.

* *Hardware MTU*: This MTU value is set based on the specifics of your network infrastructure.
* *Cluster network MTU*: This MTU value is always less than your hardware MTU to account for the cluster network overlay overhead. The specific overhead is determined by your network plugin:
** *OVN-Kubernetes*: `100` bytes
** *OpenShift SDN*: `50` bytes

If your cluster requires different MTU values for different nodes, you must subtract the overhead value for your network plugin from the lowest MTU value that is used by any node in your cluster. For example, if some nodes in your cluster have an MTU of `9001`, and some have an MTU of `1500`, you must set this value to `1400`.

[id="how-the-migration-process-works_{context}"]
== How the migration process works

The following table summarizes the migration process by segmenting between the user-initiated steps in the process and the actions that the migration performs in response.

.Live migration of the cluster MTU
[cols="1a,1a",options="header"]
|===

|User-initiated steps|{product-title} activity

|
Set the following values in the Cluster Network Operator configuration:

- `spec.migration.mtu.machine.to`
- `spec.migration.mtu.network.from`
- `spec.migration.mtu.network.to`

|
*Cluster Network Operator (CNO)*: Confirms that each field is set to a valid value.

- The `mtu.machine.to` must be set to either the new hardware MTU or to the current hardware MTU if the MTU for the hardware is not changing. This value is transient and is used as part of the migration process. Separately, if you specify a hardware MTU that is different from your existing hardware MTU value, you must manually configure the MTU to persist by other means, such as with a machine config, DHCP setting, or a Linux kernel command line.
- The `mtu.network.from` field must equal the `network.status.clusterNetworkMTU` field, which is the current MTU of the cluster network.
- The `mtu.network.to` field must be set to the target cluster network MTU and must be lower than the hardware MTU to allow for the overlay overhead of the network plugin. For OVN-Kubernetes, the overhead is `100` bytes and for OpenShift SDN the overhead is `50` bytes.

If the values provided are valid, the CNO writes out a new temporary configuration with the MTU for the cluster network set to the value of the `mtu.network.to` field.

*Machine Config Operator (MCO)*: Performs a rolling reboot of each node in the cluster.

|Reconfigure the MTU of the primary network interface for the nodes on the cluster. You can use a variety of methods to accomplish this, including:

- Deploying a new NetworkManager connection profile with the MTU change
- Changing the MTU through a DHCP server setting
- Changing the MTU through boot parameters
|N/A

|Set the `mtu` value in the CNO configuration for the network plugin and set `spec.migration` to `null`.

= Changing the cluster MTU

As a cluster administrator, you can change the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for your cluster. The migration is disruptive and nodes in your cluster might be temporarily unavailable as the MTU update rolls out.


.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You identified the target MTU for your cluster. The correct MTU varies depending on the network plugin that your cluster uses:
** *OVN-Kubernetes*: The cluster MTU must be set to `100` less than the lowest hardware MTU value in your cluster.
** *OpenShift SDN*: The cluster MTU must be set to `50` less than the lowest hardware MTU value in your cluster.

.Procedure

To increase or decrease the MTU for the cluster network complete the following procedure.

. To obtain the current MTU for the cluster network, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe network.config cluster
----
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
...
Status:
  Cluster Network:
    Cidr:               10.217.0.0/22
    Host Prefix:        23
  Cluster Network MTU:  1400
  Network Type:         OpenShiftSDN
  Service Network:
    10.217.4.0/23
...
----


. To begin the MTU migration, specify the migration configuration by entering the following command. The Machine Config Operator performs a rolling reboot of the nodes in the cluster in preparation for the MTU change.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch Network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=merge --patch \
  '{"spec": { "migration": { "mtu": { "network": { "from": <overlay_from>, "to": <overlay_to> } , "machine": { "to" : <machine_to> } } } } }'
----
+
--
where:

`<overlay_from>`:: Specifies the current cluster network MTU value.
`<overlay_to>`:: Specifies the target MTU for the cluster network. This value is set relative to the value for `<machine_to>` and for OVN-Kubernetes must be `100` less and for OpenShift SDN must be `50` less.
`<machine_to>`:: Specifies the MTU for the primary network interface on the underlying host network.
--
+
.Example that increases the cluster MTU

$ oc patch Network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=merge --patch \
  '{"spec": { "migration": { "mtu": { "network": { "from": 1400, "to": 9000 } , "machine": { "to" : 9100} } } } }'
----

. As the MCO updates machines in each machine config pool, it reboots each node one by one. You must wait until all the nodes are updated. Check the machine config pool status by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mcp
----
+
A successfully updated node has the following status: `UPDATED=true`, `UPDATING=false`, `DEGRADED=false`.
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, the MCO updates one machine per pool at a time, causing the total time the migration takes to increase with the size of the cluster.
====

. Confirm the status of the new machine configuration on the hosts:

.. To list the machine configuration state and the name of the applied machine configuration, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node | egrep "hostname|machineconfig"

* The value of `machineconfiguration.openshift.io/state` field is `Done`.
* The value of the `machineconfiguration.openshift.io/currentConfig` field is equal to the value of the `machineconfiguration.openshift.io/desiredConfig` field.
--

.. To confirm that the machine config is correct, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfig <config_name> -o yaml | grep ExecStart
----
+
where `<config_name>` is the name of the machine config from the `machineconfiguration.openshift.io/currentConfig` field.
+
The machine config must include the following update to the systemd configuration:
+
[source,plain]
----
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/mtu-migration.sh
----


. To finalize the MTU migration, enter one of the following commands:
** If you are using the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin:
+
[source,terminal]
+
----
$ oc patch Network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=merge --patch \
  '{"spec": { "migration": null, "defaultNetwork":{ "ovnKubernetesConfig": { "mtu": <mtu> }}}}'
----

--
where:

`<mtu>`:: Specifies the new cluster network MTU that you specified with `<overlay_to>`.
--

** If you are using the OpenShift SDN network plugin:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch Network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=merge --patch \
  '{"spec": { "migration": null, "defaultNetwork":{ "openshiftSDNConfig": { "mtu": <mtu> }}}}'
----
+
--
where:

`<mtu>`:: Specifies the new cluster network MTU that you specified with `<overlay_to>`.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mcp
----
+
A successfully updated node has the following status: `UPDATED=true`, `UPDATING=false`, `DEGRADED=false`.

.Verification

* Verify that the node in your cluster uses the MTU that you specified in the previous procedure by entering the following command:

= Extend existing clusters to use AWS Local Zones

If you want a Machine API to create an Amazon EC2 instance in a remote zone location, you must create a subnet in a Local Zone location. You can use any provisioning tool, such as Ansible or Terraform, to create subnets in the existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). You can configure the CloudFormation template to meet your requirements.

The following subsections include steps that use CloudFormation templates. Considering the limitation of NAT Gateways in AWS Local Zones, CloudFormation templates support only public subnets. You can reuse the template to create public subnets for each edge location to where you need to extend your cluster.

= Creating a compute machine set

In addition to the compute machine sets created by the installation program, you can create your own to dynamically manage the machine compute resources for specific workloads of your choice.


.Prerequisites

* Deploy an {product-title} cluster.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in to `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. Create a new YAML file that contains the compute machine set custom resource (CR) sample and is named `<file_name>.yaml`.
+
Ensure that you set the `<clusterID>` and `<role>` parameter values.

. Optional: If you are not sure which value to set for a specific field, you can check an existing compute machine set from your cluster.

.. To list the compute machine sets in your cluster, run the following command:

= Creating user workloads in AWS Local Zones
After you create an Amazon Web Service (AWS) Local Zone environment, and you deploy your cluster, you can use edge worker nodes to create user workloads in Local Zone subnets.

After you run the installation program and create the cluster, the installation program automatically specifies a taint effect of `NoSchedule` to each edge worker node. This means that a scheduler does not add a new pod, or deployment, to a node if the pod does not match the specified tolerations for a taint. You can modify the taint for better control over how nodes create workloads in each Local Zone subnet.

The installation program creates the compute machine set manifests file with `node-role.kubernetes.io/edge` and `node-role.kubernetes.io/worker` labels applied to each edge worker node that is located in a Local Zone subnet.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You deployed your cluster in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with defined Local Zone subnets.
* You ensured that the compute machine set for the edge workers on Local Zone subnets specifies the taints for `node-role.kubernetes.io/edge`.

.Procedure

. Create a `deployment` resource YAML file for an example application to be deployed in the edge worker node that operates in a Local Zone subnet. Ensure that you specify the correct tolerations that match the taints for the edge worker node.

toc::[]

By default, the installation program installs control plane and compute machines into a single Nutanix Prism Element (cluster). After an {product-title} cluster is deployed, you can improve its fault tolerance by adding additional Prism Element instances to the deployment using failure domains.

A failure domain represents a single Prism Element instance to which:

* New control plane and compute machines can be deployed.
* Existing control plane and compute machines can be distributed.

= Failure domain requirements

When planning to use failure domains, consider the following requirements:

* All Nutanix Prism Element instances must be managed by the same instance of Prism Central. A deployment that is comprised of multiple Prism Central instances is not supported.
* The machines that make up the Prism Element clusters must reside on the same Ethernet network for failure domains to be able to communicate with each other.
* A subnet is required in each Prism Element that will be used as a failure domain in the {product-title} cluster. When defining these subnets, they must share the same IP address prefix (CIDR) and should contain the virtual IP addresses that the {product-title} cluster uses.

= Adding failure domains to the Infrastructure CR

You add failure domains to an existing Nutanix cluster by modifying its Infrastructure custom resource (CR) (`infrastructures.config.openshift.io`).

[TIP]
====
It is recommended that you configure three failure domains to ensure high-availability.
====

.Procedure

. Edit the Infrastructure CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit infrastructures.config.openshift.io cluster
----

. Configure the failure domains.

where:

`<uuid>`:: Specifies the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the Prism Element.
`<failure_domain_name>`:: Specifies a unique name for the failure domain. The name is limited to 64 or fewer characters, which can include lower-case letters, digits, and a dash (`-`). The dash cannot be in the leading or ending position of the name.
`<network_uuid>`:: Specifies the UUID of the Prism Element subnet object. The subnet's IP address prefix (CIDR) should contain the virtual IP addresses that the {product-title} cluster uses. Only one subnet per failure domain (Prism Element) in an {product-title} cluster is supported.

. Save the CR to apply the changes.

= Distributing control planes across failure domains

You distribute control planes across Nutanix failure domains by modifying the control plane machine set custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* You have configured the failure domains in the cluster's Infrastructure custom resource (CR).
* The control plane machine set custom resource (CR) is in an active state.

For more information on checking the control plane machine set custom resource state, see "Additional resources".

.Procedure

. Edit the control plane machine set CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit controlplanemachineset.machine.openshift.io cluster -n openshift-machine-api
----
. Configure the control plane machine set to use failure domains by adding a `spec.template.machines_v1beta1_machine_openshift_io.failureDomains` stanza.

. Save your changes.

By default, the control plane machine set propagates changes to your control plane configuration automatically. If the cluster is configured to use the `OnDelete` update strategy, you must replace your control planes manually. For more information, see "Additional resources".

= Distributing compute machines across failure domains

You can distribute compute machines across Nutanix failure domains by performing either of the following tasks:

* Modifying existing compute machine sets.
* Creating new compute machine sets.

The following procedure details how to distribute compute machines across failure domains by modifying existing compute machine sets. For more information on creating a compute machine set, see "Additional resources".

.Prerequisites

* You have configured the failure domains in the cluster's Infrastructure custom resource (CR).

.Procedure

. Run the following command to view the cluster's Infrastructure CR.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe infrastructures.config.openshift.io cluster
----
. For each failure domain (`platformSpec.nutanix.failureDomains`), note the cluster's UUID, name, and subnet object UUID. These values are required to add a failure domain to a compute machine set.
. List the compute machine sets in your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----
. Edit the first compute machine set by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset_name> -n openshift-machine-api
----
. Configure the compute machine set to use the first failure domain by adding the following to the `spec.template.spec.providerSpec.value` stanza:
+
[NOTE]
====
Be sure that the values you specify for the `cluster` and `subnets` fields match the values that were configured in the `failureDomains` stanza in the cluster's Infrastructure CR.

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate machine/<machine_name_original_1> \

----
$ oc scale --replicas=<twice_the_number_of_replicas> \// <1>
  machineset <machine_set_name> \
  -n openshift-machine-api

. List the machines that are managed by the updated compute machine set by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n openshift-machine-api machines -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset=<machine_set_name>
----
+
When the new machines are in the `Running` phase, you can scale the compute machine set to the original number of replicas.
. Scale the compute machine set to the original number of replicas by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=<original_number_of_replicas> \// <1>
  machineset <machine_set_name> \
  -n openshift-machine-api
----
<1> For example, if the original number of replicas in the compute machine set is `2`, scale the replicas to `2`.
. As required, continue to modify machine sets to reference the additional failure domains that are available to the deployment.
