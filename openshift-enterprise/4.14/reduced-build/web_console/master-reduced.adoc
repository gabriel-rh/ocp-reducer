toc::[]

The Red Hat {product-title} web console provides a graphical user interface to visualize your project data and perform administrative, management, and troubleshooting tasks. The web console runs as pods on the control plane nodes in the openshift-console project. It is managed by a `console-operator` pod. Both *Administrator* and *Developer* perspectives are supported.

Both *Administrator* and *Developer* perspectives enable you to create quick start tutorials for {product-title}. A quick start is a guided tutorial with user tasks and is useful for getting oriented with an application, Operator, or other product offering.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// web_console/web-console-overview.adoc

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="about-administrator-perspective_{context}"]
= About the Administrator perspective in the web console

The *Administrator* perspective enables you to view the cluster inventory, capacity, general and specific utilization information, and the stream of important events, all of which help you to simplify planning and troubleshooting tasks. Both project administrators and cluster administrators can view the *Administrator* perspective.

Cluster administrators can also open an embedded command line terminal instance with the web terminal Operator in {product-title} 4.7 and later.

[NOTE]
====
The default web console perspective that is shown depends on the role of the user. The *Administrator* perspective is displayed by default if the user is recognized as an administrator.
====

The *Administrator* perspective provides workflows specific to administrator use cases, such as the ability to:

* Manage workload, storage, networking, and cluster settings.
* Install and manage Operators using the Operator Hub.
* Add identity providers that allow users to log in and manage user access through roles and role bindings.
* View and manage a variety of advanced settings such as cluster updates, partial cluster updates, cluster Operators, custom resource definitions (CRDs), role bindings, and resource quotas.
* Access and manage monitoring features such as metrics, alerts, and monitoring dashboards.
* View and manage logging, metrics, and high-status information about the cluster.
* Visually interact with applications, components, and services associated with the *Administrator* perspective in {product-title}.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="about-developer-perspective_{context}"]
= About the Developer perspective in the web console

The *Developer* perspective offers several built-in ways to deploy applications, services, and databases. In the *Developer* perspective, you can:

* View real-time visualization of rolling and recreating rollouts on the component.
* View the application status, resource utilization, project event streaming, and quota consumption.
* Share your project with others.
* Troubleshoot problems with your applications by running Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries on your project and examining the metrics visualized on a plot. The metrics provide information about the state of a cluster and any user-defined workloads that you are monitoring.

Cluster administrators can also open an embedded command line terminal instance in the web console in {product-title} 4.7 and later.

[NOTE]
====
The default web console perspective that is shown depends on the role of the user. The *Developer* perspective is displayed by default if the user is recognised as a developer.
====

The *Developer* perspective provides workflows specific to developer use cases, such as the ability to:

* Create and deploy applications on {product-title} by importing existing codebases, images, and container files.
* Visually interact with applications, components, and services associated with them within a project and monitor their deployment and build status.
* Group components within an application and connect the components within and across applications.
* Integrate serverless capabilities (Technology Preview).
* Create workspaces to edit your application code using Eclipse Che.

You can use the *Topology* view to display applications, components, and workloads of your project. If you have no workloads in the project, the *Topology* view will show some links to create or import them. You can also use the *Quick Search* to import components directly.

.Additional Resources
See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/applications/odc-viewing-application-composition-using-topology-view.html[Viewing application composition using the Topology] view for more information on using the *Topology* view in *Developer* perspective.

[id="accessing-perspectives_{context}"]
= Accessing the Perspectives


You can access the *Administrator* and *Developer* perspective from the web console as follows:

.Prerequisites
To access a perspective, ensure that you have logged in to the web console. Your default perspective is automatically determined by the permission of the users. The *Administrator* perspective is selected for users with access to all projects, while the *Developer* perspective is selected for users with limited access to their own projects

.Additional Resources
See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/web_console/adding-user-preferences.html[Adding User Preferences] for more information on changing perspectives.


.Procedure

. Use the perspective switcher to switch to the *Administrator* or *Developer* perspective.

. Select an existing project from the *Project* drop-down list. You can also create a new project from this dropdown.

[NOTE]
====
You can use the perspective switcher only as `cluster-admin`.

The {product-title} web console is a user interface accessible from a web browser.
Developers can use the web console to visualize, browse, and manage the contents
of projects.

== Prerequisites

* JavaScript must be enabled to use the web console. For the best experience, use
a web browser that supports
link:http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets[WebSockets].
* Review the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4128421[OpenShift Container
Platform 4.x Tested Integrations] page before you create the supporting
infrastructure for your cluster.

[id="web-console-overview_{context}"]
= Understanding and accessing the web console

The web console runs as a pod on the control plane node. The static assets required to run the web console are served by the pod.

After you install {product-title} using the `openshift-install create cluster` command, you can find the web console URL and login credentials for the installed cluster in the CLI output of the installation program. For example:

[source,terminal]
.Example output
----
INFO Install complete!
INFO Run 'export KUBECONFIG=<your working directory>/auth/kubeconfig' to manage the cluster with 'oc', the OpenShift CLI.
INFO The cluster is ready when 'oc login -u kubeadmin -p <provided>' succeeds (wait a few minutes).
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.demo1.openshift4-beta-abcorp.com
INFO Login to the console with user: kubeadmin, password: <provided>
----

Use those details to log in and access the web console.

For existing clusters that you did not install, you can use `oc whoami --show-console` to see the web console URL.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `dir` parameter specifies the `assets` directory, which stores the manifest files, the ISO image, and the `auth` directory. The `auth` directory stores the `kubeadmin-password` and `kubeconfig` files. As a `kubeadmin` user, you can use the `kubeconfig` file to access the cluster with the following setting: `export KUBECONFIG=<install_directory>/auth/kubeconfig`. The `kubeconfig` is specific to the generated ISO image, so if the `kubeconfig` is set and the `oc` command fails, it is possible that the system did not boot with the generated ISO image. To perform debugging, during the bootstrap process, you can log in to the console as the `core` user by using the contents of the `kubeadmin-password` file.

= About the {product-title} dashboards page

Access the {product-title} dashboard, which captures high-level information
about the cluster, by navigating to *Home* -> *Overview* from
the {product-title} web console.

The {product-title} dashboard provides various cluster information, captured in
individual dashboard cards.

The {product-title} dashboard consists of the following cards:

* *Details* provides a brief overview of informational cluster details.
+
Status include *ok*, *error*, *warning*, *in progress*, and *unknown*. Resources can add custom status names.
+
** Cluster ID
** Provider
** Version
* *Cluster Inventory* details number of resources and associated statuses. It is helpful when intervention is required to resolve problems, including information about:
** Number of nodes
** Number of pods
** Persistent storage volume claims
** Bare metal hosts in the cluster, listed according to their state (only available in *metal3* environment)
* *Status* helps administrators understand how cluster resources are consumed. Click on a resource to jump to a detailed page listing pods and nodes that consume the largest amount of the specified cluster resource (CPU, memory, or storage).
* *Cluster Utilization* shows the capacity of various resources over a specified period of time, to help administrators understand the scale and frequency of high resource consumption, including information about:
** CPU time
** Memory allocation
** Storage consumed
** Network resources consumed
** Pod count
* *Activity* lists messages related to recent activity in the cluster, such as pod creation or virtual machine migration to another host.

[role="_abstract"]
You can change the default preferences for your profile to meet your requirements. You can set your default project, topology view (graph or list), editing medium (form or YAML), language preferences, and resource type.

The changes made to the user preferences are automatically saved.

= Setting user preferences

You can set the default user preferences for your cluster.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console using your login credentials.
. Use the masthead to access the user preferences under the user profile.
. In the *General* section:
.. In the **Theme** field, you can set the theme that you want to work in. The console defaults to the selected theme each time you log in.
.. In the *Perspective* field, you can set the default perspective you want to be logged in to. You can select the *Administrator* or the *Developer* perspective as required. If a perspective is not selected, you are logged into the perspective you last visited.
.. In the *Project* field, select a project you want to work in. The console defaults to the project every time you log in.
.. In the *Topology* field, you can set the topology view to default to the graph or list view. If not selected, the console defaults to the last view you used.
.. In the *Create/Edit resource method* field, you can set a preference for creating or editing a resource. If both the form and YAML options are available, the console defaults to your selection.
. In the *Language* section, select *Default browser language* to use the default browser language settings. Otherwise, select the language that you want to use for the console.
. In the *Notifications* section, you can toggle display notifications created by users for specific projects on the *Overview* page or notification drawer.
. In the *Applications* section:
.. You can view the default *Resource type*. For example, if the {ServerlessOperatorName} is installed, the default resource type is *Serverless Deployment*. Otherwise, the default resource type is *Deployment*.
.. You can select another resource type to be the default resource type from the *Resource Type* field.

You can modify the {product-title} web console to set a logout redirect URL
or disable the quick start tutorials.

== Prerequisites

* Deploy an {product-title} cluster.

// Hiding in ROSA/OSD, as dedicated-admins cannot create "consoles" resource
:leveloffset: +1

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * web_console/configuring-web-console.adoc

[id="web-console-configuration_{context}"]
= Configuring the web console

You can configure the web console settings by editing the `console.config.openshift.io` resource.

* Edit the `console.config.openshift.io` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit console.config.openshift.io cluster
----
+
The following example displays the sample resource definition for the console:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Console
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  authentication:
    logoutRedirect: "" <1>
status:
  consoleURL: "" <2>
----
<1> Specify the URL of the page to load when a user logs out of the web console. If you do not specify a value, the user returns to the login page for the web console. Specifying a `logoutRedirect` URL allows your users to perform single logout (SLO) through the identity provider to destroy their single sign-on session.
<2> The web console URL. To update this to a custom value, see *Customizing the web console URL*.

toc::[]

You can customize the {product-title} web console to set a custom logo,
product name, links, notifications, and command line downloads. This is
especially helpful if you need to tailor the web console to meet specific
corporate or government requirements.

:leveloffset: +1

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * web_console/customizing-the-web-console.adoc

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="adding-a-custom-logo_{context}"]
= Adding a custom logo and product name

You can create custom branding by adding a custom logo or custom product name. You can set both or one without the other, as these settings are independent of each other.

.Prerequisites

* You must have administrator privileges.
* Create a file of the logo that you want to use. The logo can be a file in any common image format, including GIF, JPG, PNG, or SVG, and is constrained to a `max-width` of `200px` and a max-height` of `68px`. Image size must not exceed 1 MB due to constraints on the `ConfigMap` object size.

.Procedure

. Import your logo file into a config map in the `openshift-config` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap console-custom-logo --from-file /path/to/console-custom-logo.png -n openshift-config
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create the config map:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: console-custom-logo
  namespace: openshift-config
binaryData:
  console-custom-logo.png: <base64-encoded_logo> ... <1>
----
<1> Provide a valid base64-encoded logo.
====

. Edit the web console's Operator configuration to include `customLogoFile` and `customProductName`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit consoles.operator.openshift.io cluster
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Console
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  customization:
    customLogoFile:
      key: console-custom-logo.png
      name: console-custom-logo
    customProductName: My Console
----
+
Once the Operator configuration is updated, it will sync the custom logo config map into the console namespace, mount it to the console pod, and redeploy.

. Check for success. If there are any issues, the console cluster Operator will report a `Degraded` status, and the console Operator configuration will also report a `CustomLogoDegraded` status, but with reasons like `KeyOrFilenameInvalid` or `NoImageProvided`.
+
To check the `clusteroperator`, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusteroperator console -o yaml
----
+
To check the console Operator configuration, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get consoles.operator.openshift.io -o yaml

[id="customizing-the-web-console-url_{context}"]
= Customizing console routes

For `console` and `downloads` routes, custom routes functionality uses the `ingress` config route configuration API. If the `console` custom route is set up in both the `ingress` config and `console-operator` config, then the new `ingress` config custom route configuration takes precedent. The route configuration with the `console-operator` config is deprecated.

[id="customizing-the-console-route_{context}"]
== Customizing the console route

You can customize the console route by setting the custom hostname and TLS certificate in the `spec.componentRoutes` field of the cluster `Ingress` configuration.

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.
* You have created a secret in the `openshift-config` namespace containing the TLS certificate and key. This is required if the domain for the custom hostname suffix does not match the cluster domain suffix. The secret is optional if the suffix matches.
+
[TIP]
====
You can create a TLS secret by using the `oc create secret tls` command.
====

.Procedure

. Edit the cluster `Ingress` configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit ingress.config.openshift.io cluster
----

. Set the custom hostname and optionally the serving certificate and key:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1

metadata:
  name: cluster

= Customizing the login page

Create Terms of Service information with custom login pages. Custom login pages
can also be helpful if you use a third-party login provider, such as GitHub or
Google, to show users a branded page that they trust and expect before being
redirected to the authentication provider. You can also render custom error
pages during the authentication process.

[NOTE]
====
Customizing the error template is limited to identity providers (IDPs) that use redirects, such as request header and OIDC-based IDPs. It does not have an effect on IDPs that use direct password authentication, such as LDAP and htpasswd.

[id="odc-customizing-user-perspectives_{context}"]
= Customizing user perspectives

The {product-title} web console provides two perspectives by default, *Administrator* and *Developer*. You might have more perspectives available depending on installed console plugins. As a cluster administrator, you can show or hide a perspective for all users or for a specific user role. Customizing  perspectives ensures that users can view only the perspectives that are applicable to their role and tasks. For example, you can hide the *Administrator* perspective from unprivileged users so that they cannot manage cluster resources, users, and projects. Similarly, you can show the *Developer* perspective to users with the developer role so that they can create, deploy, and monitor applications.

You can also customize the perspective visibility for users based on role-based access control (RBAC). For example, if you customize a perspective for monitoring purposes, which requires specific permissions, you can define that the perspective is visible only to users with required permissions.

Each perspective includes the following mandatory parameters, which you can edit in the YAML view:

* `id`: Defines the ID of the perspective to show or hide
* `visibility`: Defines the state of the perspective along with access review checks, if needed
* `state`: Defines whether the perspective is enabled, disabled, or needs an access review check

[NOTE]
====
By default, all perspectives are enabled. When you customize the user perspective, your changes are applicable to the entire cluster.

[id="dynamic-plug-in-overview"]
== About dynamic plugins

A dynamic plugin allows you to add custom pages and other extensions to your interface at runtime. The `ConsolePlugin` custom resource registers plugins with the console, and a cluster administrator enables plugins in the `console-operator` configuration.

[id="dynamic-plugins-features"]
== Key features

A dynamic plugin allows you to make the following customizations to the {product-title} experience:

* Add custom pages.
* Add perspectives beyond administrator and developer.
* Add navigation items.
* Add tabs and actions to resource pages.

[id="general-plug-in-guidelines"]
== General guidelines
When creating your plugin, follow these general guidelines:

* link:https://nodejs.org/en/[`Node.js`] and link:https://yarnpkg.com/[`yarn`] are required to build and run your plugin.
* Prefix your CSS class names with your plugin name to avoid collisions. For example, `my-plugin_\_heading` and `my-plugin_\_icon`.
* Maintain a consistent look, feel, and behavior with other console pages.
* Follow link:https://www.i18next.com/[react-i18next] localization guidelines when creating your plugin. You can use the `useTranslation` hook like the one in the following example:
+
[source,ymal]
----
conster Header: React.FC = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation('plugin__console-demo-plugin');
  return <h1>{t('Hello, World!')}</h1>;
};
----

* Avoid selectors that could affect markup outside of your plugins components, such as element selectors. These are not APIs and are subject to change. Using them might break your plugin. Avoid selectors like element selectors that could affect markup outside of your plugins components.

[discrete]
== PatternFly guidelines
When creating your plugin, follow these guidelines for using PatternFly:

* Use link:https://www.patternfly.org/components/all-components/[PatternFly] components and PatternFly CSS variables. Core PatternFly components are available through the SDK. Using PatternFly components and variables help your plugin look consistent in future console versions.
* Make your plugin accessible by following link:https://www.patternfly.org/accessibility/accessibility-fundamentals/[PatternFly's accessibility fundamentals].
* Avoid using other CSS libraries such as Bootstrap or Tailwind. They can conflict with PatternFly and will not match the console look and feel.

. In your terminal, run the following command to install the dependencies for your plugin using yarn.

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ yarn install
----

. After installing, run the following command to start yarn.

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ yarn run start
----

. In another terminal window, login to the {product-title} through the CLI.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login
----

. Run the {product-title} web console in a container connected to the cluster you have logged into by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ yarn run start-console
----

.Verification
* Visit link:http://localhost:9000/example[localhost:9000] to view the running plugin. Inspect the value of `window.SERVER_FLAGS.consolePlugins` to see the list of plugins which load at runtime.

[id="deploy-on-cluster_{context}"]
= Deploy your plugin on a cluster

After pushing an image with your changes to a registry, you can deploy the plugin to a cluster.

.Procedure

. To deploy your plugin to a cluster, install a Helm chart with the name of the plugin as the Helm release name into a new namespace or an existing namespace as specified by the `-n` command-line option. Provide the location of the image within the `plugin.image` parameter by using the following command:

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ helm upgrade -i  my-plugin charts/openshift-console-plugin -n my-plugin-namespace --create-namespace --set plugin.image=my-plugin-image-location
----
+
Where:
+
--
`n <my-plugin-namespace>`:: Specifies an existing namespace to deploy your plugin into.
`--create-namespace`:: Optional: If deploying to a new namespace, use this parameter.
`--set plugin.image=my-plugin-image-location`:: Specifies the location of the image within the `plugin.image` parameter.
--

. Optional: You can specify any additional parameters by using the set of supported parameters in the `charts/openshift-console-plugin/values.yaml` file.

[NOTE]
====
It can take a few minutes for the new plugin configuration to appear. If you do not see your plugin, you might need to refresh your browser if the plugin was recently enabled. If you receive any errors at runtime, check the JS console in browser developer tools to look for any errors in your plugin code.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="adding-tab-to-pods-page_{context}"]
= Adding a tab to the pods page

There are different customizations you can make to the {product-title} web console. The following procedure adds a tab to the *Pod details* page as an example extension to your plugin.

[NOTE]
====
The {product-title} web console runs in a container connected to the cluster you have logged into. See "Dynamic plugin development" for information to test the plugin before creating your own.
====

.Procedure

. Visit the link:https://github.com/openshift/console-plugin-template[`console-plugin-template`] repository containing a template for creating plugins in a new tab.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Custom plugin code is not supported by Red Hat. Only link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5893251[Cooperative community support] is available for your plugin.
====

. Create a GitHub repository for the template by clicking *Use this template* -> *_Create new repository_*.

. Rename the new repository with the name of your plugin.

. Clone the new repository to your local machine so you can edit the code.

. Edit the `package.json` file, adding your plugin's metadata to the `consolePlugin` declaration. For example:
+
[source,json]

----
"consolePlugin": {
  "name": "my-plugin", <1>
  "version": "0.0.1", <2>
  "displayName": "My Plugin", <3>
  "description": "Enjoy this shiny, new console plugin!", <4>
  "exposedModules": {
    "ExamplePage": "./components/ExamplePage"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@console/pluginAPI": "/*"
  }
}
----
<1> Update the name of your plugin.
<2> Update the version.
<3> Update the display name for your plugin.
<4> Update the description with a synopsis about your plugin.

. Add the following to the `console-extensions.json` file:
+
[source,json]

----
{
  "type": "console.tab/horizontalNav",
  "properties": {
    "page": {
      "name": "Example Tab",
      "href": "example"
    },
    "model": {
      "group": "core",
      "version": "v1",
      "kind": "Pod"
    },
    "component": { "$codeRef": "ExampleTab" }
  }
}
----

. Edit the `package.json` file to include the following changes:
+
[source,json]

----
        "exposedModules": {
            "ExamplePage": "./components/ExamplePage",
            "ExampleTab": "./components/ExampleTab"
        }
----

. Write a message to display on a new custom tab on the *Pods* page by creating a new file `src/components/ExampleTab.tsx` and adding the following script:
+
[source,tsx]

----
import * as React from 'react';

export default function ExampleTab() {
    return (
        <p>This is a custom tab added to a resource using a dynamic plugin.</p>
    );
}
----

. Install a Helm chart with the name of the plugin as the Helm release name into a new namespace or an existing namespace as specified by the `-n` command-line option to deploy your plugin on a cluster. Provide the location of the image within the `plugin.image` parameter by using the following command:

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ helm upgrade -i  my-plugin charts openshift-console-plugin -n my-plugin-namespace --create-namespace --set plugin image=my-plugin-image-location
----
+
[NOTE]
====
For more information on deploying your plugin on a cluster, see "Deploy your plugin on a cluster".
====

.Verification
* Visit a *Pod* page to view the added tab.

== `useResolvedExtensions`

React hook for consuming Console extensions with resolved `CodeRef` properties. This hook accepts the same argument(s) as `useExtensions` hook and returns an adapted list of extension instances, resolving all code references within each extension's properties.

Initially, the hook returns an empty array. After the resolution is complete, the React component is re-rendered with the hook returning an adapted list of extensions. When the list of matching extensions changes, the resolution is restarted. The hook will continue to return the previous result until the resolution completes.

The hook's result elements are guaranteed to be referentially stable across re-renders. It returns a tuple containing a list of adapted extension instances with resolved code references, a boolean flag indicating whether the resolution is complete, and a list of errors detected during the resolution.

[id="troubleshooting-dynamic-plugin_{context}"]
= Troubleshooting your dynamic plugin

Refer to this list of troubleshooting tips if you run into issues loading your plugin.

* Verify that you have enabled your plugin in the console Operator configuration and your plugin name is the output by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get console.operator.openshift.io cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.plugins}'
----

** Verify the enabled plugins on the status card of the *Overview* page in the *Administrator* perspective. You must refresh your browser if the plugin was recently enabled.

* Verify your plugin service is healthy by:
** Verifying your plugin pod status is running and your containers are ready.
** Verifying the service label selector matches the pod and the target port is correct.
** Curl the `plugin-manifest.json` from the service in a terminal on the console pod or another pod on the cluster.

* Verify your `ConsolePlugin` resource name (`consolePlugin.name`) matches the plugin name used in `package.json`.

* Verify your service name, namespace, port, and path are declared correctly in the `ConsolePlugin` resource.

* Verify your plugin service uses HTTPS and service serving certificates.

* Verify any certificates or connection errors in the console pod logs.

* Verify the feature flag your plugin relys on is not disabled.

* Verify your plugin does not have any `consolePlugin.dependencies` in `package.json` that are not met.
** This can include console version dependencies or dependencies on other plugins. Filter the JS console in your browser for your plugin's name to see messages that are logged.

* Verify there are no typos in the nav extension perspective or section IDs.
** Your plugin may be loaded, but nav items missing if IDs are incorrect. Try navigating to a plugin page directly by editing the URL.

* Verify there are no network policies that are blocking traffic from the console pod to your plugin service.
** If necessary, adjust network policies to allow console pods in the openshift-console namespace to make requests to your service.

* Verify the list of dynamic plugins to be loaded in your browser in the *Console* tab of the developer tools browser.
** Evaluate `window.SERVER_FLAGS.consolePlugins` to see the dynamic plugin on the Console frontend.

You can install the web terminal by using the {web-terminal-op} listed in the {product-title} OperatorHub. When you install the {web-terminal-op}, the custom resource definitions (CRDs) that are required for the command line configuration, such as the `DevWorkspace` CRD, are automatically installed. The web console creates the required resources when you open the web terminal.

[discrete]
[id="prerequisites_installing-web-terminal"]
== Prerequisites

* You are logged into the {product-title} web console.
* You have cluster administrator permissions.

[discrete]
[id="installing-web-terminal-procedure"]
== Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Operators -> OperatorHub*.
. Use the *Filter by keyword* box to search for the {web-terminal-op} in the catalog, and then click the *Web Terminal* tile.
. Read the brief description about the Operator on the *Web Terminal*  page, and then click *Install*.
. On the *Install Operator* page, retain the default values for all fields.

** The *fast* option in the *Update Channel* menu enables installation of the latest release of the {web-terminal-op}.
** The *All namespaces on the cluster* option in the *Installation Mode* menu  enables the Operator to watch and be available to all namespaces in the cluster.
** The *openshift-operators* option in the *Installed Namespace* menu installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace.
** The *Automatic* option in the *Approval Strategy* menu ensures that the future upgrades to the Operator are handled automatically by the Operator Lifecycle Manager.

. Click *Install*.
. In the *Installed Operators* page, click the *View Operator* to verify that the Operator is listed on the *Installed Operators* page.
+
[NOTE]
====
The {web-terminal-op} installs the DevWorkspace Operator as a dependency.
====

. After the Operator is installed, refresh your page to see the command line terminal icon (image:odc-wto-icon.png[title="web terminal icon"]) in the masthead of the console.

This terminal instance is preinstalled with common CLI tools for interacting with the cluster, such as `oc`, `kubectl`,`odo`, `kn`, `tkn`, `helm`, and `subctl`. It also has the context of the project you are working on and automatically logs you in using your credentials.

= Accessing the web terminal

After the {web-terminal-op} is installed, you can access the web terminal. After the web terminal is initialized, you can use the preinstalled CLI tools like `oc`, `kubectl`, `odo`, `kn`, `tkn`, `helm`, and `subctl` in the web terminal.
You can re-run commands by selecting them from the list of commands you have run in the terminal. These commands persist across multiple terminal sessions.
The web terminal remains open until you close it or until you close the browser window or tab.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster and are logged into the web console.
* The {web-terminal-op} is installed on your cluster.

.Procedure

. To launch the web terminal, click the command line terminal icon (image:odc-wto-icon.png[title="wto icon"]) in the masthead of the console. A web terminal instance is displayed in the *Command line terminal* pane. This instance is automatically logged in with your credentials.

. If a project has not been selected in the current session, select the project where the `DevWorkspace` CR must be created from the *Project* drop-down list. By default, the current project is selected.
+
[NOTE]
====
* The `DevWorkspace` CR is created only if it does not already exist.
* The `openshift-terminal` project is the default project used for cluster administrators. They do not have the option to choose another project.  The {web-terminal-op} installs the DevWorkspace Operator as a dependency.
====

. Optional: Set the web terminal timeout for the current session:
.. Click Timeout.
.. In the field that appears, enter the timeout value.
.. From the drop-down list, select a timeout interval of *Seconds*, *Minutes*, *Hours*, or *Milliseconds*.

. Optional: Select a custom image for the web terminal to use.
.. Click Image.
.. In the field that appears, enter the URL of the image that you want to use.

. Click *Start* to initialize the web terminal using the selected project.

. Click *+* to open multiple tabs within the web terminal in the console.

== Web terminal and network policies

The web terminal might fail to launch if the cluster has network policies configured. To initialize a web terminal instance, the {web-terminal-op} must communicate with the web terminal's pod to verify it is running, and the {product-title} web console needs to send information to automatically log in to the cluster within the terminal. If either step fails, the web terminal fails to initialize and the terminal panel appears to be in a loading state.

To avoid this issue, ensure that the network policies for namespaces that are used for terminals allow ingress from the `openshift-console` and `openshift-operators` namespaces.

toc::[]

Uninstalling the {web-terminal-op} does not remove any of the custom resource definitions (CRDs) or managed resources that are created when the Operator is installed. For security purposes, you must manually uninstall these components. By removing these components, you save cluster resources because terminals do not idle when the Operator is uninstalled.

Uninstalling the web terminal is a two-step process:

. Uninstall the {web-terminal-op} and related custom resources (CRs) that were added when you installed the Operator.
. Uninstall the DevWorkspace Operator and its related custom resources that were added as a dependency of the {web-terminal-op}.

:leveloffset: +1

//
// * web_console/web_terminal/uninstalling-web-terminal.adoc

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="removing-web-terminal-operator_{context}"]
= Removing the {web-terminal-op}

You can uninstall the web terminal by removing the {web-terminal-op} and custom resources used by the Operator.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster with cluster administrator permissions.
* You have installed the `oc` CLI.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Operators -> Installed Operators*.
. Scroll the filter list or type a keyword into the *Filter by name* box to find the {web-terminal-op}.
. Click the Options menu {kebab} for the {web-terminal-op}, and then select *Uninstall Operator*.
. In the *Uninstall Operator* confirmation dialog box, click *Uninstall* to remove the Operator, Operator deployments, and pods from the cluster. The Operator stops running and no longer receives updates.
// Removed steps, as they are in the following module.

= Removing the {devworkspace-op}

To completely uninstall the web terminal, you must also remove the {devworkspace-op} and custom resources used by the Operator.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {devworkspace-op} is a standalone Operator and may be required as a dependency for other Operators installed in the cluster. Follow the steps below only if you are sure that the {devworkspace-op} is no longer needed.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster with cluster administrator permissions.
* You have installed the `oc` CLI.

// Hide step 2, cannot delete resource "customresourcedefinitions" in ROSA/OSD
// Hide step 4, cannot delete resource "mutatingwebhookconfigurations" in ROSA/OSD, do not delete deployment/devworkspace-webhook-server, see NOTE


.Procedure

. Remove the `DevWorkspace` custom resources used by the Operator, along with any related Kubernetes objects:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete devworkspaces.workspace.devfile.io --all-namespaces --all --wait
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete devworkspaceroutings.controller.devfile.io --all-namespaces --all --wait
----
+
[WARNING]
====
If this step is not complete, finalizers make it difficult to fully uninstall the Operator.
====

. Remove the CRDs used by the Operator:
+
[WARNING]
====
The DevWorkspace Operator provides custom resource definitions (CRDs) that use conversion webhooks. Failing to remove these CRDs can cause issues in the cluster.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io devworkspaceroutings.controller.devfile.io
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io devworkspaces.workspace.devfile.io
----

----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io devworkspaceoperatorconfigs.controller.devfile.io
----

. Verify that all involved custom resource definitions are removed. The following command should not display any output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io | grep "devfile.io"
----

. Remove the `devworkspace-webhook-server` deployment, mutating, and validating webhooks:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete deployment/devworkspace-webhook-server -n openshift-operators
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete mutatingwebhookconfigurations controller.devfile.io
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete validatingwebhookconfigurations controller.devfile.io
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you remove the `devworkspace-webhook-server` deployment without removing the mutating and validating webhooks, you can not use `oc exec` commands to run commands in a container in the cluster. After you remove the webhooks you can use the `oc exec` commands again.
====

. Remove any remaining services, secrets, and config maps. Depending on the installation, some resources included in the following commands may not exist in the cluster.
+
[source,terminal]

= Understanding quick starts

A quick start is a guided tutorial with user tasks. In the web console, you can access quick starts under the *Help* menu. They are especially useful for getting oriented with an application, Operator, or other product offering.

A quick start primarily consists of tasks and steps. Each task has multiple steps, and each quick start has multiple tasks. For example:

* Task 1
** Step 1
** Step 2
** Step 3
* Task 2
** Step 1
** Step 2
** Step 3
* Task 3
** Step 1
** Step 2
** Step 3

When you interact with an existing quick start tutorial, this is the expected workflow experience:

. In the *Administrator* or *Developer* perspective, click the *Help icon* and select *Quick Starts*.

. Click a quick start card.

. In the panel that appears, click *Start*.

. Complete the on-screen instructions, then click *Next*.

. In the *Check your work* module that appears, answer the question to confirm that you successfully completed the task.
.. If you select *Yes*, click *Next* to continue to the next task.
.. If you select *No*, repeat the task instructions and check your work again.

. Repeat steps 1 through 6 above to complete the remaining tasks in the quick start.
. After completing the final task, click *Close* to close the quick start.

* *Card*: The catalog tile that provides the basic information of the quick start, including title, description, time commitment, and completion status
* *Introduction*: A brief overview of the goal and tasks of the quick start
* *Task headings*: Hyper-linked titles for each task in the quick start
* *Check your work module*: A module for a user to confirm that they completed a task successfully before advancing to the next task in the quick start
* *Hints*: An animation to help users identify specific areas of the product

  introduction: >- <1>
    **Spring** is a Java framework for building applications based on a distributed microservices architecture.

    - Spring enables easy packaging and configuration of Spring applications into a self-contained executable application which can be easily deployed as a container to OpenShift.

    - Spring applications can integrate OpenShift capabilities to provide a natural "Spring on OpenShift" developer experience for both existing and net-new Spring applications. For example:

    - Externalized configuration using Kubernetes ConfigMaps and integration with Spring Cloud Kubernetes

    - Service discovery using Kubernetes Services

    - Load balancing with Replication Controllers

    - Kubernetes health probes and integration with Spring Actuator

    - Metrics: Prometheus, Grafana, and integration with Spring Cloud Sleuth

    - Distributed tracing with Istio & Jaeger tracing

    - Developer tooling through Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat CodeReady developer tooling to quickly scaffold new Spring projects, gain access to familiar Spring APIs in your favorite IDE, and deploy to Red Hat OpenShift

[id="quick-start-content-guidelines-card-copy_{context}"]
== Card copy

You can customize the title and description on a quick start card, but you cannot customize the status.

* Keep your description to one to two sentences.
* Start with a verb and communicate the goal of the user. Correct example:
+
----
Create a serverless application.
----

[id="quick-start-content-guidelines-introduction_{context}"]
== Introduction

After clicking a quick start card, a side panel slides in that introduces the quick start and lists the tasks within it.

* Make your introduction content clear, concise, informative, and friendly.
* State the outcome of the quick start. A user should understand the purpose of the quick start before they begin.
* Give action to the user, not the quick start.
** *Correct example*:
+
----
In this quick start, you will deploy a sample application to {product-title}.
----
** *Incorrect example*:
+
----
This quick start shows you how to deploy a sample application to {product-title}.
----
* The introduction should be a maximum of four to five sentences, depending on the complexity of the feature. A long introduction can overwhelm the user.
* List the quick start tasks after the introduction content, and start each task with a verb. Do not specify the number of tasks because the copy would need to be updated every time a task is added or removed.
** *Correct example*:
+
----
Tasks to complete: Create a serverless application; Connect an event source; Force a new revision
----
** *Incorrect example*:
+
----
You will complete these 3 tasks: Creating a serverless application; Connecting an event source; Forcing a new revision
----

[id="quick-start-content-guidelines-task-steps_{context}"]
== Task steps

After the user clicks *Start*, a series of steps appears that they must perform to complete the quick start.

Follow these general guidelines when writing task steps:

* Use "Click" for buttons and labels. Use "Select" for checkboxes, radio buttons, and drop-down menus.
* Use "Click" instead of "Click on"
** *Correct example*:
+
----
Click OK.
----
** *Incorrect example*:
+
----
Click on the OK button.
----

* Tell users how to navigate between *Administrator* and *Developer* perspectives. Even if you think a user might already be in the appropriate perspective, give them instructions on how to get there so that they are definitely where they need to be.
+
Examples:
+
----
Enter the Developer perspective: In the main navigation, click the dropdown menu and select Developer.
Enter the Administrator perspective: In the main navigation, click the dropdown menu and select Admin.
----

* Use the "Location, action" structure. Tell a user where to go before telling them what to do.
** *Correct example*:
+
----
In the node.js deployment, hover over the icon.
----
** *Incorrect example*:
+
----
Hover over the icon in the node.js deployment.
----

* Keep your product terminology capitalization consistent.
* If you must specify a menu type or list as a dropdown, write "dropdown” as one word without a hyphen.
* Clearly distinguish between a user action and additional information on product functionality.
** *User action*:
+
----
Change the time range of the dashboard by clicking the dropdown menu and selecting time range.
----
** *Additional information*:
+
----
To look at data in a specific time frame, you can change the time range of the dashboard.
----

* Avoid directional language, like "In the top-right corner, click the icon". Directional language becomes outdated every time UI layouts change. Also, a direction for desktop users might not be accurate for users with a different screen size. Instead, identify something using its name.
** *Correct example*:
+
----
In the navigation menu, click Settings.
----
** *Incorrect example*:
+
----
In the left-hand menu, click Settings.
----
* Do not identify items by color alone, like "Click the gray circle". Color identifiers are not useful for sight-limited users, especially colorblind users. Instead, identify an item using its name or copy, like button copy.
** *Correct example*:
+
----
The success message indicates a connection.
----
** *Incorrect example*:
+
----
The message with a green icon indicates a connection.
----

* Use the second-person point of view, you, consistently:
** *Correct example*:
+
----
Set up your environment.
----
** *Incorrect example*:
+
----
Let's set up our environment.
----

[id="quick-start-content-guidelines-check-your-work-module_{context}"]
== Check your work module

* After a user completes a step, a *Check your work* module appears. This module prompts the user to answer a yes or no question about the step results, which gives them the opportunity to review their work. For this module, you only need to write a single yes or no question.
** If the user answers *Yes*, a check mark will appear.
** If the user answers *No*, an error message appears with a link to relevant documentation, if necessary. The user then has the opportunity to go back and try again.

[id="quick-start-content-guidelines-formatting-UI-elements_{context}"]
== Formatting UI elements

Format UI elements using these guidelines:

* Copy for buttons, dropdowns, tabs, fields, and other UI controls: Write the copy as it appears in the UI and bold it.
* All other UI elements—including page, window, and panel names: Write the copy as it appears in the UI and bold it.
* Code or user-entered text: Use monospaced font.
* Hints: If a hint to a navigation or masthead element is included, style the text as you would a link.
* CLI commands: Use monospaced font.
* In running text, use a bold, monospaced font for a command.
* If a parameter or option is a variable value, use an italic monospaced font.
* Use a bold, monospaced font for the parameter and a monospaced font for the option.
