{product-title} is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes platform for developers, which enables organizations to automate the application delivery process through DevOps practices, such as continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). To meet your organizational needs, the {product-title} provides the following CI/CD solutions:

* OpenShift Builds
* {pipelines-shortname}
* OpenShift GitOps

[id="openshift-builds"]
== OpenShift Builds
OpenShift Builds provides you the following options to configure and run a build:

* Builds using Shipwright is an extensible build framework based on the Shipwright project. You can use it to build container images on an {product-title} cluster. You can build container images from source code and Dockerfile by using image build tools, such as Source-to-Image (S2I) and Buildah.
+
For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/builds/latest/about/overview-openshift-builds.html[Overview of Builds].

* Builds using `BuildConfig` objects is a declarative build process to create cloud-native apps. You can define the build process in a YAML file that you use to create a `BuildConfig` object. This definition includes attributes such as build triggers, input parameters, and source code. When deployed, the `BuildConfig` object builds a runnable image and pushes the image to a container image registry. With the `BuildConfig` object, you can create a Docker, Source-to-image (S2I), or custom build.
+
For more information, see xref:../cicd/builds/understanding-image-builds.adoc#understanding-image-builds[Understanding image builds].

[id="openshift-pipelines"]
== {pipelines-shortname}
{pipelines-shortname} provides a Kubernetes-native CI/CD framework to design and run each step of the CI/CD pipeline in its own container. It can scale independently to meet the on-demand pipelines with predictable outcomes.

For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/latest/about/understanding-openshift-pipelines.html[Understanding {pipelines-shortname}].

[id="openshift-gitops"]
== OpenShift GitOps
OpenShift GitOps is an Operator that uses Argo CD as the declarative GitOps engine. It enables GitOps workflows across multicluster OpenShift and Kubernetes infrastructure. Using OpenShift GitOps, administrators can consistently configure and deploy Kubernetes-based infrastructure and applications across clusters and development lifecycles.

For more information, see xref:../cicd/gitops/about-redhat-openshift-gitops.adoc#about-redhat-openshift-gitops[About {gitops-title}].

[id="jenkins-ci-cd"]
== Jenkins
Jenkins automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications and projects. OpenShift Developer Tools provides a Jenkins image that integrates directly with the {product-title}. Jenkins can be deployed on OpenShift by using the Samples Operator templates or certified Helm chart.

Builds is an extensible build framework based on the link:https://shipwright.io/[Shipwright project], which you can use to build container images on an {product-title} cluster. You can build container images from source code and Dockerfiles by using image build tools, such as Source-to-Image (S2I) and Buildah. You can create and apply build resources, view logs of build runs, and manage builds in your {product-title} namespaces.

Builds includes the following capabilities:

* Standard Kubernetes-native API for building container images from source code and Dockerfiles
* Support for Source-to-Image (S2I) and Buildah build strategies
* Extensibility with your own custom build strategies
* Execution of builds from source code in a local directory
* Shipwright CLI for creating and viewing logs, and managing builds on the cluster
* Integrated user experience with the *Developer* perspective of the {product-title} web console


Builds consists of the following custom resources (CRs):

* `Build`
* `BuildStrategy` and `ClusterBuildStrategy`
* `BuildRun`

[id="builds-about_{context}"]
= Builds

A build is the process of transforming input parameters into a resulting object. Most often, the process is used to transform input parameters or source code into a runnable image. A `BuildConfig` object is the definition of the entire build process.

{product-title} uses Kubernetes by creating containers from build images and pushing them to a container image registry.

Build objects share common characteristics including inputs for a build, the requirement to complete a build process, logging the build process, publishing resources from successful builds, and publishing the final status of the build. Builds take advantage of resource restrictions, specifying limitations on resources such as CPU usage, memory usage, and build or pod execution time.

The {product-title} build system provides extensible support for build strategies that are based on selectable types specified in the build API. There are three primary build strategies available:

* Docker build
* Source-to-image (S2I) build
* Custom build

By default, docker builds and S2I builds are supported.

The resulting object of a build depends on the builder used to create it. For docker and S2I builds, the resulting objects are runnable images. For custom builds, the resulting objects are whatever the builder image author has specified.

Additionally, the pipeline build strategy can be used to implement sophisticated
workflows:

* Continuous integration
* Continuous deployment

= Docker build

{product-title} uses Buildah to build a container image from a Dockerfile. For more information on building container images with Dockerfiles, see link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/[the Dockerfile reference documentation].

[TIP]
====
If you set Docker build arguments by using the `buildArgs` array, see link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-arg-and-from-interact[Understand how ARG and FROM interact] in the Dockerfile reference documentation.

[id="builds-strategy-s2i-build_{context}"]
= Source-to-image build

Source-to-image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible container images. It produces ready-to-run images by injecting application source into a container image and assembling a new image. The new image incorporates the base image, the builder, and built source and is ready to use with the `buildah run` command. S2I supports incremental builds, which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously built artifacts, and so on.


////
The advantages of S2I include the following:

[horizontal]
Image flexibility:: S2I scripts can be written to inject application code into almost any existing Docker-formatted container image, taking advantage of the existing ecosystem. Note that, currently, S2I relies on `tar` to inject application source, so the image needs to be able to process tarred content.

Speed:: With S2I, the assemble process can perform a large number of complex operations without creating a new layer at each step, resulting in a fast process. In addition, S2I scripts can be written to re-use artifacts stored in a previous version of the application image, rather than having to download or build them each time the build is run.

Patchability:: S2I allows you to rebuild the application consistently if an underlying image needs a patch due to a security issue.

Operational efficiency:: By restricting build operations instead of allowing arbitrary actions, as a Dockerfile would allow, the PaaS operator can avoid accidental or intentional abuses of the build system.

Operational security:: Building an arbitrary Dockerfile exposes the host system to root privilege escalation. This can be exploited by a malicious user because the entire Docker build process is run as a user with Docker privileges. S2I restricts the operations performed as a root user and can run the scripts as a non-root user.

User efficiency:: S2I prevents developers from performing arbitrary `yum install` type operations, which could slow down development iteration, during their application build.

Ecosystem:: S2I encourages a shared ecosystem of images where you can leverage best practices for your applications.

Reproducibility:: Produced images can include all inputs including specific versions of build tools and dependencies. This ensures that the image can be reproduced precisely.

[id="builds-strategy-custom-build_{context}"]
= Custom build

The custom build strategy allows developers to define a specific builder image responsible for the entire build process. Using your own builder image allows you to customize your build process.

A custom builder image is a plain container image embedded with build process logic, for example for building RPMs or base images.

Custom builds run with a high level of privilege and are not available to users by default. Only users who can be trusted with cluster administration permissions should be granted access to run custom builds.

[id="builds-strategy-pipeline-build_{context}"]
= Pipeline build

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Pipeline build strategy is deprecated in {product-title} 4. Equivalent and improved functionality is present in the {product-title} Pipelines based on Tekton.

Jenkins images on {product-title} are fully supported and users should follow Jenkins user documentation for defining their `jenkinsfile` in a job or store it in a Source Control Management system.
====

The Pipeline build strategy allows developers to define a Jenkins pipeline for use by the Jenkins pipeline plugin. The build can be started, monitored, and managed by {product-title} in the same way as any other build type.

Pipeline workflows are defined in a `jenkinsfile`, either embedded directly in the build configuration, or supplied in a Git repository and referenced by the build configuration.

//The first time a project defines a build configuration using a Pipeline
//strategy, {product-title} instantiates a Jenkins server to execute the
//pipeline. Subsequent Pipeline build configurations in the project share this
//Jenkins server.

//[role="_additional-resources"]
//.Additional resources

//* Pipeline build configurations require a Jenkins server to manage the
//pipeline execution.

= BuildConfigs

A build configuration describes a single build definition and a set of triggers for when a new build is created. Build configurations are defined by a `BuildConfig`, which is a REST object that can be used in a POST to the API server to create a new instance.

A build configuration, or `BuildConfig`, is characterized by a build strategy
and one or more sources. The strategy determines the process, while the sources provide its input.

Depending on how you choose to create your application using {product-title}, a `BuildConfig` is typically generated automatically for you if you use the web console or CLI, and it can be edited at any time. Understanding the parts that make up a `BuildConfig` and their available options can help if you choose to manually change your configuration later.

The following example `BuildConfig` results in a new build every time a container image tag or the source code changes:

.`BuildConfig` object definition

        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "ruby-20-centos7:latest"

    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
  postCommit: <7>
      script: "bundle exec rake test"
----
<1> This specification creates a new `BuildConfig` named `ruby-sample-build`.
<2> The `runPolicy` field controls whether builds created from this build configuration can be run simultaneously. The default value is `Serial`, which means new builds run sequentially, not simultaneously.
<3> You can specify a list of triggers, which cause a new build to be created.
<4> The `source` section defines the source of the build. The source type determines the primary source of input, and can be either `Git`, to point to a code repository location,
`Dockerfile`, to build from an inline Dockerfile,
or `Binary`, to accept binary payloads. It is possible to have multiple sources at once. For more information about each source type, see "Creating build inputs".
<5> The `strategy` section describes the build strategy used to execute the build. You can specify a `Source`
, `Docker`, or `Custom`
strategy here. This example uses the `ruby-20-centos7` container image that Source-to-image (S2I) uses for the application build.
<6> After the container image is successfully built, it is pushed into the repository described in the `output` section.
<7> The `postCommit` section defines an optional build hook.

Use the following sections for an overview of build inputs, instructions on how
to use inputs to provide source content for builds to operate on, and how to use
build environments and create secrets.

[id="builds-define-build-inputs_{context}"]
= Build inputs

A build input provides source content for builds to operate on. You can use the following build inputs to provide sources in {product-title}, listed in order of precedence:

* Inline Dockerfile definitions
* Content extracted from existing images
* Git repositories
* Binary (Local) inputs
* Input secrets
* External artifacts


You can combine multiple inputs in a single build.
However, as the inline Dockerfile takes precedence, it can overwrite any other file named Dockerfile provided by another input.
Binary (local) input and Git repositories are mutually exclusive inputs.

You can use input secrets when you do not want certain resources or credentials used during a build to be available in the final application image produced by the build, or want to consume a value that is defined in a secret resource. External artifacts can be used to pull in additional files that are not available as one of the other build input types.

When you run a build:

. A working directory is constructed and all input content is placed in the working directory. For example, the input Git repository is cloned into the working directory, and files specified from input images are copied into the working directory using the target path.

. The build process changes directories into the `contextDir`, if one is defined.

. The inline Dockerfile, if any, is written to the current directory.

. The content from the current directory is provided to the build process
for reference by the
Dockerfile, custom builder logic, or
`assemble` script. This means any input content that resides outside the `contextDir` is ignored by the build.

The following example of a source definition includes multiple input types and an explanation of how they are combined. For more details on how each input type is defined, see the specific sections for each input type.

[source,yaml]

  git:
    uri: https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git <1>

[id="builds-dockerfile-source_{context}"]
= Dockerfile source

When you supply a `dockerfile` value, the content of this field is written to disk as a file named `dockerfile`. This is done after other input sources are processed, so if the input source repository contains a Dockerfile in the root directory, it is overwritten with this content.

The source definition is part of the `spec` section in the `BuildConfig`:

[source,yaml]

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT

[id="builds-image-source_{context}"]
= Image source

You can add additional files to the build process with images. Input images are referenced in the same way the `From` and `To` image targets are defined. This means both container images and image stream tags can be referenced. In conjunction with the image, you must provide one or more path pairs to indicate the path of the files or directories to copy the image and the destination to place them in the build context.

The source path can be any absolute path within the image specified. The destination must be a relative directory path. At build time, the image is loaded and the indicated files and directories are copied into the context directory of the build process. This is the same directory into which the source repository content is cloned. If the source path ends in `/.` then the content of the directory is copied, but the directory itself is not created at the destination.

Image inputs are specified in the `source` definition of the `BuildConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----

  git:
    uri: https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git

[NOTE]
====
If your cluster uses an `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, `ImageTagMirrorSet`, or `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object to configure repository mirroring, you can use only global pull secrets for mirrored registries. You cannot add a pull secret to a project.
====

.Images that require pull secrets

When using an input image that requires a pull secret, you can link the pull secret to the service account used by the build. By default, builds use the `builder` service account. The pull secret is automatically added to the build if the secret contains a credential that matches the repository hosting the input image. To link a pull secret to the service account used by the build, run:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc secrets link builder dockerhub
----

[NOTE]
====
This feature is not supported for builds using the custom strategy.
====

.Images on mirrored registries that require pull secrets

When using an input image from a mirrored registry, if you get a `build error: failed to pull image` message, you can resolve the error by using either of the following methods:

* Create an input secret that contains the authentication credentials for the builder image’s repository and all known mirrors. In this case, create a pull secret for credentials to the image registry and its mirrors.
* Use the input secret as the pull secret on the `BuildConfig` object.

[id="builds-source-code_{context}"]
= Git source

When specified, source code is fetched from the supplied location.

If you supply an inline Dockerfile, it overwrites the Dockerfile in the `contextDir` of the Git repository.

The source definition is part of the `spec` section in the `BuildConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
source:
  git: <1>
    uri: "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world"
    ref: "master"
  contextDir: "app/dir" <2>
  dockerfile: "FROM openshift/ruby-22-centos7\nUSER example" <3>
----
<1> The `git` field contains the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to the remote Git repository of the source code. You must specify the value of the `ref` field to check out a specific Git reference. A valid `ref` can be a SHA1 tag or a branch name. The default value of the `ref` field is `master`.
<2> The `contextDir` field allows you to override the default location inside the source code repository where the build looks for the application source code. If your application exists inside a sub-directory, you can override the default location (the root folder) using this field.
<3> If the optional `dockerfile` field is provided, it should be a string containing a Dockerfile that overwrites any Dockerfile that may exist in the source repository.

If the `ref` field denotes a pull request, the system uses a `git fetch` operation and then checkout `FETCH_HEAD`.

When no `ref` value is provided, {product-title} performs a shallow clone (`--depth=1`). In this case, only the files associated with the most recent commit on the default branch (typically `master`) are downloaded. This results in repositories downloading faster, but without the full commit history. To perform a full `git clone` of the default branch of a specified repository, set `ref` to the name of the default branch (for example `main`).


[WARNING]
====
Git clone operations that go through a proxy that is performing man in the middle (MITM) TLS hijacking or reencrypting of the proxied connection do not work.

= Using a proxy

If your Git repository can only be accessed using a proxy, you can define the proxy to use in the `source` section of the build configuration. You can configure both an HTTP and HTTPS proxy to use. Both fields are optional. Domains for which no proxying should be performed can also be specified in the `NoProxy` field.

[NOTE]
====
Your source URI must use the HTTP or HTTPS protocol for this to work.
====

[source,yaml]
----

    httpsProxy: https://proxy.example.com
    noProxy: somedomain.com, otherdomain.com
----

[NOTE]
====
For Pipeline strategy builds, given the current restrictions with the Git plugin for Jenkins, any Git operations through the Git plugin do not leverage the HTTP or HTTPS proxy defined in the `BuildConfig`. The Git plugin only uses the proxy configured in the Jenkins UI at the Plugin Manager panel. This proxy is then used for all git interactions within Jenkins, across all jobs.

= Source Clone Secrets

Builder pods require access to any Git repositories defined as source for a build. Source clone secrets are used to provide the builder pod with access it would not normally have access to, such as private repositories or repositories with self-signed or untrusted SSL certificates.

The following source clone secret configurations are supported:

* .gitconfig File
* Basic Authentication
* SSH Key Authentication
* Trusted Certificate Authorities

[NOTE]
====
You can also use combinations of these configurations to meet your specific needs.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-automatically-add-source-clone-secrets_{context}"]
= Automatically adding a source clone secret to a build configuration

When a `BuildConfig` is created, {product-title} can automatically populate its source clone secret reference. This behavior allows the resulting builds to automatically use the credentials stored in the referenced secret to authenticate to a remote Git repository, without requiring further configuration.

To use this functionality, a secret containing the Git repository credentials must exist in the namespace in which the `BuildConfig` is later created. This secrets must include one or more annotations prefixed with `build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-`. The value of each of these annotations is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) pattern, which is defined as follows. When a `BuildConfig` is created without a source clone secret reference and its Git source URI matches a URI pattern in a secret annotation, {product-title} automatically inserts a reference to that secret in the `BuildConfig`.

.Prerequisites

A URI pattern must consist of:

* A valid scheme: `*://`, `git://`, `http://`, `https://` or `ssh://`
* A host: \*` or a valid hostname or IP address optionally preceded by `*.`
* A path: `/\*` or `/` followed by any characters optionally including `*` characters

In all of the above, a `*` character is interpreted as a wildcard.

[IMPORTANT]
====
URI patterns must match Git source URIs which are conformant to link:https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt[RFC3986]. Do not include a username (or password) component in a URI pattern.

For example, if you use `ssh://git@bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/ATLASSIAN jira.git` for a git repository URL, the source secret must be specified as `pass:c[ssh://bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/*]` (and not `pass:c[ssh://git@bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/*]`).

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate secret mysecret \
    'build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1=ssh://bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/*'
----

====

.Procedure

If multiple secrets match the Git URI of a particular `BuildConfig`, {product-title} selects the secret with the longest match. This allows for basic overriding, as in the following example.

The following fragment shows two partial source clone secrets, the first matching any server in the domain `mycorp.com` accessed by HTTPS, and the second overriding access to servers `mydev1.mycorp.com` and `mydev2.mycorp.com`:

[source,yaml]

[id="builds-source-secret-trusted-ca_{context}"]
= Creating a secret from source code trusted certificate authorities

The set of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate authorities (CA) that are trusted during a Git clone operation are built into the {product-title} infrastructure images. If your Git server uses a self-signed certificate or one signed by an authority not trusted by the image, you can create a secret that contains the certificate or disable TLS verification.

If you create a secret for the CA certificate, {product-title} uses it to access your Git server during the Git clone operation. Using this method is significantly more secure than disabling Git SSL verification, which accepts any TLS certificate that is presented.

.Procedure

Create a secret with a CA certificate file.

. If your CA uses Intermediate Certificate Authorities, combine the certificates for all CAs in a `ca.crt` file. Enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat intermediateCA.crt intermediateCA.crt rootCA.crt > ca.crt
----

.. Create the secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic mycert --from-file=ca.crt=</path/to/file> <1>
----
<1> You must use the key name `ca.crt`.

[id="builds-binary-source_{context}"]
= Binary (local) source

Streaming content from a local file system to the builder is called a `Binary` type build. The corresponding value of `BuildConfig.spec.source.type` is `Binary` for these builds.

This source type is unique in that it is leveraged solely based on your use of the `oc start-build`.

[NOTE]
====
Binary type builds require content to be streamed from the local file system, so automatically triggering a binary type build, like an image change trigger, is not possible. This is because the binary files cannot be provided. Similarly, you cannot launch binary type builds from the web console.
====

To utilize binary builds, invoke `oc start-build` with one of these options:

* `--from-file`: The contents of the file you specify are sent as a binary stream to the builder. You can also specify a URL to a file. Then, the builder stores the data in a file with the same name at the top of the build context.

* `--from-dir` and `--from-repo`: The contents are archived and sent as a binary stream to the builder. Then, the builder extracts the contents of the archive within the build context directory. With `--from-dir`, you can also specify a URL to an archive, which is extracted.

* `--from-archive`: The archive you specify is sent to the builder, where it is extracted within the build context directory. This option behaves the same as `--from-dir`; an archive is created on your host first, whenever the argument to these options is a directory.

In each of the previously listed cases:

* If your `BuildConfig` already has a `Binary` source type defined, it is effectively ignored and replaced by what the client sends.

* If your `BuildConfig` has a `Git` source type defined, it is dynamically disabled, since `Binary` and `Git` are mutually exclusive, and the data in the binary stream provided to the builder takes precedence.

Instead of a file name, you can pass a URL with HTTP or HTTPS schema to `--from-file` and `--from-archive`. When using `--from-file` with a URL, the name of the file in the builder image is determined by the `Content-Disposition` header sent by the web server, or the last component of the URL path if the header is not present. No form of authentication is supported and it is not possible to use custom TLS certificate or disable certificate validation.

When using `oc new-build --binary=true`, the command ensures that the restrictions associated with binary builds are enforced. The resulting `BuildConfig` has a source type of `Binary`, meaning that the only valid way to run a build for this `BuildConfig` is to use `oc start-build` with one of the `--from` options to provide the requisite binary data.

The Dockerfile and `contextDir` source options have special meaning with binary builds.

Dockerfile can be used with any binary build source. If Dockerfile is used and the binary stream is an archive, its contents serve as a replacement Dockerfile to any Dockerfile in the archive. If Dockerfile is used with the `--from-file` argument, and the file argument is named Dockerfile, the value from Dockerfile replaces the value from the binary stream.

In the case of the binary stream encapsulating extracted archive content, the value of the `contextDir` field is interpreted as a subdirectory within the archive, and, if valid, the builder changes into that subdirectory before executing the build.

[id="builds-input-secrets-configmaps_{context}"]
= Input secrets and config maps

[IMPORTANT]
====
To prevent the contents of input secrets and config maps from appearing in build output container images, use build volumes in your xref:../../cicd/builds/build-strategies.adoc#builds-using-build-volumes_build-strategies-docker[Docker build] and xref:../../cicd/builds/build-strategies.adoc#builds-using-build-volumes_build-strategies-s2i[source-to-image build] strategies.
====

In some scenarios, build operations require credentials or other configuration data to access dependent resources, but it is undesirable for that information to be placed in source control. You can define input secrets and input config maps for this purpose.

For example, when building a Java application with Maven, you can set up a private mirror of Maven Central or JCenter that is accessed by private keys. To download libraries from that private mirror, you have to supply the
following:

. A `settings.xml` file configured with the mirror's URL and connection settings.
. A private key referenced in the settings file, such as `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

For security reasons, you do not want to expose your credentials in the application image.

This example describes a Java application, but you can use the same approach for adding SSL certificates into the `/etc/ssl/certs` directory, API keys or tokens, license files, and more.

= What is a secret?

The `Secret` object type provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such as passwords, {product-title} client configuration files, `dockercfg` files, private source repository credentials, and so on. Secrets decouple sensitive content from the pods. You can mount secrets into containers using a volume plugin or the system can use secrets to perform actions on behalf of a pod.

<5> The value associated with keys in the `stringData` map is made up of plain text strings.

[id="builds-secrets-overview-properties_{context}"]
== Properties of secrets

Key properties include:

* Secret data can be referenced independently from its definition.
* Secret data volumes are backed by temporary file-storage facilities (tmpfs) and never come to rest on a node.
* Secret data can be shared within a namespace.

[id="builds-secrets-overview-types_{context}"]
== Types of Secrets

The value in the `type` field indicates the structure of the secret's key names and values. The type can be used to enforce the presence of user names and keys in the secret object. If you do not want validation, use the `opaque` type, which is the default.

Specify one of the following types to trigger minimal server-side validation to ensure the presence of specific key names in the secret data:

* `kubernetes.io/service-account-token`. Uses a service account token.
* `kubernetes.io/dockercfg`. Uses the `.dockercfg` file for required Docker credentials.
* `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`. Uses the `.docker/config.json` file for required Docker credentials.
* `kubernetes.io/basic-auth`. Use with basic authentication.
* `kubernetes.io/ssh-auth`. Use with SSH key authentication.
* `kubernetes.io/tls`. Use with TLS certificate authorities.

Specify `type= Opaque` if you do not want validation, which means the secret does not claim to conform to any convention for key names or values. An `opaque` secret, allows for unstructured `key:value` pairs that can contain arbitrary values.

[NOTE]
====
You can specify other arbitrary types, such as `example.com/my-secret-type`. These types are not enforced server-side, but indicate that the creator of the
secret intended to conform to the key/value requirements of that type.
====

[id="builds-secrets-overview-updates_{context}"]
== Updates to secrets

When you modify the value of a secret, the value used by an already running pod does not dynamically change. To change a secret, you must delete the original pod and create a new pod, in some cases with an identical `PodSpec`.

Updating a secret follows the same workflow as deploying a new container image. You can use the `kubectl rolling-update` command.

The `resourceVersion` value in a secret is not specified when it is referenced. Therefore, if a secret is updated at the same time as pods are starting, the version of the secret that is used for the pod is not defined.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, it is not possible to check the resource version of a secret object that was used when a pod was created. It is planned that pods report this information, so that a controller could restart ones using an old `resourceVersion`. In the interim, do not update the data of existing secrets, but create new ones with distinct names.

[id="builds-adding-input-secrets-configmaps_{context}"]
= Adding input secrets and config maps

To provide credentials and other configuration data to a build without placing them in source control, you can define input secrets and input config maps.

In some scenarios, build operations require credentials or other configuration data to access dependent resources. To make that information available without placing it in source control, you can define input secrets and input config maps.

.Procedure

To add an input secret, config maps, or both to an existing `BuildConfig` object:

. Create the `ConfigMap` object, if it does not exist:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap settings-mvn \
    --from-file=settings.xml=<path/to/settings.xml>
----
+
This creates a new config map named `settings-mvn`, which contains the plain text content of the `settings.xml` file.
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create the config map:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: core/v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: settings-mvn
data:
  settings.xml: |
    <settings>
    … # Insert maven settings here
    </settings>
----
====


. Create the `Secret` object, if it does not exist:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic secret-mvn \
    --from-file=ssh-privatekey=<path/to/.ssh/id_rsa>
    --type=kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
----
+
This creates a new secret named `secret-mvn`, which contains the base64 encoded content of the `id_rsa` private key.
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create the input secret:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: core/v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secret-mvn
type: kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
data:
  ssh-privatekey: |
    # Insert ssh private key, base64 encoded
----
====

. Add the config map and secret to the `source` section in the existing
`BuildConfig` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
source:
  git:
    uri: https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git
  contextDir: helloworld
  configMaps:
    - configMap:
        name: settings-mvn
  secrets:
    - secret:
        name: secret-mvn
----

To include the secret and config map in a new `BuildConfig` object, run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-build \
    openshift/wildfly-101-centos7~https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git \
    --context-dir helloworld --build-secret “secret-mvn” \
    --build-config-map "settings-mvn"
----

During the build, the `settings.xml` and `id_rsa` files are copied into the directory where the source code is located. In {product-title} S2I builder images, this is the image working directory, which is set using the `WORKDIR` instruction in the `Dockerfile`. If you want to specify another directory, add a `destinationDir` to the definition:

[source,yaml]
----
source:
  git:
    uri: https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git
  contextDir: helloworld
  configMaps:
    - configMap:
        name: settings-mvn
      destinationDir: ".m2"
  secrets:
    - secret:
        name: secret-mvn
      destinationDir: ".ssh"
----

You can also specify the destination directory when creating a new `BuildConfig` object:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-build \
    openshift/wildfly-101-centos7~https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git \
    --context-dir helloworld --build-secret “secret-mvn:.ssh” \
    --build-config-map "settings-mvn:.m2"
----

In both cases, the `settings.xml` file is added to the `./.m2` directory of the build environment, and the `id_rsa` key is added to the `./.ssh` directory.

[id="builds-source-to-image_{context}"]
= Source-to-image strategy

When using a `Source` strategy, all defined input secrets are copied to their respective `destinationDir`. If you left `destinationDir` empty, then the secrets are placed in the working directory of the builder image.

The same rule is used when a `destinationDir` is a relative path. The secrets are placed in the paths that are relative to the working directory of the image. The final directory in the `destinationDir` path is created if it does not exist in the builder image. All preceding directories in the `destinationDir` must exist, or an error will occur.

[NOTE]
====
Input secrets are added as world-writable, have `0666` permissions, and are truncated to size zero after executing the `assemble` script. This means that the secret files exist in the resulting image, but they are empty for security reasons.

Input config maps are not truncated after the `assemble` script completes.

[id="builds-docker-strategy_{context}"]
= Docker strategy

When using a docker strategy, you can add all defined input secrets into your container image using the link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#add[`ADD`] and link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy[`COPY` instructions] in your Dockerfile.

If you do not specify the `destinationDir` for a secret, then the files are copied into the same directory in which the Dockerfile is located. If you specify a relative path as `destinationDir`, then the secrets are copied into that directory, relative to your Dockerfile location. This makes the secret files available to the Docker build operation as part of the context directory used during the build.

.Example of a Dockerfile referencing secret and config map data
----
FROM centos/ruby-22-centos7

USER root
COPY ./secret-dir /secrets
COPY ./config /

# Create a shell script that will output secrets and ConfigMaps when the image is run
RUN echo '#!/bin/sh' > /input_report.sh

RUN chmod 755 /input_report.sh

CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/input_report.sh"]
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Users normally remove their input secrets from the final application image so that the secrets are not present in the container running from that image. However, the secrets still exist in the image itself in the layer where they were added. This removal is part of the Dockerfile itself.

To prevent the contents of input secrets and config maps from appearing in the build output container images and avoid this removal process altogether, xref:../../cicd/builds/build-strategies.adoc#builds-using-build-volumes_build-strategies-docker[use build volumes] in your Docker build strategy instead.

[id="builds-custom-strategy_{context}"]
= Custom strategy

When using a Custom strategy, all the defined input secrets and config maps are available in the builder container in the `/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/build` directory. The custom build image must use these secrets and config maps appropriately. With the Custom strategy, you can define secrets as described in Custom strategy options.

There is no technical difference between existing strategy secrets and the input secrets. However, your builder image can distinguish between them and use them differently, based on your build use case.

The input secrets are always mounted into the `/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/build` directory, or your builder can parse the `$BUILD` environment variable, which includes the full build object.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If a pull secret for the registry exists in both the namespace and the node, builds default to using the pull secret in the namespace.

[id="builds-using-external-artifacts_{context}"]
= External artifacts

It is not recommended to store binary files in a source repository. Therefore, you must define a build which pulls additional files, such as Java `.jar` dependencies, during the build process. How this is done depends on the build strategy you are using.

For a Source build strategy, you must put appropriate shell commands into the `assemble` script:

.`.s2i/bin/assemble` File
[source,terminal]
----
#!/bin/sh
APP_VERSION=1.0
wget http://repository.example.com/app/app-$APP_VERSION.jar -O app.jar
----

.`.s2i/bin/run` File
[source,terminal]
----
#!/bin/sh
exec java -jar app.jar
----

For a Docker build strategy, you must modify the Dockerfile and invoke
shell commands with the link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run[`RUN` instruction]:

.Excerpt of Dockerfile
[source,terminal]
----
FROM jboss/base-jdk:8

ENV APP_VERSION 1.0
RUN wget http://repository.example.com/app/app-$APP_VERSION.jar -O app.jar

EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "java", "-jar", "app.jar" ]
----

In practice, you may want to use an environment variable for the file location so that the specific file to be downloaded can be customized using an environment variable defined on the `BuildConfig`, rather than updating the
Dockerfile or
`assemble` script.

You can choose between different methods of defining environment variables:

* Using the `.s2i/environment` file] (only for a Source build strategy)
* Setting in `BuildConfig`
* Providing explicitly using `oc start-build --env` (only for builds that are triggered manually)

//.Additional resources

//used by a Source build, see Overriding builder image scripts.

[id="builds-docker-credentials-private-registries_{context}"]
= Using docker credentials for private registries

You can supply builds with a .`docker/config.json` file with valid credentials for private container registries. This allows you to push the output image into a private container image registry or pull a builder image from the private container image registry that requires authentication.

You can supply credentials for multiple repositories within the same registry, each with credentials specific to that registry path.

[NOTE]
====
For the {product-title} container image registry, this is not required because secrets are generated automatically for you by {product-title}.
====

The `.docker/config.json` file is found in your home directory by default and
has the following format:

[source,yaml]
----
auths:
  index.docker.io/v1/: <1>
    auth: "YWRfbGzhcGU6R2labnRib21ifTE=" <2>
    email: "user@example.com" <3>
  docker.io/my-namespace/my-user/my-image: <4>
    auth: "GzhYWRGU6R2fbclabnRgbkSp=""
    email: "user@example.com"
  docker.io/my-namespace: <5>
    auth: "GzhYWRGU6R2deesfrRgbkSp=""
    email: "user@example.com"
----
<1> URL of the registry.
<2> Encrypted password.
<3> Email address for the login.
<4> URL and credentials for a specific image in a namespace.
<5> URL and credentials for a registry namespace.

You can define multiple container image registries or define multiple repositories in the same registry. Alternatively, you can also add authentication entries to this file by running the `docker login` command. The file will be created if it does not exist.

Kubernetes provides `Secret` objects, which can be used to store configuration and passwords.

.Prerequisites

* You must have a `.docker/config.json` file.

.Procedure

. Create the secret from your local `.docker/config.json` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic dockerhub \
    --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path/to/.docker/config.json> \
    --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----
+
This generates a JSON specification of the secret named `dockerhub` and creates the object.
+
. Add a `pushSecret` field into the `output` section of the `BuildConfig` and set it to the name of the `secret` that you created, which in the previous example is `dockerhub`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "private.registry.com/org/private-image:latest"
    pushSecret:
      name: "dockerhub"
----
+
You can use the `oc set build-secret` command to set the push secret on the build configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set build-secret --push bc/sample-build dockerhub
----
+
You can also link the push secret to the service account used by the build instead of specifying the `pushSecret` field. By default, builds use the `builder` service account. The push secret is automatically added to the build if the secret contains a credential that matches the repository hosting the build's output image.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc secrets link builder dockerhub
----
+
. Pull the builder container image from a private container image registry by specifying the `pullSecret` field, which is part of the build strategy definition:
+
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "docker.io/user/private_repository"
    pullSecret:
      name: "dockerhub"
----
+
You can use the `oc set build-secret` command to set the pull secret on the build configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set build-secret --pull bc/sample-build dockerhub
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This example uses `pullSecret` in a Source build, but it is also applicable in Docker and Custom builds.
====
+
You can also link the pull secret to the service account used by the build instead of specifying the `pullSecret` field. By default, builds use the `builder` service account. The pull secret is automatically added to the build if the secret contains a credential that matches the repository hosting the build's input image. To link the pull secret to the service account used by the build instead of specifying the `pullSecret` field, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc secrets link builder dockerhub
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You must specify a `from` image in the `BuildConfig` spec to take advantage of this feature. Docker strategy builds generated by `oc new-build` or `oc new-app` may not do this in some situations.

[id="builds-build-environment_{context}"]
= Build environments

As with pod environment variables, build environment variables can be defined in terms of references to other resources or variables using the Downward API. There are some exceptions, which are noted.

You can also manage environment variables defined in the `BuildConfig` with the `oc set env` command.

[NOTE]
====
Referencing container resources using `valueFrom` in build environment variables is not supported as the references are resolved before the container is created.

Jenkins Pipeline strategy does not support `valueFrom` syntax for environment variables.
====

.Procedure

* Set the `fieldPath` environment variable source to the `JsonPath` of the field from which you are interested in obtaining the value:

[id="builds-service-serving-certificate-secrets_{context}"]
= Service serving certificate secrets

Service serving certificate secrets are intended to support complex middleware applications that need out-of-the-box certificates. It has the same settings as the server certificates generated by the administrator tooling for nodes and masters.

.Procedure

To secure communication to your service, have the cluster generate a signed serving certificate/key pair into a secret in your namespace.

* Set the `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name` annotation on your service with the value set to the name you want to use for your secret.
+
Then, your `PodSpec` can mount that secret. When it is available, your pod runs. The certificate is good for the internal service DNS name, `<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc`.
+
The certificate and key are in PEM format, stored in `tls.crt` and `tls.key` respectively. The certificate/key pair is automatically replaced when it gets close to expiration. View the expiration date in the `service.beta.openshift.io/expiry` annotation on the secret, which is in RFC3339 format.

[NOTE]
====
In most cases, the service DNS name `<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc` is not externally routable. The primary use of `<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc` is for intracluster or intraservice communication, and with re-encrypt routes.
====

Other pods can trust cluster-created certificates, which are only signed for
internal DNS names, by using the certificate authority (CA) bundle in the `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt` file that is automatically mounted in their pod.

The signature algorithm for this feature is `x509.SHA256WithRSA`. To manually rotate, delete the generated secret. A new certificate is created.

[id="builds-secrets-restrictions_{context}"]
= Secrets restrictions

To use a secret, a pod needs to reference the secret. A secret can be used with a pod in three ways:

* To populate environment variables for containers.
* As files in a volume mounted on one or more of its containers.
* By kubelet when pulling images for the pod.

Volume type secrets write data into the container as a file using the volume mechanism. `imagePullSecrets` use service accounts for the automatic injection of the secret into all pods in a namespaces.

When a template contains a secret definition, the only way for the template to use the provided secret is to ensure that the secret volume sources are validated and that the specified object reference actually points to an object of type `Secret`. Therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that depend on it. The most effective way to ensure this is to have it get injected automatically through the use of a service account.

Secret API objects reside in a namespace. They can only be referenced by pods in that same namespace.

Individual secrets are limited to 1MB in size. This is to discourage the creation of large secrets that would exhaust apiserver and kubelet memory. However, creation of a number of smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.

= Build output

Builds that use the
docker or
source-to-image (S2I) strategy result in the creation of a new container image. The image is then pushed to the container image registry specified in the `output` section of the `Build` specification.

If the output kind is `ImageStreamTag`, then the image will be pushed to the integrated {product-registry} and tagged in the specified imagestream. If the output is of type `DockerImage`, then the name of the output reference will be used as a docker push specification. The specification may contain a registry or will default to DockerHub if no registry is specified. If the output section of the build specification is empty, then the image will not be pushed at the end of the build.

= Replacing Dockerfile FROM image

You can replace the `FROM` instruction of the Dockerfile with the `from` of the `BuildConfig` object. If the Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds, the image in the last `FROM` instruction will be replaced.

.Procedure

To replace the `FROM` instruction of the Dockerfile with the `from` of the `BuildConfig`.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-strategy-dockerfile-path_{context}"]
= Using Dockerfile path

By default, docker builds use a Dockerfile located at the root of the context specified in the `BuildConfig.spec.source.contextDir` field.

The `dockerfilePath` field allows the build to use a different path to locate your Dockerfile, relative to the `BuildConfig.spec.source.contextDir` field. It can be a different file name than the default Dockerfile, such as `MyDockerfile`, or a path to a Dockerfile in a subdirectory, such as `dockerfiles/app1/Dockerfile`.

.Procedure

To use the `dockerfilePath` field for the build to use a different path to locate your Dockerfile, set:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  dockerStrategy:
    dockerfilePath: dockerfiles/app1/Dockerfile

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-strategy-docker-environment-variables_{context}"]
= Using docker environment variables

To make environment variables available to the docker build process and resulting image, you can add environment variables to the `dockerStrategy` definition of the build configuration.

The environment variables defined there are inserted as a single `ENV` Dockerfile instruction right after the `FROM` instruction, so that it can be referenced later on within the Dockerfile.

.Procedure

The variables are defined during build and stay in the output image, therefore they will be present in any container that runs that image as well.

For example, defining a custom HTTP proxy to be used during build and runtime:

[source,yaml]
----
dockerStrategy:
...
  env:
    - name: "HTTP_PROXY"
      value: "http://myproxy.net:5187/"
----

You can also manage environment variables defined in the build configuration with the `oc set env` command.

= Adding docker build arguments

You can set link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg[docker build arguments] using the `buildArgs` array. The build arguments are passed to docker when a build is started.

[TIP]
====
See link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-arg-and-from-interact[Understand how ARG and FROM interact] in the Dockerfile reference documentation.

.Procedure

To set docker build arguments, add entries to the `buildArgs` array, which is located in the `dockerStrategy` definition of the `BuildConfig` object. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
dockerStrategy:
...
  buildArgs:
    - name: "foo"

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-using-build-volumes_{context}"]
= Using build volumes

You can mount build volumes to give running builds access to information that you don't want to persist in the output container image.

Build volumes provide sensitive information, such as repository credentials, that the build environment or configuration only needs at build time. Build volumes are different from xref:../../cicd/builds/creating-build-inputs.adoc#builds-define-build-inputs_creating-build-inputs[build inputs], whose data can persist in the output container image.

The mount points of build volumes, from which the running build reads data, are functionally similar to link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/[pod volume mounts].

.Prerequisites
* You have xref:../../cicd/builds/creating-build-inputs.adoc#builds-input-secrets-configmaps_creating-build-inputs[added an input secret, config map, or both to a BuildConfig object].

.Procedure


* In the `dockerStrategy` definition of the `BuildConfig` object, add any build volumes to the `volumes` array. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  dockerStrategy:
    volumes:
      - name: secret-mvn <1>
        mounts:
        - destinationPath: /opt/app-root/src/.ssh <2>

            readOnly: true <6>
            volumeAttributes: <7>
              attribute: value
----
<1> Required. A unique name.
<2> Required. The absolute path of the mount point. It must not contain `..` or `:` and doesn't collide with the destination path generated by the builder. The `/opt/app-root/src` is the default home directory for many Red Hat S2I-enabled images.
<3> Required. The type of source, `ConfigMap`, `Secret`, or `CSI`.
<4> Required. The name of the source.
<5> Required. The driver that provides the ephemeral CSI volume.
<6> Required. This value must be set to `true`. Provides a read-only volume.

[id="builds-strategy-s2i-build_{context}"]
= Source-to-image build

Source-to-image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible container images. It produces ready-to-run images by injecting application source into a container image and assembling a new image. The new image incorporates the base image, the builder, and built source and is ready to use with the `buildah run` command. S2I supports incremental builds, which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously built artifacts, and so on.


////
The advantages of S2I include the following:

[horizontal]
Image flexibility:: S2I scripts can be written to inject application code into almost any existing Docker-formatted container image, taking advantage of the existing ecosystem. Note that, currently, S2I relies on `tar` to inject application source, so the image needs to be able to process tarred content.

Speed:: With S2I, the assemble process can perform a large number of complex operations without creating a new layer at each step, resulting in a fast process. In addition, S2I scripts can be written to re-use artifacts stored in a previous version of the application image, rather than having to download or build them each time the build is run.

Patchability:: S2I allows you to rebuild the application consistently if an underlying image needs a patch due to a security issue.

Operational efficiency:: By restricting build operations instead of allowing arbitrary actions, as a Dockerfile would allow, the PaaS operator can avoid accidental or intentional abuses of the build system.

Operational security:: Building an arbitrary Dockerfile exposes the host system to root privilege escalation. This can be exploited by a malicious user because the entire Docker build process is run as a user with Docker privileges. S2I restricts the operations performed as a root user and can run the scripts as a non-root user.

User efficiency:: S2I prevents developers from performing arbitrary `yum install` type operations, which could slow down development iteration, during their application build.

Ecosystem:: S2I encourages a shared ecosystem of images where you can leverage best practices for your applications.

Reproducibility:: Produced images can include all inputs including specific versions of build tools and dependencies. This ensures that the image can be reproduced precisely.

[id="builds-strategy-s2i-incremental-builds_{context}"]
= Performing source-to-image incremental builds

Source-to-image (S2I) can perform incremental builds, which means it reuses artifacts from previously-built images.

.Procedure

* To create an incremental build, apply the following modification to the strategy definition:
+
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "incremental-image:latest" <1>
    incremental: true <2>
----
<1> Specify an image that supports incremental builds. Consult the documentation of the builder image to determine if it supports this behavior.
<2> This flag controls whether an incremental build is attempted. If the builder image does not support incremental builds, the build will still succeed, but you will get a log message stating the incremental build was not successful because of a missing `save-artifacts` script.

[id="builds-strategy-s2i-override-builder-image-scripts_{context}"]
= Overriding source-to-image builder image scripts

You can override the `assemble`, `run`, and `save-artifacts` source-to-image (S2I) scripts provided by the builder image.

.Procedure

To override the `assemble`, `run`, and `save-artifacts` S2I scripts provided by the builder image, either:

* Provide an `assemble`, `run`, or `save-artifacts` script in the `.s2i/bin` directory of your application source repository.
* Provide a URL of a directory containing the scripts as part of the strategy definition. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "builder-image:latest"
    scripts: "http://somehost.com/scripts_directory" <1>
----
<1> This path will have `run`, `assemble`, and `save-artifacts` appended to it. If any or all scripts are found they will be used in place of the same named scripts provided in the image.

[NOTE]

[id="builds-strategy-s2i-environment-variables_{context}"]
= Source-to-image environment variables

There are two ways to make environment variables available to the source build process and resulting image. Environment files and BuildConfig environment values. Variables provided will be present during the build process and in the output image.

// Module included in the following assemblies:

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-strategy-s2i-environment-files_{context}"]
= Using source-to-image environment files

Source build enables you to set environment values, one per line, inside your application, by specifying them in a `.s2i/environment` file in the source repository. The environment variables specified in this file are present during the build process and in the output image.

If you provide a `.s2i/environment` file in your source repository, source-to-image (S2I) reads this file during the build. This allows customization of the build behavior as the `assemble` script may use these variables.

.Procedure

For example, to disable assets compilation for your Rails application during the build:

* Add `DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION=true` in the `.s2i/environment` file.

In addition to builds, the specified environment variables are also available in the running application itself. For example, to cause the Rails application to start in `development` mode instead of `production`:

* Add `RAILS_ENV=development` to the `.s2i/environment` file.


The complete list of supported environment variables is available in the using images section for each image.

You can add environment variables to the `sourceStrategy` definition of the build configuration. The environment variables defined there are visible during the `assemble` script execution and will be defined in the output image, making them also available to the `run` script and application code.

.Procedure

* For example, to disable assets compilation for your Rails application:

= Creating images from source code with source-to-image

Source-to-image (S2I) is a framework that makes it easy to write images that take application source code as an input and produce a new image that runs the assembled application as output.

The main advantage of using S2I for building reproducible container images is the ease of use for developers. As a builder image author, you must understand two basic concepts in order for your images to provide the best S2I performance, the build process and S2I scripts.

[id="images-create-s2i-build_{context}"]
= Understanding the source-to-image build process

The build process consists of the following three fundamental elements, which are combined into a final container image:

* Sources
* Source-to-image (S2I) scripts
* Builder image

S2I generates a Dockerfile with the builder image as the first `FROM` instruction. The Dockerfile generated by S2I is then passed to Buildah.

[id="images-create-s2i-scripts_{context}"]
= How to write source-to-image scripts

You can write source-to-image (S2I) scripts in any programming language, as long as the scripts are executable inside the builder image. S2I supports multiple options providing `assemble`/`run`/`save-artifacts` scripts. All of these locations are checked on each build in the following order:

. A script specified in the build configuration.
. A script found in the application source `.s2i/bin` directory.
. A script found at the default image URL with the `io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url` label.

Both the `io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url` label specified in the image and the script specified in a build configuration can take one of the following forms:

* `image:///path_to_scripts_dir`: absolute path inside the image to a directory where the S2I scripts are located.
* `$$file:///path_to_scripts_dir$$`: relative or absolute path to a directory on the host where the S2I scripts are located.
* `http(s)://path_to_scripts_dir`: URL to a directory where the S2I scripts are located.

.S2I scripts
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Script |Description

|`assemble`
|The `assemble` script builds the application artifacts from a source and places them into appropriate directories inside the image. This script is required. The workflow for this script is:

. Optional: Restore build artifacts. If you want to support incremental builds, make sure to define `save-artifacts` as well.
. Place the application source in the desired location.
. Build the application artifacts.
. Install the artifacts into locations appropriate for them to run.

|`run`
|The `run` script executes your application. This script is required.

|`save-artifacts`
|The `save-artifacts` script gathers all dependencies that can speed up the build processes that follow. This script is optional. For example:

* For Ruby, `gems` installed by Bundler.
* For Java, `.m2` contents.

These dependencies are gathered into a `tar` file and streamed to the standard output.

|`usage`
|The `usage` script allows you to inform the user how to properly use your image. This script is optional.

|`test/run`
|The `test/run` script allows you to create a process to check if the image is working correctly. This script is optional. The proposed flow of that process is:

. Build the image.
. Run the image to verify the `usage` script.
. Run `s2i build` to verify the `assemble` script.
. Optional: Run `s2i build` again to verify the `save-artifacts` and `assemble` scripts save and restore artifacts functionality.
. Run the image to verify the test application is working.

[NOTE]
====
The suggested location to put the test application built by your `test/run` script is the `test/test-app` directory in your image repository.
====
|===

*Example S2I scripts*

The following example S2I scripts are written in Bash. Each example assumes its `tar` contents are unpacked into the `/tmp/s2i` directory.

.`assemble` script:
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

# restore build artifacts

[id="builds-using-build-volumes_{context}"]
= Using build volumes

You can mount build volumes to give running builds access to information that you don't want to persist in the output container image.

Build volumes provide sensitive information, such as repository credentials, that the build environment or configuration only needs at build time. Build volumes are different from xref:../../cicd/builds/creating-build-inputs.adoc#builds-define-build-inputs_creating-build-inputs[build inputs], whose data can persist in the output container image.

The mount points of build volumes, from which the running build reads data, are functionally similar to link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/[pod volume mounts].

.Prerequisites
* You have xref:../../cicd/builds/creating-build-inputs.adoc#builds-input-secrets-configmaps_creating-build-inputs[added an input secret, config map, or both to a BuildConfig object].

.Procedure



* In the `sourceStrategy` definition of the `BuildConfig` object, add any build volumes to the `volumes` array. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  sourceStrategy:
    volumes:
      - name: secret-mvn <1>
        mounts:
        - destinationPath: /opt/app-root/src/.ssh <2>

      - name: settings-mvn <1>
        mounts:
        - destinationPath: /opt/app-root/src/.m2 <2>
        source:
          type: ConfigMap <3>
          configMap:
            name: my-config <4>
      - name: my-csi-volume <1>

            readOnly: true <6>
            volumeAttributes: <7>
              attribute: value
----

<1> Required. A unique name.
<2> Required. The absolute path of the mount point. It must not contain `..` or `:` and doesn't collide with the destination path generated by the builder. The `/opt/app-root/src` is the default home directory for many Red Hat S2I-enabled images.
<3> Required. The type of source, `ConfigMap`, `Secret`, or `CSI`.
<4> Required. The name of the source.
<5> Required. The driver that provides the ephemeral CSI volume.
<6> Required. This value must be set to `true`. Provides a read-only volume.
<7> Optional. The volume attributes of the ephemeral CSI volume. Consult the CSI driver's documentation for supported attribute keys and values.

The custom build strategy allows developers to define a specific builder image responsible for the entire build process. Using your own builder image allows you to customize your build process.

A custom builder image is a plain container image embedded with build process logic, for example for building RPMs or base images.

Custom builds run with a high level of privilege and are not available to users by default. Only users who can be trusted with cluster administration permissions should be granted access to run custom builds.

= Using custom builder images

{product-title}'s custom build strategy enables you to define a specific builder image responsible for the entire build process. When you need a build to produce individual artifacts such as packages, JARs, WARs, installable ZIPs, or base images, use a custom builder image using the custom build strategy.

A custom builder image is a plain container image embedded with build process logic, which is used for building artifacts such as RPMs or base container images.

Additionally, the custom builder allows implementing any extended build process, such as a CI/CD flow that runs unit or integration tests.

[id="images-custom-builder-image-ref_{context}"]
== Custom builder image

Upon invocation, a custom builder image receives the following environment variables with the information needed to proceed with the build:

.Custom Builder Environment Variables
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description

|`BUILD`
|The entire serialized JSON of the `Build` object definition. If you must use a specific API version for serialization, you can set the `buildAPIVersion` parameter in the custom strategy specification of the build configuration.

|`SOURCE_REPOSITORY`
|The URL of a Git repository with source to be built.

|`SOURCE_URI`
|Uses the same value as `SOURCE_REPOSITORY`. Either can be used.

|`SOURCE_CONTEXT_DIR`
|Specifies the subdirectory of the Git repository to be used when building. Only present if defined.

|`SOURCE_REF`
|The Git reference to be built.

|`ORIGIN_VERSION`
|The version of the {product-title} master that created this build object.

|`OUTPUT_REGISTRY`
|The container image registry to push the image to.

|`OUTPUT_IMAGE`
|The container image tag name for the image being built.

|`PUSH_DOCKERCFG_PATH`
|The path to the container registry credentials for running a `podman push`  operation.

[id="images-custom-builder-flow_{context}"]
== Custom builder workflow

Although custom builder image authors have flexibility in defining the build process, your builder image must adhere to the following required steps necessary for running a build inside of {product-title}:

. The `Build` object definition contains all the necessary information about input parameters for the build.
. Run the build process.
. If your build produces an image, push it to the output location of the build if it is defined. Other output locations can be passed with environment variables.

====

Pipelines give you control over building, deploying, and promoting your applications on {product-title}. Using a combination of the Jenkins Pipeline build strategy, `jenkinsfiles`, and the {product-title} Domain Specific Language (DSL) provided by the Jenkins Client Plugin, you can create advanced build, test, deploy, and promote pipelines for any scenario.

*{product-title} Jenkins Sync Plugin*

The {product-title} Jenkins Sync Plugin keeps the build configuration and build objects in sync with Jenkins jobs and builds, and provides the following:

 * Dynamic job and run creation in Jenkins.
 * Dynamic creation of agent pod templates from image streams, image stream tags, or config maps.
 * Injection of environment variables.
 * Pipeline visualization in the {product-title} web console.
 * Integration with the Jenkins Git plugin, which passes commit information from {product-title} builds to the Jenkins Git plugin.
 * Synchronization of secrets into Jenkins credential entries.

*{product-title} Jenkins Client Plugin*

The {product-title} Jenkins Client Plugin is a Jenkins plugin which aims to provide a readable, concise, comprehensive, and fluent Jenkins Pipeline syntax for rich interactions with an {product-title} API Server. The plugin uses the {product-title} command line tool, `oc`, which must be available on the nodes executing the script.

The Jenkins Client Plugin must be installed on your Jenkins master so the {product-title} DSL will be available to use within the `jenkinsfile` for your application. This plugin is installed and enabled by default when using the {product-title} Jenkins image.

For {product-title} Pipelines within your project, you will must use the Jenkins Pipeline Build Strategy. This strategy defaults to using a `jenkinsfile` at the root of your source repository, but also provides the following configuration options:

* An inline `jenkinsfile` field within your build configuration.
* A `jenkinsfilePath` field within your build configuration that references the location of the `jenkinsfile` to use relative to the source `contextDir`.

[NOTE]
====
The optional `jenkinsfilePath` field specifies the name of the file to use, relative to the source `contextDir`. If `contextDir` is omitted, it defaults to the root of the repository. If `jenkinsfilePath` is omitted, it defaults to `jenkinsfile`.

Jenkins images on {product-title} are fully supported and users should follow Jenkins user documentation for defining their `jenkinsfile` in a job or store it in a Source Control Management system.
====

The `jenkinsfile` uses the standard groovy language syntax to allow fine grained control over the configuration, build, and deployment of your application.

You can supply the `jenkinsfile` in one of the following ways:

* A file located within your source code repository.
* Embedded as part of your build configuration using the `jenkinsfile` field.

When using the first option, the `jenkinsfile` must be included in your applications source code repository at one of the following locations:

* A file named `jenkinsfile` at the root of your repository.
* A file named `jenkinsfile` at the root of the source `contextDir` of your repository.
* A file name specified via the `jenkinsfilePath` field of the `JenkinsPipelineStrategy` section of your BuildConfig, which is relative to the source `contextDir` if supplied, otherwise it defaults to the root of the repository.

The `jenkinsfile` is run on the Jenkins agent pod, which must have the
{product-title} client binaries available if you intend to use the {product-title} DSL.

.Procedure

To provide the Jenkins file, you can either:

* Embed the Jenkins file in the build configuration.
* Include in the build configuration a reference to the Git repository that contains the Jenkins file.

[id="builds-strategy-pipeline-mapping-buildconfig-jenkins_{context}"]
= Mapping between BuildConfig environment variables and Jenkins job parameters

When a Jenkins job is created or updated based on changes to a Pipeline strategy build configuration, any environment variables in the build configuration are mapped to Jenkins job parameters definitions, where the default values for the Jenkins job parameters definitions are the current values of the associated environment variables.

After the Jenkins job's initial creation, you can still add additional parameters to the job from the Jenkins console. The parameter names differ from the names of the environment variables in the build configuration. The parameters are honored when builds are started for those Jenkins jobs.

How you start builds for the Jenkins job dictates how the parameters are set.

* If you start with `oc start-build`, the values of the environment variables in the build configuration are the parameters set for the corresponding job instance. Any changes you make to the parameters' default values from the Jenkins console are ignored. The build configuration values take precedence.

* If you start with `oc start-build -e`, the values for the environment variables specified in the `-e` option take precedence.
** If you specify an environment variable not listed in the build configuration, they will be added as a Jenkins job parameter definitions.
** Any changes you make from the Jenkins console to the parameters corresponding to the environment variables are ignored. The build configuration and what you specify with `oc start-build -e` takes precedence.

* If you start the Jenkins job with the Jenkins console, then you can control the setting of the parameters with the Jenkins console as part of starting a build for the job.

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended that you specify in the build configuration all possible environment variables to be associated with job parameters. Doing so reduces disk I/O and improves performance during Jenkins processing.

Alternatively, you can start your pipeline with the {product-title} web console by navigating to the Builds -> Pipeline section and clicking *Start Pipeline*, or by visiting the Jenkins Console, navigating to the Pipeline that you created, and clicking *Build Now*.
====
+
Once the pipeline is started, you should see the following actions performed within your project:
+
* A job instance is created on the Jenkins server.
* An agent pod is launched, if your pipeline requires one.
* The pipeline runs on the agent pod, or the master if no agent is required.
** Any previously created resources with the `template=nodejs-mongodb-example` label will be deleted.
** A new application, and all of its associated resources, will be created from the `nodejs-mongodb-example` template.
** A build will be started using the `nodejs-mongodb-example` `BuildConfig`.
*** The pipeline will wait until the build has completed to trigger the next stage.
** A deployment will be started using the `nodejs-mongodb-example` deployment configuration.
*** The pipeline will wait until the deployment has completed to trigger the next stage.
** If the build and deploy are successful, the `nodejs-mongodb-example:latest` image will be tagged as `nodejs-mongodb-example:stage`.
* The agent pod is deleted, if one was required for the pipeline.
+
[NOTE]
====
The best way to visualize the pipeline execution is by viewing it in the {product-title} web console. You can view your pipelines by logging in to the web console and navigating to Builds -> Pipelines.

With {product-title} {product-version}, a docker socket will not be present on the host
nodes. This means the _mount docker socket_ option of a custom build is not
guaranteed to provide an accessible docker socket for use within a custom build
image.

If you require this capability in order to build and push images, add the Buildah
tool your custom build image and use it to build and push the image within your
custom build logic. The following is an example of how to run custom builds with
Buildah.

[NOTE]
====
Using the custom build strategy requires permissions that normal users do
not have by default because it allows the user to execute arbitrary code inside
a privileged container running on the cluster. This level of access can be used
to compromise the cluster and therefore should be granted only to users who are
trusted with administrative privileges on the cluster.
====

== Prerequisites

* Review how to xref:../../cicd/builds/securing-builds-by-strategy.adoc#securing-builds-by-strategy[grant custom build permissions].

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-create-custom-build-artifacts_{context}"]
= Creating custom build artifacts

You must create the image you want to use as your custom build image.

.Procedure

. Starting with an empty directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:
+
[source,terminal]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel8/buildah
# In this example, `/tmp/build` contains the inputs that build when this
# custom builder image is run. Normally the custom builder image fetches
# this content from some location at build time, by using git clone as an example.
ADD dockerfile.sample /tmp/input/Dockerfile
ADD build.sh /usr/bin
RUN chmod a+x /usr/bin/build.sh
# /usr/bin/build.sh contains the actual custom build logic that will be run when
# this custom builder image is run.
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/build.sh"]
----

. In the same directory, create a file named `dockerfile.sample`. This file is included in the custom build image and defines the image that is produced by the custom build:
+
[source,terminal]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi
RUN touch /tmp/build
----

. In the same directory, create a file named `build.sh`. This file contains the logic that is run when the custom build runs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
#!/bin/sh
# Note that in this case the build inputs are part of the custom builder image, but normally this
# is retrieved from an external source.
cd /tmp/input
# OUTPUT_REGISTRY and OUTPUT_IMAGE are env variables provided by the custom
# build framework
TAG="${OUTPUT_REGISTRY}/${OUTPUT_IMAGE}"


# performs the build of the new image defined by dockerfile.sample
buildah --storage-driver vfs bud --isolation chroot -t ${TAG} .


# buildah requires a slight modification to the push secret provided by the service
# account to use it for pushing the image
cp /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/push/.dockercfg /tmp
(echo "{ \"auths\": " ; cat /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/push/.dockercfg ; echo "}") > /tmp/.dockercfg


# push the new image to the target for the build
buildah --storage-driver vfs push --tls-verify=false --authfile /tmp/.dockercfg ${TAG}

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-build-custom-builder-image_{context}"]
= Build custom builder image

You can use {product-title} to build and push custom builder images to use in a custom strategy.

.Prerequisites

* Define all the inputs that will go into creating your new custom builder image.

.Procedure

. Define a `BuildConfig` object that will build your custom builder image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-build --binary --strategy=docker --name custom-builder-image
----

. From the directory in which you created your custom build image, run the build:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc start-build custom-builder-image --from-dir . -F
----
+
After the build completes, your new custom builder image is available in your project in an image stream tag that is named `custom-builder-image:latest`.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-use-custom-builder-image_{context}"]
= Use custom builder image

You can define a `BuildConfig` object that uses the custom strategy in conjunction with your custom builder image to execute your custom build logic.

.Prerequisites

* Define all the required inputs for new custom builder image.
* Build your custom builder image.

.Procedure

. Create a file named `buildconfig.yaml`. This file defines the `BuildConfig` object that is created in your project and executed:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: BuildConfig
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: sample-custom-build
  labels:
    name: sample-custom-build
  annotations:
    template.alpha.openshift.io/wait-for-ready: 'true'
spec:
  strategy:
    type: Custom
    customStrategy:
      forcePull: true
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: custom-builder-image:latest
        namespace: <yourproject> <1>
  output:
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: sample-custom:latest
----
<1> Specify your project name.

. Create the `BuildConfig`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f buildconfig.yaml
----

. Create a file named `imagestream.yaml`. This file defines the image stream to which the build will push the image:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ImageStream
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: sample-custom
spec: {}
----

. Create the imagestream:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f imagestream.yaml
----

. Run your custom build:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc start-build sample-custom-build -F
----
+
When the build runs, it launches a pod running the custom builder image that was built earlier. The pod runs the `build.sh` logic that is defined as the entrypoint for the custom builder image. The `build.sh` logic invokes Buildah to build the `dockerfile.sample` that was embedded in the custom builder image, and then uses Buildah to push the new image to the `sample-custom image stream`.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-basic-start-source_{context}"]
= Starting a build with source

Rather than relying on a Git source pull
or a Dockerfile
for a build, you can also start a build by directly pushing your source, which could be the contents of a Git or SVN working directory, a set of pre-built binary artifacts you want to deploy, or a single file. This can be done by specifying one of the following options for the `start-build` command:

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|Option |Description

|`--from-dir=<directory>`
|Specifies a directory that will be archived and used as a binary input for the build.

|`--from-file=<file>`
|Specifies a single file that will be the only file in the build source. The file is placed in the root of an empty directory with the same file name as the original file provided.

|`--from-repo=<local_source_repo>`
|Specifies a path to a local repository to use as the binary input for a build. Add the `--commit` option to control which branch, tag, or commit is used for the build.
|===

When passing any of these options directly to the build, the contents are streamed to the build and override the current build source settings.

[NOTE]
====
Builds triggered from binary input will not preserve the source on the server, so rebuilds triggered by base image changes will use the source specified in the build configuration.
====

.Procedure

* Start a build from a source using the following command to send the contents of a local Git repository as an archive from the tag `v2`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc start-build hello-world --from-repo=../hello-world --commit=v2

[id="builds-basic-edit-buildconfig_{context}"]
= Editing a BuildConfig

To edit your build configurations, you use the *Edit BuildConfig* option in the *Builds* view of the *Developer* perspective.

You can use either of the following views to edit a `BuildConfig`:

* The *Form view* enables you to edit your `BuildConfig` using the standard form fields and checkboxes.
* The *YAML view* enables you to edit your `BuildConfig` with full control over the operations.

You can switch between the *Form view* and *YAML view* without losing any data. The data in the *Form view* is transferred to the *YAML view* and vice versa.

.Procedure

. In the *Builds* view of the *Developer* perspective, click the menu {kebab} to see the *Edit BuildConfig* option.
. Click *Edit BuildConfig* to see the *Form view* option.
. In the *Git* section, enter the Git repository URL for the codebase you want to use to create an application. The URL is then validated.
* Optional: Click *Show Advanced Git Options* to add details such as:
** *Git Reference* to specify a branch, tag, or commit that contains code you want to use to build the application.
** *Context Dir* to specify the subdirectory that contains code you want to use to build the application.
** *Source Secret* to create a *Secret Name* with credentials for pulling your source code from a private repository.
. In the *Build from* section, select the option that you would like to build from. You can use the following options:
** *Image Stream tag* references an image for a given image stream and tag. Enter the project, image stream, and tag of the location you would like to build from and push to.
** *Image Stream image* references an image for a given image stream and image name. Enter the image stream image you would like to build from. Also enter the project, image stream, and tag to push to.
** *Docker image*: The Docker image is referenced through a Docker image repository. You will also need to enter the project, image stream, and tag to refer to where you would like to push to.
. Optional: In the *Environment Variables* section, add the environment variables associated with the project by using the *Name* and *Value* fields. To add more environment variables, use *Add Value*, or *Add from ConfigMap* and *Secret* .
. Optional: To further customize your application, use the following advanced options:
Trigger::
Triggers a new image build when the builder image changes. Add more triggers by clicking *Add Trigger* and selecting the *Type* and *Secret*.

Secrets::
Adds secrets for your application. Add more secrets by clicking *Add secret* and selecting the *Secret* and *Mount point*.

Policy::
Click *Run policy* to select the build run policy. The selected policy determines the order in which builds created from the build configuration must run.

Hooks::
Select *Run build hooks after image is built* to run commands at the end of the build and verify the image. Add *Hook type*, *Command*, and *Arguments* to append to the command.

. Click *Save* to save the `BuildConfig`.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-basic-access-build-verbosity_{context}"]
= Enabling log verbosity

You can enable a more verbose output by passing the `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` environment variable as part of the `sourceStrategy`
or `dockerStrategy`
in a `BuildConfig`.

[NOTE]
====
An administrator can set the default build verbosity for the entire {product-title} instance by configuring `env/BUILD_LOGLEVEL`. This default can be overridden by specifying `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` in a given `BuildConfig`. You can specify a higher priority override on the command line for non-binary builds by passing `--build-loglevel` to `oc start-build`.
====

Available log levels for source builds are as follows:

[horizontal]
Level 0:: Produces output from containers running the `assemble` script and all encountered errors. This is the default.
Level 1:: Produces basic information about the executed process.
Level 2:: Produces very detailed information about the executed process.
Level 3:: Produces very detailed information about the executed process, and a listing of the archive contents.
Level 4:: Currently produces the same information as level 3.
Level 5:: Produces everything mentioned on previous levels and additionally provides docker push messages.

.Procedure

* To enable more verbose output, pass the `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` environment variable as part of the `sourceStrategy`
or `dockerStrategy`
in a `BuildConfig`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
sourceStrategy:
...
  env:
    - name: "BUILD_LOGLEVEL"
      value: "2" <1>
----
<1> Adjust this value to the desired log level.

toc::[]

The following sections outline how to trigger builds and modify builds using build hooks.

:leveloffset: +1

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * builds/triggering-builds-build-hooks.adoc

[id="builds-triggers_{context}"]
= Build triggers

When defining a `BuildConfig`, you can define triggers to control the circumstances in which the `BuildConfig` should be run. The following build triggers are available:

* Webhook
* Image change
* Configuration change

:leveloffset: 2

:leveloffset: +2

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * builds/triggering-builds-build-hooks.adoc

[id="builds-webhook-triggers_{context}"]
= Webhook triggers

Webhook triggers allow you to trigger a new build by sending a request to the {product-title} API endpoint. You can define these triggers using GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Generic webhooks.

Currently, {product-title} webhooks only support the analogous versions of the push event for each of the Git-based Source Code Management (SCM) systems. All other event types are ignored.

When the push events are processed, the {product-title} control plane host confirms if the branch reference inside the event matches the branch reference in the corresponding `BuildConfig`. If so, it then checks out the exact commit reference noted in the webhook event on the {product-title} build. If they do not match, no build is triggered.

[NOTE]
====
`oc new-app` and `oc new-build` create GitHub and Generic webhook triggers automatically, but any other needed webhook triggers must be added manually. You can manually add triggers by setting triggers.
====

For all webhooks, you must define a secret with a key named `WebHookSecretKey` and the value being the value to be supplied when invoking the webhook. The webhook definition must then reference the secret. The secret ensures the uniqueness of the URL, preventing others from triggering the build. The value of the key is compared to the secret provided during the webhook invocation.

For example here is a GitHub webhook with a reference to a secret named `mysecret`:

[source,yaml]
----
type: "GitHub"
github:
  secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
----

The secret is then defined as follows. Note that the value of the secret is base64 encoded as is required for any `data` field of a `Secret` object.

[source,yaml]
----
- kind: Secret
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: mysecret
    creationTimestamp:
  data:
    WebHookSecretKey: c2VjcmV0dmFsdWUx

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-using-github-webhooks_{context}"]
= Using GitHub webhooks

GitHub webhooks handle the call made by GitHub when a repository is updated. When defining the trigger, you must specify a secret, which is part of the URL you supply to GitHub when configuring the webhook.

Example GitHub webhook definition:

[source,yaml]
----
type: "GitHub"
github:
  secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
----

[NOTE]
====
The secret used in the webhook trigger configuration is not the same as `secret` field you encounter when configuring webhook in GitHub UI. The former is to make the webhook URL unique and hard to predict, the latter is an optional string field used to create HMAC hex digest of the body, which is sent as an `X-Hub-Signature` header.
====

The payload URL is returned as the GitHub Webhook URL by the `oc describe`
command (see Displaying Webhook URLs), and is structured as follows:

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
----

.Prerequisites

* Create a `BuildConfig` from a GitHub repository.

.Procedure

. To configure a GitHub Webhook:

.. After creating a `BuildConfig` from a GitHub repository, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe bc/<name-of-your-BuildConfig>
----
+
This generates a webhook GitHub URL that looks like:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
<https://api.starter-us-east-1.openshift.com:443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
----

.. Cut and paste this URL into GitHub, from the GitHub web console.

.. In your GitHub repository, select *Add Webhook* from *Settings -> Webhooks*.

.. Paste the URL output into the *Payload URL* field.

.. Change the *Content Type* from GitHub's default `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` to `application/json`.

.. Click *Add webhook*.
+
You should see a message from GitHub stating that your webhook was successfully configured.
+
Now, when you push a change to your GitHub repository, a new build automatically starts, and upon a successful build a new deployment starts.
+
[NOTE]
====
link:https://gogs.io[Gogs] supports the same webhook payload format as GitHub. Therefore, if you are using a Gogs server, you can define a GitHub webhook trigger on your `BuildConfig` and trigger it by your Gogs server as well.
====

. Given a file containing a valid JSON payload, such as `payload.json`, you can manually trigger the webhook with `curl`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -H "X-GitHub-Event: push" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X POST --data-binary @payload.json https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
----
+
The `-k` argument is only necessary if your API server does not have a properly
signed certificate.

[NOTE]
====
The build will only be triggered if the `ref` value from GitHub webhook event matches the `ref` value specified in the `source.git` field of the `BuildConfig` resource.

[id="builds-using-generic-webhooks_{context}"]
= Using generic webhooks

Generic webhooks are invoked from any system capable of making a web request. As with the other webhooks, you must specify a secret, which is part of the URL that the caller must use to trigger the build. The secret ensures the uniqueness of the URL, preventing others from triggering the build. The following is an example trigger definition YAML within the `BuildConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
type: "Generic"
generic:
  secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
  allowEnv: true <1>
----
<1> Set to `true` to allow a generic webhook to pass in environment variables.

.Procedure

. To set up the caller, supply the calling system with the URL of the generic
webhook endpoint for your build:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/generic
----
+
The caller must invoke the webhook as a `POST` operation.

. To invoke the webhook manually you can use `curl`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -X POST -k https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/generic
----
+
The HTTP verb must be set to `POST`. The insecure `-k` flag is specified to ignore certificate validation. This second flag is not necessary if your cluster has properly signed certificates.
+
The endpoint can accept an optional payload with the following format:
+
[source,yaml]
----
git:
  uri: "<url to git repository>"
  ref: "<optional git reference>"
  commit: "<commit hash identifying a specific git commit>"
  author:
    name: "<author name>"
    email: "<author e-mail>"
  committer:
    name: "<committer name>"
    email: "<committer e-mail>"
  message: "<commit message>"
env: <1>
   - name: "<variable name>"
     value: "<variable value>"
----
<1> Similar to the `BuildConfig` environment variables, the environment variables defined here are made available to your build. If these variables collide with the `BuildConfig` environment variables, these variables take precedence. By default, environment variables passed by webhook are ignored. Set the `allowEnv` field to `true` on the webhook definition to enable this behavior.

. To pass this payload using `curl`, define it in a file named `payload_file.yaml` and run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" --data-binary @payload_file.yaml -X POST -k https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/generic
----
+
The arguments are the same as the previous example with the addition of a header and a payload. The `-H` argument sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/yaml` or `application/json` depending on your payload format. The `--data-binary` argument is used to send a binary payload with newlines intact with the `POST` request.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} permits builds to be triggered by the generic webhook even if an invalid request payload is presented, for example, invalid content type, unparsable or invalid content, and so on. This behavior is maintained for backwards compatibility. If an invalid request payload is presented, {product-title} returns a warning in JSON format as part of its `HTTP 200 OK` response.

[id="builds-using-image-change-triggers_{context}"]
= Using image change triggers

As a developer, you can configure your build to run automatically every time a base image changes.

You can use image change triggers to automatically invoke your build when a new version of an upstream image is available. For example, if a build is based on a RHEL image, you can trigger that build to run any time the RHEL image changes. As a result, the application image is always running on the latest RHEL base image.

[NOTE]
====
Image streams that point to container images in link:http://docs.docker.com/v1.7/reference/api/hub_registry_spec/#docker-registry-1-0[v1 container registries] only trigger a build once when the image stream tag becomes available and not on subsequent image updates. This is due to the lack of uniquely identifiable images in v1 container registries.
====

.Procedure

. Define an `ImageStream` that points to the upstream image you want to use as a trigger:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: "ImageStream"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "ruby-20-centos7"
----
+
This defines the image stream that is tied to a container image repository located at `_<system-registry>_/_<namespace>_/ruby-20-centos7`. The `<system-registry>` is defined as a service with the name `docker-registry` running in {product-title}.

. If an image stream is the base image for the build, set the `from` field in the build strategy to point to the `ImageStream`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "ruby-20-centos7:latest"
----
+
In this case, the `sourceStrategy` definition is consuming the `latest` tag of the image stream named `ruby-20-centos7` located within this namespace.

. Define a build with one or more triggers that point to `ImageStreams`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
type: "ImageChange" <1>
imageChange: {}
type: "ImageChange" <2>
imageChange:
  from:
    kind: "ImageStreamTag"
    name: "custom-image:latest"
----
<1> An image change trigger that monitors the `ImageStream` and `Tag` as defined by the build strategy's `from` field. The `imageChange` object here must be empty.
<2> An image change trigger that monitors an arbitrary image stream. The `imageChange` part, in this case, must include a `from` field that references the `ImageStreamTag` to monitor.

When using an image change trigger for the strategy image stream, the generated build is supplied with an immutable docker tag that points to the latest image corresponding to that tag. This new image reference is used by the strategy when it executes for the build.

For other image change triggers that do not reference the strategy image stream, a new build is started, but the build strategy is not updated with a unique image reference.

Since this example has an image change trigger for the strategy, the resulting build is:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7:<immutableid>"
----

This ensures that the triggered build uses the new image that was just pushed to the repository, and the build can be re-run any time with the same inputs.

You can pause an image change trigger to allow multiple changes on the referenced image stream before a build is started. You can also set the `paused` attribute to true when initially adding an `ImageChangeTrigger` to a `BuildConfig` to prevent a build from being immediately triggered.

[source,yaml]
----
type: "ImageChange"
imageChange:
  from:
    kind: "ImageStreamTag"
    name: "custom-image:latest"
  paused: true
----

In addition to setting the image field for all `Strategy` types, for custom builds, the `OPENSHIFT_CUSTOM_BUILD_BASE_IMAGE` environment variable is checked.
If it does not exist, then it is created with the immutable image reference. If it does exist, then it is updated with the immutable image reference.

If a build is triggered due to a webhook trigger or manual request, the build that is created uses the `<immutableid>` resolved from the `ImageStream` referenced by the `Strategy`. This ensures that builds are performed using consistent image tags for ease of reproduction.

.Prerequisites

* You have configured multiple image change triggers. These triggers have triggered one or more builds.

.Procedure

. In `buildConfig.status.imageChangeTriggers` to identify the `lastTriggerTime` that has the latest timestamp.
+
This `ImageChangeTriggerStatus`


 Then you use the `name` and `namespace` from that build to find the corresponding image change trigger in `buildConfig.spec.triggers`.

. Under `imageChangeTriggers`, compare  timestamps to identify the latest

.Image change triggers

In your build configuration, `buildConfig.spec.triggers` is an array of build trigger policies, `BuildTriggerPolicy`.

Each `BuildTriggerPolicy` has a `type` field and set of pointers fields. Each pointer field corresponds to one of the allowed values for the `type` field. As such, you can only set `BuildTriggerPolicy` to only one pointer field.

For image change triggers, the value of `type` is `ImageChange`. Then, the `imageChange` field is the pointer to an `ImageChangeTrigger` object, which has the following fields:

* `lastTriggeredImageID`: This field, which is not shown in the example, is deprecated in {product-title} 4.8 and will be ignored in a future release. It contains the resolved image reference for the `ImageStreamTag` when the last build was triggered from this `BuildConfig`.
* `paused`: You can use this field, which is not shown in the example, to temporarily disable this particular image change trigger.
* `from`: You use this field to reference the `ImageStreamTag` that drives this image change trigger. Its type is the core Kubernetes type, `OwnerReference`.

The `from` field has the following fields of note:
** `kind`: For image change triggers, the only supported value is `ImageStreamTag`.
** `namespace`: You use this field to specify the namespace of the `ImageStreamTag`.
** `name`: You use this field to specify the `ImageStreamTag`.

.Image change trigger status

In your build configuration, `buildConfig.status.imageChangeTriggers` is an array of `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` elements. Each `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` element includes the `from`, `lastTriggeredImageID`, and `lastTriggerTime` elements shown in the preceding example.

The `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` that has the most recent `lastTriggerTime` triggered the most recent build. You use its `name` and `namespace` to identify the image change trigger in `buildConfig.spec.triggers` that triggered the build.

The `lastTriggerTime` with the most recent timestamp signifies the `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` of the last build. This `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` has the same `name` and `namespace` as the image change trigger in `buildConfig.spec.triggers` that triggered the build.

[id="builds-build-hooks_{context}"]
= Build hooks

Build hooks allow behavior to be injected into the build process.

The `postCommit` field of a `BuildConfig` object runs commands inside a temporary container that is running the build output image. The hook is run immediately after the last layer of the image has been committed and before the image is pushed to a registry.

The current working directory is set to the image's `WORKDIR`, which is the default working directory of the container image. For most images, this is where the source code is located.

The hook fails if the script or command returns a non-zero exit code or if starting the temporary container fails. When the hook fails it marks the build as failed and the image is not pushed to a registry. The reason for failing can be inspected by looking at the build logs.

Build hooks can be used to run unit tests to verify the image before the build is marked complete and the image is made available in a registry. If all tests pass and the test runner returns with exit code `0`, the build is marked successful. In case of any test failure, the build is marked as failed. In all cases, the build log contains the output of the test runner, which can be used to identify failed tests.

The `postCommit` hook is not only limited to running tests, but can be used for other commands as well. Since it runs in a temporary container, changes made by the hook do not persist, meaning that running the hook cannot affect the final image. This behavior allows for, among other uses, the installation and usage of test dependencies that are automatically discarded and are not present in the final image.

[id="builds-configuring-post-commit-build-hooks_{context}"]
= Configuring post commit build hooks

There are different ways to configure the post build hook. All forms in the following examples are equivalent and run `bundle exec rake test --verbose`.

.Procedure

* Shell script:
+
[source,yaml]
----
postCommit:
  script: "bundle exec rake test --verbose"
----
+
The `script` value is a shell script to be run with `/bin/sh -ic`. Use this when a shell script is appropriate to execute the build hook. For example, for running unit tests as above. To control the image entry point, or if the image does not have `/bin/sh`, use `command` and/or `args`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The additional `-i` flag was introduced to improve the experience working with CentOS and RHEL images, and may be removed in a future release.
====

* Command as the image entry point:
+
[source,yaml]
----
postCommit:
  command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "bundle exec rake test --verbose"]
----
+
In this form, `command` is the command to run, which overrides the image
entry point in the exec form, as documented in the link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint[Dockerfile reference]. This is needed if the image does not have `/bin/sh`, or if you do not want to use a shell. In all other cases, using `script` might be more convenient.

* Command with arguments:
+
[source,yaml]
----
postCommit:
  command: ["bundle", "exec", "rake", "test"]
  args: ["--verbose"]
----
+
This form is equivalent to appending the arguments to `command`.

[NOTE]
====
Providing both `script` and `command` simultaneously creates an invalid build hook.

The following sections provide instructions for advanced build operations including
setting build resources and maximum duration, assigning builds to nodes, chaining
builds, build pruning, and build run policies.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-setting-build-resources_{context}"]
= Setting build resources

By default, builds are completed by pods using unbound resources, such as memory and CPU. These resources can be limited.

.Procedure

You can limit resource use in two ways:

* Limit resource use by specifying resource limits in the default container limits of a project.
* Limit resource use by specifying resource limits as part of the build configuration. ** In the following example, each of the `resources`, `cpu`, and `memory` parameters are optional:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
  name: "sample-build"
spec:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: "100m" <1>
      memory: "256Mi" <2>
----
<1> `cpu` is in CPU units: `100m` represents 0.1 CPU units (100 * 1e-3).
<2> `memory` is in bytes: `256Mi` represents 268435456 bytes (256 * 2 ^ 20).
+
However, if a quota has been defined for your project, one of the following two items is required:
+
*** A `resources` section set with an explicit `requests`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
resources:
  requests: <1>
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "256Mi"
----
<1> The `requests` object contains the list of resources that correspond to the list of resources in the quota.
+
*** A limit range defined in your project, where the defaults from the `LimitRange` object apply to pods created during the build process.
+
Otherwise, build pod creation will fail, citing a failure to satisfy quota.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-setting-maximum-duration_{context}"]
= Setting maximum duration

When defining a `BuildConfig` object, you can define its maximum duration by setting the `completionDeadlineSeconds` field. It is specified in seconds and is not set by default. When not set, there is no maximum duration enforced.

The maximum duration is counted from the time when a build pod gets scheduled in the system, and defines how long it can be active, including the time needed to pull the builder image. After reaching the specified timeout, the build is terminated by {product-title}.

.Procedure

* To set maximum duration, specify `completionDeadlineSeconds` in your `BuildConfig`. The following example shows the part of a `BuildConfig` specifying `completionDeadlineSeconds` field for 30 minutes:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  completionDeadlineSeconds: 1800
----

[NOTE]
====
This setting is not supported with the Pipeline Strategy option.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-assigning-builds-to-nodes_{context}"]
= Assigning builds to specific nodes

Builds can be targeted to run on specific nodes by specifying labels in the `nodeSelector` field of a build configuration. The `nodeSelector` value is a set of key-value pairs that are matched to `Node` labels when scheduling the build pod.

The `nodeSelector` value can also be controlled by cluster-wide default and override values. Defaults will only be applied if the build configuration does not define any key-value pairs for the `nodeSelector` and also does not define an explicitly empty map value of `nodeSelector:{}`. Override values will replace values in the build configuration on a key by key basis.

//See Configuring Global Build Defaults and Overrides for more information.

[NOTE]
====
If the specified `NodeSelector` cannot be matched to a node with those labels, the build still stay in the `Pending` state indefinitely.
====

.Procedure

* Assign builds to run on specific nodes by assigning labels in the `nodeSelector` field of the `BuildConfig`, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
  name: "sample-build"
spec:
  nodeSelector:<1>
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
----
<1> Builds associated with this build configuration will run only on nodes with the `key1=value2` and `key2=value2` labels.

[id="builds-chaining-builds_{context}"]
= Chained builds

For compiled languages such as Go, C, C++, and Java, including the dependencies necessary for compilation in the application image might increase the size of the image or introduce vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

To avoid these problems, two builds can be chained together. One build that produces the compiled artifact, and a second build that places that artifact in a separate image that runs the artifact.

In the following example, a source-to-image (S2I) build is combined with a docker build to compile an artifact that is then placed in a separate runtime image.

[NOTE]
====
Although this example chains a S2I build and a docker build, the first build can use any strategy that produces an image containing the desired artifacts, and the second build can use any strategy that can consume input content from an image.
====

//image::chained-build.png[Chained Build] *Needs update*

The first build takes the application source and produces an image containing a `WAR` file. The image is pushed to the `artifact-image` image stream. The path of the output artifact depends on the `assemble` script of the S2I builder used. In this case, it is output to `/wildfly/standalone/deployments/ROOT.war`.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: artifact-build
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: artifact-image:latest
  source:
    git:
      uri: https://github.com/openshift/openshift-jee-sample.git
      ref: "master"
  strategy:
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: wildfly:10.1
        namespace: openshift
----

The second build uses image source with a path to the WAR file inside the output image from the first build. An inline `dockerfile` copies that `WAR` file into a runtime image.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: image-build
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: image-build:latest
  source:
    dockerfile: |-
      FROM jee-runtime:latest
      COPY ROOT.war /deployments/ROOT.war
    images:
    - from: <1>
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: artifact-image:latest
      paths: <2>
      - sourcePath: /wildfly/standalone/deployments/ROOT.war
        destinationDir: "."
  strategy:
    dockerStrategy:
      from: <3>
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: jee-runtime:latest
  triggers:
  - imageChange: {}
    type: ImageChange
----
<1> `from` specifies that the docker build should include the output of the image from the `artifact-image` image stream, which was the target of the previous build.
<2> `paths` specifies which paths from the target image to include in the current docker build.
<3> The runtime image is used as the source image for the docker build.

The result of this setup is that the output image of the second build does not have to contain any of the build tools that are needed to create the `WAR` file. Also, because the second build contains an image change trigger, whenever the first build is run and produces a new image with the binary artifact, the second build is automatically triggered to produce a runtime image that contains that artifact. Therefore, both builds behave as a single build with two stages.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-build-pruning_{context}"]
= Pruning builds

By default, builds that have completed their lifecycle are persisted indefinitely. You can limit the number of previous builds that are retained.

.Procedure

. Limit the number of previous builds that are retained by supplying a positive integer value for `successfulBuildsHistoryLimit` or `failedBuildsHistoryLimit` in your `BuildConfig`, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
  name: "sample-build"
spec:
  successfulBuildsHistoryLimit: 2 <1>
  failedBuildsHistoryLimit: 2 <2>
----
<1> `successfulBuildsHistoryLimit` will retain up to two builds with a status of `completed`.
<2> `failedBuildsHistoryLimit` will retain up to two builds with a status of `failed`, `canceled`, or `error`.

. Trigger build pruning by one of the following actions:
+
* Updating a build configuration.
* Waiting for a build to complete its lifecycle.

Builds are sorted by their creation timestamp with the oldest builds being pruned first.

[NOTE]
====
Administrators can manually prune builds using the 'oc adm' object pruning command.

[id="builds-build-run-policy_{context}"]
= Build run policy

The build run policy describes the order in which the builds created from the build configuration should run. This can be done by changing the value of the `runPolicy` field in the `spec` section of the `Build` specification.

It is also possible to change the `runPolicy` value for existing build configurations, by:

* Changing `Parallel` to `Serial` or `SerialLatestOnly` and triggering a new build from this configuration causes the new build to wait until all parallel builds complete as the serial build can only run alone.
* Changing `Serial` to `SerialLatestOnly` and triggering a new build causes cancellation of all existing builds in queue, except the currently running build and the most recently created build. The newest build runs next.

= Creating an image stream tag for the Red Hat Universal Base Image

To use Red Hat subscriptions within a build, you create an image stream tag to reference the Universal Base Image (UBI).

To make the UBI available *in every project* in the cluster, you add the image stream tag to the `openshift` namespace. Otherwise, to make it available *in a specific project*, you add the image stream tag to that project.

The benefit of using image stream tags this way is that doing so grants access to the UBI based on the `registry.redhat.io` credentials in the install pull secret without exposing the pull secret to other users. This is more convenient than requiring each developer to install pull secrets with `registry.redhat.io` credentials in each project.

.Procedure

* To create an `ImageStreamTag` in the `openshift` namespace, so it is available to developers in all projects, enter:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc tag --source=docker registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest ubi:latest -n openshift
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create an `ImageStreamTag` in the `openshift` namespace:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  name: ubi

= Adding subscription entitlements as a build secret

Builds that use Red Hat subscriptions to install content must include the entitlement keys as a build secret.

.Prerequisites

You must have access to Red Hat entitlements through your subscription. The entitlement secret is automatically created by the Insights Operator.


[TIP]
====
When you perform an Entitlement Build using {op-system-base-full} 7, you must have the following instructions in your Dockerfile before you run any `yum` commands:

[source,terminal]
----
RUN rm /etc/rhsm-host

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-running-entitled-builds-with-sharedsecret-objects_{context}"]
= Running entitled builds using SharedSecret objects

You can configure and perform a build in one namespace that securely uses RHEL entitlements from a `Secret` object in another namespace.

You can still access RHEL entitlements from OpenShift Builds by creating a `Secret` object with your subscription credentials in the same namespace as your `Build` object. However, now, in {product-title} 4.10 and later, you can access your credentials and certificates from a `Secret` object in one of the {product-title} system namespaces. You run entitled builds with a CSI volume mount of a `SharedSecret` custom resource (CR) instance that references the `Secret` object.

This procedure relies on the newly introduced Shared Resources CSI Driver feature, which you can use to declare CSI Volume mounts in {product-title} Builds. It also relies on the {product-title} Insights Operator.

:FeatureName: Managing machines with the Cluster API
// When including this file, ensure that {FeatureName} is set immediately before
// the include. Otherwise it will result in an incorrect replacement.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[subs="attributes+"]
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].
====
// Undefine {FeatureName} attribute, so that any mistakes are easily spotted
:!FeatureName:

The Shared Resources CSI Driver feature also belongs to the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set, which is a subset of the current Technology Preview features. You can enable the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set on test clusters, where you can fully test them while leaving the features disabled on production clusters. Enabling this feature set cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. This feature set is not recommended on production clusters. See "Enabling Technology Preview features using feature gates" in the following "Additional resources" section.

.Prerequisites

* You have enabled the  `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set by using the feature gates.
* You have a `SharedSecret` custom resource (CR) instance that references the `Secret` object where the Insights Operator stores the subscription credentials.
* You must have permission to perform the following actions:
** Create build configs and start builds.
** Discover which `SharedSecret` CR instances are available by entering the `oc get sharedsecrets` command and getting a non-empty list back.
** Determine if the `builder` service account available to you in your namespace is allowed to use the given `SharedSecret` CR instance. In other words, you can run `oc adm policy who-can use <identifier of specific SharedSecret>` to see if the `builder` service account in your namespace is listed.

[NOTE]
====
If neither of the last two prerequisites in this list are met, establish, or ask someone to establish, the necessary role-based access control (RBAC) so that you can discover `SharedSecret` CR instances and enable service accounts to use `SharedSecret` CR instances.
====

.Procedure

. Grant the `builder` service account RBAC permissions to use the `SharedSecret` CR instance by using `oc apply` with YAML content:
+
[NOTE]
====
Currently, `kubectl` and `oc` have hard-coded special case logic restricting the `use` verb to roles centered around pod security. Therefore, you cannot use `oc create role ...` to create the role needed for consuming `SharedSecret` CR instances.
====
+
.Example `oc apply -f` command with YAML `Role` object definition
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f - <<EOF

toc::[]

Builds in {product-title} are run in privileged containers. Depending on the build strategy used, if you have privileges, you can run builds to escalate their permissions on the cluster and host nodes. And as a security measure, it limits who can run builds and the strategy that is used for those builds. Custom builds are inherently less safe than source builds, because they can execute any code within a privileged container, and are disabled by default. Grant docker build permissions with caution, because a vulnerability in the Dockerfile processing logic could result in a privileges being granted on the host node.

By default, all users that can create builds are granted permission to use the docker and Source-to-image (S2I) build strategies. Users with cluster administrator privileges can enable the custom build strategy, as referenced in the restricting build strategies to a user globally section.

You can control who can build and which build strategies they can use by using an authorization policy. Each build strategy has a corresponding build subresource. A user must have permission to create a build and permission to create on the build strategy subresource to create builds using that strategy. Default roles are provided that grant the create permission on the build strategy subresource.

[id="builds-disabling-build-strategy-globally_{context}"]
= Disabling access to a build strategy globally

To prevent access to a particular build strategy globally, log in as a user with cluster administrator privileges, remove the corresponding role from the `system:authenticated` group, and apply the annotation `rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "false"` to protect them from changes between the API restarts. The following example shows disabling the docker build strategy.

.Procedure

. Apply the `rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate` annotation:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit clusterrolebinding system:build-strategy-docker-binding
----

----
<1> Change the `rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate` annotation's value to `"false"`.

. Remove the role:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group system:build-strategy-docker system:authenticated
----

. Ensure the build strategy subresources are also removed from these roles:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit clusterrole admin
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit clusterrole edit
----

. For each role, specify the subresources that correspond to the resource of the strategy to disable.

[id="builds-restricting-build-strategy-globally_{context}"]
= Restricting build strategies to users globally

You can allow a set of specific users to create builds with a particular strategy.

.Prerequisites

* Disable global access to the build strategy.

.Procedure

* Assign the role that corresponds to the build strategy to a specific user. For
example, to add the `system:build-strategy-docker` cluster role to the user
`devuser`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user system:build-strategy-docker devuser

[WARNING]
====
Granting a user access at the cluster level to the `builds/docker` subresource means that the user can create builds with the docker strategy in any project in which they can create builds.

[id="builds-configuration-parameters_{context}"]
= Build controller configuration parameters

The `build.config.openshift.io/cluster` resource offers the following configuration parameters.

[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`Build`
|Holds cluster-wide information on how to handle builds. The canonical, and only valid name is `cluster`.

`spec`: Holds user-settable values for the build controller configuration.

|`buildDefaults`
|Controls the default information for builds.

`defaultProxy`: Contains the default proxy settings for all build operations, including image pull or push and source download.

You can override values by setting the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables in the `BuildConfig` strategy.

`gitProxy`: Contains the proxy settings for Git operations only. If set, this overrides any proxy settings for all Git commands, such as `git clone`.

Values that are not set here are inherited from DefaultProxy.

`env`: A set of default environment variables that are applied to the build if the specified variables do not exist on the build.

`imageLabels`: A list of labels that are applied to the resulting image. You can override a default label by providing a label with the same name in the `BuildConfig`.

`resources`: Defines resource requirements to execute the build.

|`ImageLabel`
|`name`: Defines the name of the label. It must have non-zero length.

|`buildOverrides`
|Controls override settings for builds.

`imageLabels`: A list of labels that are applied to the resulting image. If you provided a label in the `BuildConfig` with the same name as one in this table, your label will be overwritten.

`nodeSelector`: A selector which must be true for the build pod to fit on a node.

`tolerations`: A list of tolerations that overrides any existing tolerations set on a build pod.

|`BuildList`
|`items`: Standard object's metadata.

= Service certificate generation failure

If your request for access to resources is denied:

Issue::
If a service certificate generation fails with (service's `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error` annotation contains):

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
secret/ssl-key references serviceUID 62ad25ca-d703-11e6-9d6f-0e9c0057b608, which does not match 77b6dd80-d716-11e6-9d6f-0e9c0057b60
----

Resolution::
The service that generated the certificate no longer exists, or has a different `serviceUID`. You must force certificates regeneration by removing the old secret, and clearing the following annotations on the service: `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error` and `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-num`:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret <secret_name>
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate service <service_name> service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate service <service_name> service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-num-
----

[NOTE]
====
The command removing annotation has a `-` after the annotation name to be
removed.

toc::[]

Use the following sections to set up additional certificate authorities (CA) to be trusted by builds when pulling images from an image registry.

The procedure requires a cluster administrator to create a `ConfigMap` and add additional CAs as keys in the `ConfigMap`.

* The `ConfigMap` must be created in the `openshift-config` namespace.
* `domain` is the key in the `ConfigMap` and `value` is the PEM-encoded certificate.
** Each CA must be associated with a domain. The domain format is `hostname[..port]`.
* The `ConfigMap` name must be set in the `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` cluster scoped configuration resource's `spec.additionalTrustedCA` field.
//* No longer needs single PEM bundle

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="configmap-adding-ca_{context}"]
= Adding certificate authorities to the cluster

You can add certificate authorities (CA) to the cluster for use when pushing and pulling images with the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to the public certificates of the registry, usually a `hostname/ca.crt` file located in the `/etc/docker/certs.d/` directory.

.Procedure

. Create a `ConfigMap` in the `openshift-config` namespace containing the trusted certificates for the registries that use self-signed certificates. For each CA file, ensure the key in the `ConfigMap` is the hostname of the registry in the `hostname[..port]` format:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap registry-cas -n openshift-config \
--from-file=myregistry.corp.com..5000=/etc/docker/certs.d/myregistry.corp.com:5000/ca.crt \
--from-file=otherregistry.com=/etc/docker/certs.d/otherregistry.com/ca.crt
----

. Update the cluster image configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch image.config.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"additionalTrustedCA":{"name":"registry-cas"}}}' --type=merge
----

{pipelines-title} is a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution based on Kubernetes resources. It uses Tekton building blocks to automate deployments across multiple platforms by abstracting away the underlying implementation details. Tekton introduces a number of standard custom resource definitions (CRDs) for defining CI/CD pipelines that are portable across Kubernetes distributions.

[NOTE]
====
Because {pipelines-title} releases on a different cadence from {product-title}, the {pipelines-title} documentation is now available as separate documentation sets for each minor version of the product.

The {pipelines-title} documentation is available at link:https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/[].

Documentation for specific versions is available using the version selector drop-down list, or directly by adding the version to the URL, for example, link:https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/1.11[].

In addition, the {pipelines-title} documentation is also available on the Red Hat Customer Portal at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_pipelines/[].


For additional information about the {pipelines-title} life cycle and supported platforms, refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#pipelines[Platform Life Cycle Policy].

toc::[]

{gitops-title} is an Operator that uses Argo CD as the declarative GitOps engine. It enables GitOps workflows across multicluster OpenShift and Kubernetes infrastructure. Using {gitops-title}, administrators can consistently configure and deploy Kubernetes-based infrastructure and applications across clusters and development lifecycles. {gitops-title} is based on the open source project link:https://argoproj.github.io/cd/[Argo CD] and provides a similar set of features to what the upstream offers, with additional automation, integration into Red Hat {OCP} and the benefits of Red Hat’s enterprise support, quality assurance and focus on enterprise security.

[NOTE]
====
Because {gitops-title} releases on a different cadence from {OCP}, the {gitops-title} documentation is now available as separate documentation sets for each minor version of the product.

The {gitops-title} documentation is available at link:https://docs.openshift.com/gitops/[].

Documentation for specific versions is available using the version selector dropdown, or directly by adding the version to the URL, for example, link:https://docs.openshift.com/gitops/1.8[].

In addition, the {gitops-title} documentation is also available on the Red Hat Portal at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_gitops/[].

For additional information about the {gitops-title} life cycle and supported platforms, refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#gitops[Platform Life Cycle Policy].
====

{gitops-title} ensures consistency in applications when you deploy them to different clusters in different environments, such as: development, staging, and production. {gitops-title} organizes the deployment process around the configuration repositories and makes them the central element. It always has at least two repositories:

  . Application repository with the source code
  . Environment configuration repository that defines the desired state of the application

These repositories contain a declarative description of the infrastructure you need in your specified environment. They also contain an automated process to make your environment match the described state.

{gitops-title} uses Argo CD to maintain cluster resources. Argo CD is an open-source declarative tool for the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) of applications. {gitops-title} implements Argo CD as a controller so that it continuously monitors application definitions and configurations defined in a Git repository. Then, Argo CD compares the specified state of these configurations with their live state on the cluster.

Argo CD reports any configurations that deviate from their specified state. These reports allow administrators to automatically or manually resync configurations to the defined state. Therefore, Argo CD enables you to deliver global custom resources, like the resources that are used to configure {OCP} clusters.

[id="key-features"]
== Key features

{gitops-title} helps you automate the following tasks:

* Ensure that the clusters have similar states for configuration, monitoring, and storage
* Apply or revert configuration changes to multiple {OCP} clusters
* Associate templated configuration with different environments
* Promote applications across clusters, from staging to production

toc::[]

{product-title} provides a container image for running Jenkins. This image provides a Jenkins server instance, which can be used to set up a basic flow for continuous testing, integration, and delivery.

The image is based on the Red Hat Universal Base Images (UBI).

{product-title} follows the link:https://jenkins.io/changelog-stable/[LTS] release of Jenkins. {product-title} provides an image that contains Jenkins 2.x.

The {product-title} Jenkins images are available on link:https://quay.io[Quay.io] or link:https://registry.redhat.io[registry.redhat.io].

For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ podman pull registry.redhat.io/ocp-tools-4/jenkins-rhel8:<image_tag>
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these registries or push them into your {product-title} container image registry. Additionally, you can create an image stream that points to the image, either in your container image registry or at the external location. Your {product-title} resources can then reference the image stream.

But for convenience, {product-title} provides image streams in the `openshift` namespace for the core Jenkins image as well as the example Agent images provided for {product-title} integration with Jenkins.

[id="images-other-jenkins-config-customization_{context}"]
== Configuration and customization

You can manage Jenkins authentication in two ways:

* {product-title} OAuth authentication provided by the {product-title} Login plugin.
* Standard authentication provided by Jenkins.

:leveloffset: +2

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * cicd/jenkins/images-other-jenkins.adoc

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="images-other-jenkins-oauth-auth_{context}"]
= {product-title} OAuth authentication

OAuth authentication is activated by configuring options on the *Configure Global Security* panel in the Jenkins UI, or by setting the `OPENSHIFT_ENABLE_OAUTH` environment variable on the Jenkins *Deployment configuration* to anything other than `false`. This activates the {product-title} Login plugin, which retrieves the configuration information from pod data or by interacting with the {product-title} API server.

Valid credentials are controlled by the {product-title} identity provider.

Jenkins supports both browser and non-browser access.

Valid users are automatically added to the Jenkins authorization matrix at log in, where {product-title} roles dictate the specific Jenkins permissions that users have. The roles used by default are the predefined `admin`, `edit`, and `view`. The login plugin executes self-SAR requests against those roles in the project or namespace that Jenkins is running in.

Users with the `admin` role have the traditional Jenkins administrative user permissions. Users with the `edit` or `view` role have progressively fewer permissions.

The default {product-title} `admin`, `edit`, and `view` roles and the Jenkins permissions those roles are assigned in the Jenkins instance are configurable.

When running Jenkins in an {product-title} pod, the login plugin looks for a config map named `openshift-jenkins-login-plugin-config` in the namespace that Jenkins is running in.

If this plugin finds and can read in that config map, you can define the role to Jenkins Permission mappings. Specifically:

 * The login plugin treats the key and value pairs in the config map as Jenkins permission to {product-title} role mappings.
 * The key is the Jenkins permission group short ID and the Jenkins permission short ID, with those two separated by a hyphen character.
 * If you want to add the `Overall Jenkins Administer` permission to an {product-title} role, the key should be `Overall-Administer`.
 * To get a sense of which permission groups and permissions IDs are available, go to the matrix authorization page in the Jenkins console and IDs for the groups and individual permissions in the table they provide.
 * The value of the key and value pair is the list of {product-title} roles the permission should apply to, with each role separated by a comma.
 * If you want to add the `Overall Jenkins Administer` permission to both the default `admin` and `edit` roles, as well as a new Jenkins role you have created, the value for the key `Overall-Administer` would be `admin,edit,jenkins`.


[NOTE]
====
The `admin` user that is pre-populated in the {product-title} Jenkins image with administrative privileges is not given those privileges when {product-title} OAuth is used. To grant these permissions the {product-title} cluster administrator must explicitly define that user in the {product-title} identity provider and assigns the `admin` role to the user.
====

Jenkins users' permissions that are stored can be changed after the users are initially established. The {product-title} Login plugin polls the {product-title} API server for permissions and updates the permissions stored in Jenkins for each user with the permissions retrieved from {product-title}. If the Jenkins UI is used to update permissions for a Jenkins user, the permission changes are overwritten the next time the plugin polls {product-title}.

You can control how often the polling occurs with the `OPENSHIFT_PERMISSIONS_POLL_INTERVAL` environment variable. The default polling interval is five minutes.

The easiest way to create a new Jenkins service using OAuth authentication is to use a template.

Jenkins authentication is used by default if the image is run directly, without using a template.

The first time Jenkins starts, the configuration is created along with the administrator user and password. The default user credentials are `admin` and `password`. Configure the default password by setting the `JENKINS_PASSWORD` environment variable when using, and only when using, standard Jenkins authentication.

The Jenkins server can be configured with the following environment variables:

[options="header"]
|===
| Variable | Definition | Example values and settings

|`OPENSHIFT_ENABLE_OAUTH`
|Determines whether the {product-title} Login plugin manages authentication when logging in to Jenkins. To enable, set to `true`.
|Default: `false`

|`JENKINS_PASSWORD`
|The password for the `admin` user when using standard Jenkins authentication. Not applicable when `OPENSHIFT_ENABLE_OAUTH` is set to `true`.
|Default: `password`

|`JAVA_MAX_HEAP_PARAM`,
`CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT`,
`JENKINS_MAX_HEAP_UPPER_BOUND_MB`
|These values control the maximum heap size of the Jenkins JVM. If
`JAVA_MAX_HEAP_PARAM` is set, its value takes precedence. Otherwise, the maximum heap size is dynamically calculated as `CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT` of the container memory limit, optionally capped at `JENKINS_MAX_HEAP_UPPER_BOUND_MB` MiB.

By default, the maximum heap size of the Jenkins JVM is set to 50% of the container memory limit with no cap.
|`JAVA_MAX_HEAP_PARAM` example setting: `-Xmx512m`

`CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT` default: `0.5`, or 50%

`JENKINS_MAX_HEAP_UPPER_BOUND_MB` example setting: `512 MiB`

|`JAVA_INITIAL_HEAP_PARAM`,
`CONTAINER_INITIAL_PERCENT`
|These values control the initial heap size of the Jenkins JVM. If `JAVA_INITIAL_HEAP_PARAM` is set, its value takes precedence. Otherwise, the initial heap size is dynamically calculated as `CONTAINER_INITIAL_PERCENT` of the dynamically calculated maximum heap size.

By default, the JVM sets the initial heap size.
|`JAVA_INITIAL_HEAP_PARAM` example setting: `-Xms32m`

`CONTAINER_INITIAL_PERCENT` example setting: `0.1`, or 10%

|`CONTAINER_CORE_LIMIT`
|If set, specifies an integer number of cores used for sizing numbers of internal JVM threads.
|Example setting: `2`

|`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`
|Specifies options to apply to all JVMs running in this container. It is not recommended to override this value.
|Default: `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap -Dsun.zip.disableMemoryMapping=true`

|`JAVA_GC_OPTS`
|Specifies Jenkins JVM garbage collection parameters. It is not recommended to override this value.
|Default: `-XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=5 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=10 -XX:GCTimeRatio=4 -XX:AdaptiveSizePolicyWeight=90`

|`JENKINS_JAVA_OVERRIDES`
|Specifies additional options for the Jenkins JVM. These options are appended to all other options, including the Java options above, and may be used to override any of them if necessary. Separate each additional option with a space; if any option contains space characters, escape them with a backslash.
|Example settings: `-Dfoo -Dbar`; `-Dfoo=first\ value -Dbar=second\ value`.

|`JENKINS_OPTS`
|Specifies arguments to Jenkins.
|

|`INSTALL_PLUGINS`
|Specifies additional Jenkins plugins to install when the container is first run or when `OVERRIDE_PV_PLUGINS_WITH_IMAGE_PLUGINS` is set to `true`. Plugins are specified as a comma-delimited list of name:version pairs.
|Example setting: `git:3.7.0,subversion:2.10.2`.

|`OPENSHIFT_PERMISSIONS_POLL_INTERVAL`
|Specifies the interval in milliseconds that the {product-title} Login plugin polls {product-title} for the permissions that are associated with each user that is defined in Jenkins.
|Default: `300000` - 5 minutes

|`OVERRIDE_PV_CONFIG_WITH_IMAGE_CONFIG`
|When running this image with an {product-title} persistent volume (PV) for the Jenkins configuration directory, the transfer of configuration from the image to the PV is performed only the first time the image starts because the PV is assigned when the persistent volume claim (PVC) is created. If you create a custom image that extends this image and updates the configuration in the custom image after the initial startup, the configuration is not copied over unless you set this environment variable to `true`.
|Default: `false`

|`OVERRIDE_PV_PLUGINS_WITH_IMAGE_PLUGINS`
|When running this image with an {product-title} PV for the Jenkins configuration directory, the transfer of plugins from the image to the PV is performed only the first time the image starts because the PV is assigned when the PVC is created. If you create a custom image that extends this image and updates plugins in the custom image after the initial startup, the plugins are not copied over unless you set this environment variable to `true`.
|Default: `false`

|`ENABLE_FATAL_ERROR_LOG_FILE`
|When running this image with an {product-title} PVC for the Jenkins configuration directory, this environment variable allows the fatal error log file to persist when a fatal error occurs. The fatal error file is saved at `/var/lib/jenkins/logs`.
|Default: `false`

|`AGENT_BASE_IMAGE`
|Setting this value overrides the image used for the `jnlp` container in the sample Kubernetes plugin pod templates provided with this image. Otherwise, the image from the `jenkins-agent-base-rhel8:latest` image stream tag in the `openshift` namespace is used.
|Default:
`image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/jenkins-agent-base-rhel8:latest`

|`JAVA_BUILDER_IMAGE`
|Setting this value overrides the image used for the `java-builder` container in the `java-builder` sample Kubernetes plugin pod templates provided with this image. Otherwise, the image from the `java:latest` image stream tag in the `openshift` namespace is used.
|Default:
`image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/java:latest`

= Customizing the Jenkins image through source-to-image

To customize the official {product-title} Jenkins image, you can use the image as a source-to-image (S2I) builder.

You can use S2I to copy your custom Jenkins jobs definitions, add additional plugins, or replace the provided `config.xml` file with your own, custom, configuration.

To include your modifications in the Jenkins image, you must have a Git repository with the following directory structure:

`plugins`::
This directory contains those binary Jenkins plugins you want to copy into Jenkins.

`plugins.txt`::
This file lists the plugins you want to install using the following syntax:

----
pluginId:pluginVersion
----

`configuration/jobs`::
This directory contains the Jenkins job definitions.

`configuration/config.xml`::
This file contains your custom Jenkins configuration.

The contents of the `configuration/` directory is copied to the `/var/lib/jenkins/` directory, so you can also include additional files, such as `credentials.xml`, there.

[id="images-other-jenkins-config-kubernetes_{context}"]
= Configuring the Jenkins Kubernetes plugin

The OpenShift Jenkins image includes the preinstalled link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes plugin for Jenkins] so that Jenkins agents can be dynamically provisioned on multiple container hosts using Kubernetes and {product-title}.

To use the Kubernetes plugin, {product-title} provides an OpenShift Agent Base image that is suitable for use as a Jenkins agent.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} 4.11 moves the OpenShift Jenkins and OpenShift Agent Base images to the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io` so that Red Hat can produce and update the images outside the {product-title} lifecycle. Previously, these images were in the {product-title} install payload and the `openshift4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`.

The OpenShift Jenkins Maven and NodeJS Agent images were removed from the {product-title} 4.11 payload. Red Hat no longer produces these images, and they are not available from the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`. Red Hat maintains the 4.10 and earlier versions of these images for any significant bug fixes or security CVEs, following the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} lifecycle policy].

For more information, see the "Important changes to OpenShift Jenkins images" link in the following "Additional resources" section.
====

The Maven and Node.js agent images are automatically configured as Kubernetes pod template images within the {product-title} Jenkins image configuration for the Kubernetes plugin. That configuration includes labels for each image that you can apply to any of your Jenkins jobs under their `Restrict where this project can be run` setting. If the label is applied, jobs run under an {product-title} pod running the respective agent image.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {product-title} 4.10 and later, the recommended pattern for running Jenkins agents using the Kubernetes plugin is to use pod templates with both `jnlp` and `sidecar` containers. The `jnlp` container uses the {product-title} Jenkins Base agent image to facilitate launching a separate pod for your build. The `sidecar` container image has the tools needed to build in a particular language within the separate pod that was launched. Many container images from the Red Hat Container Catalog are referenced in the sample image streams in the `openshift` namespace. The {product-title} Jenkins image has a pod template named `java-build` with sidecar containers that demonstrate this approach. This pod template uses the latest Java version provided by the `java` image stream in the `openshift` namespace.
====

The Jenkins image also provides auto-discovery and auto-configuration of additional agent images for the Kubernetes plugin.

With the {product-title} sync plugin, on Jenkins startup, the Jenkins image searches within the project it is running, or the projects listed in the plugin's configuration, for the following items:

* Image streams with the `role`  label set to `jenkins-agent`.
* Image stream tags with the `role` annotation set to `jenkins-agent`.
* Config maps with the `role` label set to `jenkins-agent`.

When the Jenkins image finds an image stream with the appropriate label, or an image stream tag with the appropriate annotation, it generates the corresponding Kubernetes plugin configuration. This way, you can assign your Jenkins jobs to run in a pod running the container image provided by the image stream.

The name and image references of the image stream, or image stream tag, are mapped to the name and image fields in the Kubernetes plugin pod template. You can control the label field of the Kubernetes plugin pod template by setting an annotation on the image stream, or image stream tag object, with the key `agent-label`. Otherwise, the name is used as the label.

[NOTE]
====
Do not log in to the Jenkins console and change the pod template configuration. If you do so after the pod template is created, and the {product-title} Sync plugin detects that the image associated with the image stream or image stream tag has changed, it replaces the pod template and overwrites those configuration changes. You cannot merge a new configuration with the existing configuration.

Consider the config map approach if you have more complex configuration needs.
====

When it finds a config map with the appropriate label, the Jenkins image assumes that any values in the key-value data payload of the config map contain Extensible Markup Language (XML) consistent with the configuration format for Jenkins and the Kubernetes plugin pod templates. One key advantage of config maps over image streams and image stream tags is that you can control all the Kubernetes plugin pod template parameters.

[NOTE]
====
Do not log in to the Jenkins console and change the pod template configuration. If you do so after the pod template is created, and the {product-title} Sync plugin detects that the image associated with the image stream or image stream tag has changed, it replaces the pod template and overwrites those configuration changes. You cannot merge a new configuration with the existing configuration.

Consider the config map approach if you have more complex configuration needs.
====

After it is installed, the {product-title} Sync plugin monitors the API server of {product-title} for updates to image streams, image stream tags, and config maps and adjusts the configuration of the Kubernetes plugin.

The following rules apply:

* Removing the label or annotation from the config map, image stream, or image stream tag deletes any existing `PodTemplate` from the configuration of the Kubernetes plugin.
* If those objects are removed, the corresponding configuration is removed from the Kubernetes plugin.
* If you create appropriately labeled or annotated `ConfigMap`, `ImageStream`, or `ImageStreamTag` objects, or add labels after their initial creation, this results in the creation of a `PodTemplate` in the Kubernetes-plugin configuration.
* In the case of the `PodTemplate` by config map form, changes to the config map data for the `PodTemplate` are applied to the `PodTemplate` settings in the Kubernetes plugin configuration. The changes also override any changes that were made to the `PodTemplate` through the Jenkins UI between changes to the config map.

To use a container image as a Jenkins agent, the image must run the agent as an entry point. For more details, see the official https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds#Distributedbuilds-Launchslaveagentheadlessly[Jenkins documentation].

= Jenkins permissions

If in the config map the `<serviceAccount>` element of the pod template XML is the {product-title} service account used for the resulting pod, the service account credentials are mounted into the pod. The permissions are associated with the service account and control which operations against the {product-title} master are allowed from the pod.

Consider the following scenario with service accounts used for the pod, which is launched by the Kubernetes Plugin that runs in the {product-title} Jenkins image.

If you use the example template for Jenkins that is provided by {product-title}, the `jenkins` service account is defined with the `edit` role for the project Jenkins runs in, and the master Jenkins pod has that service account mounted.

The two default Maven and NodeJS pod templates that are injected into the Jenkins configuration are also set to use the same service account as the Jenkins master.

* Any pod templates that are automatically discovered by the {product-title} sync plugin because their image streams or image stream tags have the required label or annotations are configured to use the Jenkins master service account as their service account.
* For the other ways you can provide a pod template definition into Jenkins and the Kubernetes plugin, you have to explicitly specify the service account to use. Those other ways include the Jenkins console, the `podTemplate` pipeline DSL that is provided by the Kubernetes plugin, or labeling a config map whose data is the XML configuration for a pod template.
* If you do not specify a value for the service account, the `default` service account is used.
* Ensure that whatever service account is used has the necessary permissions, roles, and so on defined within {product-title} to manipulate whatever projects you choose to manipulate from the within the pod.

= Creating a Jenkins service from a template

Templates provide parameter fields to define all the environment variables with predefined default values. {product-title} provides templates to make creating a new Jenkins service easy. The Jenkins templates should be registered in the default `openshift` project by your cluster administrator during the initial cluster setup.

The two available templates both define deployment configuration and a service. The templates differ in their storage strategy, which affects whether the Jenkins content persists across a pod restart.

[NOTE]
====
A pod might be restarted when it is moved to another node or when an update of the deployment configuration triggers a redeployment.
====

* `jenkins-ephemeral` uses ephemeral storage. On pod restart, all data is lost. This template is only useful for development or testing.

* `jenkins-persistent` uses a Persistent Volume (PV) store. Data survives a pod restart.

To use a PV store, the cluster administrator must define a PV pool in the {product-title} deployment.

After you select which template you want, you must instantiate the template to be able to use Jenkins.

= Using the Jenkins Kubernetes plugin

In the following example, the `openshift-jee-sample` `BuildConfig` object causes a Jenkins Maven agent pod to be dynamically provisioned. The pod clones some Java source code, builds a WAR file, and causes a second `BuildConfig`, `openshift-jee-sample-docker` to run. The second `BuildConfig` layers the new WAR file into a container image.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} 4.11 removed the OpenShift Jenkins Maven and NodeJS Agent images from its payload. Red Hat no longer produces these images, and they are not available from the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`. Red Hat maintains the 4.10 and earlier versions of these images for any significant bug fixes or security CVEs, following the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} lifecycle policy].

For more information, see the "Important changes to OpenShift Jenkins images" link in the following "Additional resources" section.

= Jenkins memory requirements

When deployed by the provided Jenkins Ephemeral or Jenkins Persistent templates, the default memory limit is `1 Gi`.

By default, all other process that run in the Jenkins container cannot use more than a total of `512 MiB` of memory. If they require more memory, the container halts. It is therefore highly recommended that pipelines run external commands in an agent container wherever possible.

And if `Project` quotas allow for it, see recommendations from the Jenkins documentation on what a Jenkins master should have from a memory perspective. Those recommendations proscribe to allocate even more memory for the Jenkins master.

It is recommended to specify memory request and limit values on agent containers created by the Jenkins Kubernetes plugin. Admin users can set default values on a per-agent image basis through the Jenkins configuration. The memory request and limit parameters can also be overridden on a per-container basis.

You can increase the amount of memory available to Jenkins by overriding the `MEMORY_LIMIT` parameter when instantiating the Jenkins Ephemeral or Jenkins Persistent template.

{product-title} provides a base image for use as a Jenkins agent.

The Base image for Jenkins agents does the following:

* Pulls in both the required tools, headless Java, the Jenkins JNLP client, and the useful ones, including `git`, `tar`, `zip`, and `nss`, among others.
* Establishes the JNLP agent as the entry point.
* Includes the `oc` client tool for invoking command line operations from within Jenkins jobs.
* Provides Dockerfiles for both Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and `localdev` images.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use a version of the agent image that is appropriate for your {product-title} release version. Embedding an `oc` client version that is not compatible with the {product-title} version can cause unexpected behavior.
====

The {product-title} Jenkins image also defines the following sample `java-builder` pod template to illustrate how you can use the agent image with the Jenkins Kubernetes plugin.

The `java-builder` pod template employs two containers:
* A `jnlp` container that uses the {product-title} Base agent image and handles the JNLP contract for starting and stopping Jenkins agents.
* A `java` container that uses the `java` {product-title} Sample ImageStream, which contains the various Java binaries, including the Maven binary `mvn`, for building code.

= Jenkins agent environment variables

Each Jenkins agent container can be configured with the following environment variables.

[options="header"]
|===
| Variable | Definition | Example values and settings

|`JAVA_MAX_HEAP_PARAM`,
`CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT`,
`JENKINS_MAX_HEAP_UPPER_BOUND_MB`
|These values control the maximum heap size of the Jenkins JVM. If `JAVA_MAX_HEAP_PARAM` is set, its value takes precedence. Otherwise, the maximum heap size is dynamically calculated as `CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT` of the container memory limit, optionally capped at `JENKINS_MAX_HEAP_UPPER_BOUND_MB` MiB.

By default, the maximum heap size of the Jenkins JVM is set to 50% of the container memory limit with no cap.
|`JAVA_MAX_HEAP_PARAM` example setting: `-Xmx512m`

`CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT` default: `0.5`, or 50%

`JENKINS_MAX_HEAP_UPPER_BOUND_MB` example setting: `512 MiB`

|`JAVA_INITIAL_HEAP_PARAM`,
`CONTAINER_INITIAL_PERCENT`
|These values control the initial heap size of the Jenkins JVM. If `JAVA_INITIAL_HEAP_PARAM` is set, its value takes precedence. Otherwise, the initial heap size is dynamically calculated as `CONTAINER_INITIAL_PERCENT` of the dynamically calculated maximum heap size.

By default, the JVM sets the initial heap size.
|`JAVA_INITIAL_HEAP_PARAM` example setting: `-Xms32m`

`CONTAINER_INITIAL_PERCENT` example setting: `0.1`, or 10%

|`CONTAINER_CORE_LIMIT`
|If set, specifies an integer number of cores used for sizing numbers of internal
JVM threads.
|Example setting: `2`

|`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`
|Specifies options to apply to all JVMs running in this container. It is not recommended to override this value.
|Default: `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap -Dsun.zip.disableMemoryMapping=true`

|`JAVA_GC_OPTS`
|Specifies Jenkins JVM garbage collection parameters. It is not recommended to override this value.
|Default: `-XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=5 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=10 -XX:GCTimeRatio=4 -XX:AdaptiveSizePolicyWeight=90`

|`JENKINS_JAVA_OVERRIDES`
|Specifies additional options for the Jenkins JVM. These options are appended to all other options, including the Java options above, and can be used to override any of them, if necessary. Separate each additional option with a space and if any option contains space characters, escape them with a backslash.
|Example settings: `-Dfoo -Dbar`; `-Dfoo=first\ value -Dbar=second\ value`

|`USE_JAVA_VERSION`
|Specifies the version of Java version to use to run the agent in its container. The container base image has two versions of java installed: `java-11` and `java-1.8.0`. If you extend the container base image, you can specify any alternative version of java using its associated suffix.
|The default value is `java-11`.

Example setting: `java-1.8.0`

[id="images-other-jenkins-agent-memory_{context}"]
= Jenkins agent memory requirements

A JVM is used in all Jenkins agents to host the Jenkins JNLP agent as well as to run any Java applications such as `javac`, Maven, or Gradle.

By default, the Jenkins JNLP agent JVM uses 50% of the container memory limit for its heap. This value can be modified by the `CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT` environment variable. It can also be capped at an upper limit or overridden entirely.

By default, any other processes run in the Jenkins agent container, such as shell scripts or `oc` commands run from pipelines, cannot use more than the remaining 50% memory limit without provoking an OOM kill.

By default, each further JVM process that runs in a Jenkins agent container uses up to 25% of the container memory limit for its heap. It might be necessary to tune this limit for many build workloads.

= Jenkins agent Gradle builds

Hosting Gradle builds in the Jenkins agent on {product-title} presents additional complications because in addition to the Jenkins JNLP agent and Gradle JVMs, Gradle spawns a third JVM to run tests if they are specified.


The following settings are suggested as a starting point for running Gradle builds in a memory constrained Jenkins agent on {product-title}. You can modify these settings as required.

* Ensure the long-lived Gradle daemon is disabled by adding `org.gradle.daemon=false` to the `gradle.properties` file.
* Disable parallel build execution by ensuring `org.gradle.parallel=true` is not set in the `gradle.properties` file and that `--parallel` is not set as a command line argument.
* To prevent Java compilations running out-of-process, set `java { options.fork = false }` in the `build.gradle` file.
* Disable multiple additional test processes by ensuring `test { maxParallelForks = 1 }` is set in the `build.gradle` file.
* Override the Gradle JVM memory parameters by the `GRADLE_OPTS`, `JAVA_OPTS` or `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variables.
* Set the maximum heap size and JVM arguments for any Gradle test JVM by defining the `maxHeapSize` and `jvmArgs` settings in `build.gradle`, or through the `-Dorg.gradle.jvmargs` command line argument.

= Jenkins agent pod retention

Jenkins agent pods, are deleted by default after the build completes or is stopped. This behavior can be changed by the Kubernetes plugin pod retention setting. Pod retention can be set for all Jenkins builds, with overrides for each pod template. The following behaviors are supported:

* `Always` keeps the build pod regardless of build result.
* `Default` uses the plugin value, which is the pod template only.
* `Never` always deletes the pod.
* `On Failure` keeps the pod if it fails during the build.

You can override pod retention in the pipeline Jenkinsfile:

----
podTemplate(label: "mypod",
  cloud: "openshift",
  inheritFrom: "maven",
  podRetention: onFailure(), <1>
  containers: [
    ...
  ]) {
  node("mypod") {
    ...
  }
}
----
<1> Allowed values for `podRetention` are `never()`, `onFailure()`, `always()`, and `default()`.

[WARNING]
====
Pods that are kept might continue to run and count against resource quotas.

[id="jt-comparison-of-jenkins-and-openshift-pipelines-concepts_{context}"]
= Comparison of Jenkins and {pipelines-shortname} concepts

You can review and compare the following equivalent terms used in Jenkins and {pipelines-shortname}.

== Jenkins terminology
Jenkins offers declarative and scripted pipelines that are extensible using shared libraries and plugins. Some basic terms in Jenkins are as follows:

* *Pipeline*: Automates the entire process of building, testing, and deploying applications by using link:https://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] syntax.
* *Node*: A machine capable of either orchestrating or executing a scripted pipeline.
* *Stage*: A conceptually distinct subset of tasks performed in a pipeline. Plugins or user interfaces often use this block to display the status or progress of tasks.
* **Step**: A single task that specifies the exact action to be taken, either by using a command or a script.

== {pipelines-shortname} terminology
{pipelines-shortname} uses link:https://yaml.org/[YAML] syntax for declarative pipelines and consists of tasks. Some basic terms in {pipelines-shortname} are as follows:

* **Pipeline**: A set of tasks in a series, in parallel, or both.
* **Task**: A sequence of steps as commands, binaries, or scripts.
* **PipelineRun**: Execution of a pipeline with one or more tasks.
* **TaskRun**: Execution of a task with one or more steps.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can initiate a PipelineRun or a TaskRun with a set of inputs such as parameters and workspaces, and the execution results in a set of outputs and artifacts.
====
* **Workspace**: In {pipelines-shortname}, workspaces are conceptual blocks that serve the following purposes:

** Storage of inputs, outputs, and build artifacts.

** Common space to share data among tasks.

** Mount points for credentials held in secrets, configurations held in config maps, and common tools shared by an organization.

+
[NOTE]
====
In Jenkins, there is no direct equivalent of {pipelines-shortname} workspaces. You can think of the control node as a workspace, as it stores the cloned code repository, build history, and artifacts. When a job is assigned to a different node, the cloned code and the generated artifacts are stored in that node, but the control node maintains the build history.
====

== Mapping of concepts
The building blocks of Jenkins and {pipelines-shortname} are not equivalent, and a specific comparison does not provide a technically accurate mapping. The following terms and concepts in Jenkins and {pipelines-shortname} correlate in general:

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="jt-migrating-a-sample-pipeline-from-jenkins-to-openshift-pipelines_{context}"]
= Migrating a sample pipeline from Jenkins to {pipelines-shortname}

You can use the following equivalent examples to help migrate your build, test, and deploy pipelines from Jenkins to {pipelines-shortname}.

== Jenkins pipeline
Consider a Jenkins pipeline written in Groovy for building, testing, and deploying:
[source,groovy,subs="attributes+"]
----
pipeline {
   agent any
   stages {
       stage('Build') {
           steps {
               sh 'make'
           }
       }
       stage('Test'){
           steps {
               sh 'make check'
               junit 'reports/**/*.xml'
           }
       }
       stage('Deploy') {
           steps {
               sh 'make publish'
           }
       }
   }
}
----

== {pipelines-shortname} pipeline

To create a pipeline in {pipelines-shortname} that is equivalent to the preceding Jenkins pipeline, you create the following three tasks:

.Example `build` task YAML definition file
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: myproject-build
spec:
  workspaces:
  - name: source
  steps:
  - image: my-ci-image
    command: ["make"]
    workingDir: $(workspaces.source.path)
----

.Example `test` task YAML definition file
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: myproject-test
spec:
  workspaces:
  - name: source
  steps:
  - image: my-ci-image
    command: ["make check"]
    workingDir: $(workspaces.source.path)
  - image: junit-report-image
    script: |
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      junit-report reports/**/*.xml
    workingDir: $(workspaces.source.path)
----

.Example `deploy` task YAML definition file
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: myprojectd-deploy
spec:
  workspaces:
  - name: source
  steps:
  - image: my-deploy-image
    command: ["make deploy"]
    workingDir: $(workspaces.source.path)
----

You can combine the three tasks sequentially to form a pipeline in {pipelines-shortname}:

.Example: {pipelines-shortname} pipeline for building, testing, and deployment
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1

      workspace: shared-dir
  - name: test

      name: myproject-test
    workspaces:
    - name: source
      workspace: shared-dir

= Migrating from Jenkins plugins to Tekton Hub tasks

You can extend the capability of Jenkins by using link:https://plugins.jenkinsci.org[plugins]. To achieve similar extensibility in {pipelines-shortname}, use any of the tasks available from link:https://hub.tekton.dev[Tekton Hub].

For example, consider the link:https://hub.tekton.dev/tekton/task/git-clone[git-clone] task in Tekton Hub, which corresponds to the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/git/[git plugin] for Jenkins.

[id="jt-extending-openshift-pipelines-capabilities-using-custom-tasks-and-scripts_{context}"]
= Extending {pipelines-shortname} capabilities using custom tasks and scripts

In {pipelines-shortname}, if you do not find the right task in Tekton Hub, or need greater control over tasks, you can create custom tasks and scripts to extend the capabilities of {pipelines-shortname}.

.Example: A custom task for running the `maven test` command
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1

Both Jenkins and {pipelines-shortname} offer capabilities for common CI/CD use cases, such as:

* Compiling, building, and deploying images using Apache Maven
* Extending the core capabilities by using plugins
* Reusing shareable libraries and custom scripts

== Running a Maven pipeline in Jenkins and {pipelines-shortname}

You can use Maven in both Jenkins and {pipelines-shortname} workflows for compiling, building, and deploying images. To map your existing Jenkins workflow to {pipelines-shortname}, consider the following examples:

.Example: Compile and build an image and deploy it to OpenShift using Maven in Jenkins
[source,groovy]
----
#!/usr/bin/groovy
node('maven') {
    stage 'Checkout'
    checkout scm

    stage 'Build'
    sh 'cd helloworld && mvn clean'
    sh 'cd helloworld && mvn compile'

    stage 'Run Unit Tests'
    sh 'cd helloworld && mvn test'

    stage 'Package'
    sh 'cd helloworld && mvn package'

    stage 'Archive artifact'
    sh 'mkdir -p artifacts/deployments && cp helloworld/target/*.war artifacts/deployments'
    archive 'helloworld/target/*.war'

    stage 'Create Image'
    sh 'oc login https://kubernetes.default -u admin -p admin --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true'
    sh 'oc new-project helloworldproject'
    sh 'oc project helloworldproject'
    sh 'oc process -f helloworld/jboss-eap70-binary-build.json | oc create -f -'
    sh 'oc start-build eap-helloworld-app --from-dir=artifacts/'

    stage 'Deploy'
    sh 'oc new-app helloworld/jboss-eap70-deploy.json' }

== Extending the core capabilities of Jenkins and {pipelines-shortname} by using plugins
Jenkins has the advantage of a large ecosystem of numerous plugins developed over the years by its extensive user base. You can search and browse the plugins in the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Plugin Index].

{pipelines-shortname} also has many tasks developed and contributed by the community and enterprise users. A publicly available catalog of reusable {pipelines-shortname} tasks are available in the link:https://hub.tekton.dev/[Tekton Hub].

In addition, {pipelines-shortname} incorporates many of the plugins of the Jenkins ecosystem within its core capabilities. For example, authorization is a critical function in both Jenkins and {pipelines-shortname}. While Jenkins ensures authorization using the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/role-strategy/[Role-based Authorization Strategy] plugin, {pipelines-shortname} uses OpenShift's built-in Role-based Access Control system.

== Sharing reusable code in Jenkins and {pipelines-shortname}
Jenkins link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/[shared libraries] provide reusable code for parts of Jenkins pipelines. The libraries are shared between link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/[Jenkinsfiles] to create highly modular pipelines without code repetition.

Although there is no direct equivalent of Jenkins shared libraries in {pipelines-shortname}, you can achieve similar workflows by using tasks from the link:https://hub.tekton.dev/[Tekton Hub] in combination with custom tasks and scripts.

{product-title} 4.11 moves the OpenShift Jenkins and OpenShift Agent Base images to the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`. It also removes the OpenShift Jenkins Maven and NodeJS Agent images from its payload:

* {product-title} 4.11 moves the OpenShift Jenkins and OpenShift Agent Base images to the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io` so that Red Hat can produce and update the images outside the {product-title} lifecycle. Previously, these images were in the {product-title} install payload and the `openshift4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`.

* {product-title} 4.10 deprecated the OpenShift Jenkins Maven and NodeJS Agent images. {product-title} 4.11 removes these images from its payload. Red Hat no longer produces these images, and they are not available from the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`. Red Hat maintains the 4.10 and earlier versions of these images for any significant bug fixes or security CVEs, following the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} lifecycle policy].

These changes support the {product-title} 4.10 recommendation to use xref:../../cicd/jenkins/images-other-jenkins.adoc#images-other-jenkins-config-kubernetes_images-other-jenkins[multiple container Pod Templates with the Jenkins Kubernetes Plugin].

[id="relocation-of-openshift-jenkins-images_{context}"]
= Relocation of OpenShift Jenkins images

{product-title} 4.11 makes significant changes to the location and availability of specific OpenShift Jenkins images. Additionally, you can configure when and how to update these images.

.What stays the same with the OpenShift Jenkins images?

* The Cluster Samples Operator manages the `ImageStream` and `Template` objects for operating the OpenShift Jenkins images.
* By default, the Jenkins `DeploymentConfig` object from the Jenkins pod template triggers a redeployment when the Jenkins image changes. By default, this image is referenced by the `jenkins:2` image stream tag of Jenkins image stream in the `openshift` namespace in the `ImageStream` YAML file in the Samples Operator payload.
* If you upgrade from {product-title} 4.10 and earlier to 4.11, the deprecated `maven` and `nodejs` pod templates are still in the default image configuration.
* If you upgrade from {product-title} 4.10 and earlier to 4.11, the `jenkins-agent-maven` and `jenkins-agent-nodejs` image streams still exist in your cluster. To maintain these image streams, see the following section, "What happens with the `jenkins-agent-maven` and `jenkins-agent-nodejs` image streams in the `openshift` namespace?"

.What changes in the support matrix of the OpenShift Jenkins image?

Each new image in the `ocp-tools-4` repository in the `registry.redhat.io` registry supports multiple versions of {product-title}. When Red Hat updates one of these new images, it is simultaneously available for all versions. This availability is ideal when Red Hat updates an image in response to a security advisory. Initially, this change applies to {product-title} 4.11 and later. It is planned that this change will eventually apply to {product-title} 4.9 and later.

Previously, each Jenkins image supported only one version of {product-title} and Red Hat might update those images sequentially over time.

.What additions are there with the OpenShift Jenkins and Jenkins Agent Base ImageStream and ImageStreamTag objects?

By moving from an in-payload image stream to an image stream that references non-payload images, {product-title} can define additional image stream tags. Red Hat has created a series of new image stream tags to go along with the existing `"value": "jenkins:2"` and `"value": "image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/jenkins-agent-base-rhel8:latest"` image stream tags present in {product-title} 4.10 and earlier. These new image stream tags address some requests to improve how the Jenkins-related image streams are maintained.

About the new image stream tags:

`ocp-upgrade-redeploy`:: To update your Jenkins image when you upgrade {product-title}, use this image stream tag in your Jenkins deployment configuration. This image stream tag corresponds to the existing `2` image stream tag of the `jenkins` image stream and the `latest` image stream tag of the `jenkins-agent-base-rhel8` image stream. It employs an image tag specific to only one SHA or image digest. When the `ocp-tools-4` image changes, such as for Jenkins security advisories, Red Hat Engineering updates the Cluster Samples Operator payload.

`user-maintained-upgrade-redeploy`:: To manually redeploy Jenkins after you upgrade {product-title}, use this image stream tag in your Jenkins deployment configuration. This image stream tag uses the least specific image version indicator available. When you redeploy Jenkins, run the following command: `$ oc import-image jenkins:user-maintained-upgrade-redeploy -n openshift`. When you issue this command, the {product-title} `ImageStream` controller accesses the `registry.redhat.io` image registry and stores any updated images in the {product-registry}'s slot for that Jenkins `ImageStreamTag` object. Otherwise, if you do not run this command, your Jenkins deployment configuration does not trigger a redeployment.

`scheduled-upgrade-redeploy`:: To automatically redeploy the latest version of the Jenkins image when it is released, use this image stream tag in your Jenkins deployment configuration. This image stream tag uses the periodic importing of image stream tags feature of the {product-title} image stream controller, which checks for changes in the backing image. If the image changes, for example, due to a recent Jenkins security advisory, {product-title} triggers a redeployment of your Jenkins deployment configuration. See "Configuring periodic importing of image stream tags" in the following "Additional resources."


.What happens with the `jenkins-agent-maven` and `jenkins-agent-nodejs` image streams in the `openshift` namespace?

The OpenShift Jenkins Maven and NodeJS Agent images for {product-title} were deprecated in 4.10, and are removed from the {product-title} install payload in 4.11. They do not have alternatives defined in the `ocp-tools-4` repository. However, you can work around this by using the sidecar pattern described in the "Jenkins agent" topic mentioned in the following "Additional resources" section.

However, the Cluster Samples Operator does not delete the `jenkins-agent-maven` and `jenkins-agent-nodejs` image streams created by prior releases, which point to the tags of the respective {product-title} payload images on `registry.redhat.io`. Therefore, you can pull updates to these images by running the following commands:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc import-image jenkins-agent-nodejs -n openshift
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc import-image jenkins-agent-maven -n openshift

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE

[id="customizing-the-jenkins-image-stream-tag_{context}"]
= Customizing the Jenkins image stream tag

To override the default upgrade behavior and control how the Jenkins image is upgraded, you set the image stream tag value that your Jenkins deployment configurations use.

The default upgrade behavior is the behavior that existed when the Jenkins image was part of the install payload. The image stream tag names, `2` and `ocp-upgrade-redeploy`, in the `jenkins-rhel.json` image stream file use SHA-specific image references. Therefore, when those tags are updated with a new SHA, the {product-title} image change controller automatically redeploys the Jenkins deployment configuration from the associated templates, such as `jenkins-ephemeral.json` or `jenkins-persistent.json`.

For new deployments, to override that default value, you change the value of the  `JENKINS_IMAGE_STREAM_TAG` in the `jenkins-ephemeral.json` Jenkins template. For example, replace the `2` in `"value": "jenkins:2"` with one of the following image stream tags:

* `ocp-upgrade-redeploy`, the default value, updates your Jenkins image when you upgrade {product-title}.
* `user-maintained-upgrade-redeploy` requires you to manually redeploy Jenkins by running `$ oc import-image jenkins:user-maintained-upgrade-redeploy -n openshift` after upgrading {product-title}.
* `scheduled-upgrade-redeploy` periodically checks the given `<image>:<tag>` combination for changes and upgrades the image when it changes. The image change controller pulls the changed image and redeploys the Jenkins deployment configuration provisioned by the templates. For more information about this scheduled import policy, see the "Adding tags to image streams" in the following "Additional resources."

[NOTE]
====
To override the current upgrade value for existing deployments, change the values of the environment variables that correspond to those template parameters.
====

.Prerequisites

* You are running OpenShift Jenkins on {product-title} {product-version}.
* You know the namespace where OpenShift Jenkins is deployed.

.Procedure

* Set the image stream tag value, replacing `<namespace>` with namespace where OpenShift Jenkins is deployed and `<image_stream_tag>` with an image stream tag:
+
.Example
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch dc jenkins -p '{"spec":{"triggers":[{"type":"ImageChange","imageChangeParams":{"automatic":true,"containerNames":["jenkins"],"from":{"kind":"ImageStreamTag","namespace":"<namespace>","name":"jenkins:<image_stream_tag>"}}}]}}'
----
+
[TIP]
====
Alternatively, to edit the Jenkins deployment configuration YAML, enter `$ oc edit dc/jenkins -n <namespace>` and update the `value: 'jenkins:<image_stream_tag>'` line.
