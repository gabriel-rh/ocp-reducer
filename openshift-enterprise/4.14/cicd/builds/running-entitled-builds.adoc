[id="builds-create-imagestreamtag_{context}"]
= Creating an image stream tag for the Red Hat Universal Base Image

To use Red Hat subscriptions within a build, you create an image stream tag to reference the Universal Base Image (UBI).

To make the UBI available *in every project* in the cluster, you add the image stream tag to the `openshift` namespace. Otherwise, to make it available *in a specific project*, you add the image stream tag to that project.

The benefit of using image stream tags this way is that doing so grants access to the UBI based on the `registry.redhat.io` credentials in the install pull secret without exposing the pull secret to other users. This is more convenient than requiring each developer to install pull secrets with `registry.redhat.io` credentials in each project.

.Procedure

* To create an `ImageStreamTag` in the `openshift` namespace, so it is available to developers in all projects, enter:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc tag --source=docker registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest ubi:latest -n openshift
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create an `ImageStreamTag` in the `openshift` namespace:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  name: ubi

[id="builds-source-secrets-entitlements_{context}"]
= Adding subscription entitlements as a build secret

Builds that use Red Hat subscriptions to install content must include the entitlement keys as a build secret.

.Prerequisites

You must have access to Red Hat entitlements through your subscription. The entitlement secret is automatically created by the Insights Operator.


[TIP]

When you perform an Entitlement Build using {op-system-base-full} 7, you must have the following instructions in your Dockerfile before you run any `yum` commands:

[source,terminal]
----

// Beginning of "Running entitled builds with SharedSecret objects" section

:leveloffset: +1

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="builds-running-entitled-builds-with-sharedsecret-objects_{context}"]
= Running entitled builds using SharedSecret objects

You can configure and perform a build in one namespace that securely uses RHEL entitlements from a `Secret` object in another namespace.

You can still access RHEL entitlements from OpenShift Builds by creating a `Secret` object with your subscription credentials in the same namespace as your `Build` object. However, now, in {product-title} 4.10 and later, you can access your credentials and certificates from a `Secret` object in one of the {product-title} system namespaces. You run entitled builds with a CSI volume mount of a `SharedSecret` custom resource (CR) instance that references the `Secret` object.

This procedure relies on the newly introduced Shared Resources CSI Driver feature, which you can use to declare CSI Volume mounts in {product-title} Builds. It also relies on the {product-title} Insights Operator.

:FeatureName: Managing machines with the Cluster API
// When including this file, ensure that {FeatureName} is set immediately before
// the include. Otherwise it will result in an incorrect replacement.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[subs="attributes+"]
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].
====
// Undefine {FeatureName} attribute, so that any mistakes are easily spotted
:!FeatureName:

The Shared Resources CSI Driver feature also belongs to the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set, which is a subset of the current Technology Preview features. You can enable the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set on test clusters, where you can fully test them while leaving the features disabled on production clusters. Enabling this feature set cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. This feature set is not recommended on production clusters. See "Enabling Technology Preview features using feature gates" in the following "Additional resources" section.

.Prerequisites

* You have enabled the  `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set by using the feature gates.
* You have a `SharedSecret` custom resource (CR) instance that references the `Secret` object where the Insights Operator stores the subscription credentials.
* You must have permission to perform the following actions:
** Create build configs and start builds.
** Discover which `SharedSecret` CR instances are available by entering the `oc get sharedsecrets` command and getting a non-empty list back.
** Determine if the `builder` service account available to you in your namespace is allowed to use the given `SharedSecret` CR instance. In other words, you can run `oc adm policy who-can use <identifier of specific SharedSecret>` to see if the `builder` service account in your namespace is listed.

[NOTE]
====
If neither of the last two prerequisites in this list are met, establish, or ask someone to establish, the necessary role-based access control (RBAC) so that you can discover `SharedSecret` CR instances and enable service accounts to use `SharedSecret` CR instances.
====

.Procedure

. Grant the `builder` service account RBAC permissions to use the `SharedSecret` CR instance by using `oc apply` with YAML content:
+
[NOTE]
====
Currently, `kubectl` and `oc` have hard-coded special case logic restricting the `use` verb to roles centered around pod security. Therefore, you cannot use `oc create role ...` to create the role needed for consuming `SharedSecret` CR instances.
====
+
.Example `oc apply -f` command with YAML `Role` object definition
