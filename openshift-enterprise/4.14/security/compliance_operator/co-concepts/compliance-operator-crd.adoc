The Compliance Operator in the {product-title} provides you with several Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to accomplish the compliance scans. To run a compliance scan, it leverages the predefined security policies, which are derived from the link:https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content[ComplianceAsCode] community project. The Compliance Operator converts these security policies into CRDs, which you can use to run compliance scans and get remediations for the issues found.

:leveloffset: +1

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * security/compliance_operator/co-concepts/compliance-operator-crd.adoc

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="custom-resource-definitions-workflow_{context}"]
= CRDs workflow

The CRD provides you the following workflow to complete the compliance scans:

. Define your compliance scan requirements
. Configure the compliance scan settings
. Process compliance requirements with compliance scans settings
. Monitor the compliance scans
. Check the compliance scan results

:leveloffset!:

[id="defining-compliance-scan-requirements_{context}"]
== Defining the compliance scan requirements
By default, the Compliance Operator CRDs include `ProfileBundle` and `Profile` objects, in which you can define and set the rules for your compliance scan requirements. You can also customize the default profiles by using a `TailoredProfile` object.

:leveloffset: +2

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * security/compliance_operator/co-concepts/compliance-operator-crd.adoc

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="profile-bundle-object_{context}"]
= ProfileBundle object
When you install the Compliance Operator, it includes ready-to-run `ProfileBundle` objects. The Compliance Operator parses the `ProfileBundle` object and creates a `Profile` object for each profile in the bundle. It also parses `Rule` and `Variable` objects, which are used by the `Profile` object.


.Example `ProfileBundle` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ProfileBundle
  name: <profile bundle name>
  namespace: openshift-compliance
status:
  dataStreamStatus: VALID <1>
----
<1> Indicates whether the Compliance Operator was able to parse the content files.

[NOTE]
====
When the `contentFile` fails, an `errorMessage` attribute appears, which provides details of the error that occurred.
====

.Troubleshooting

When you roll back to a known content image from an invalid image, the `ProfileBundle` object stops responding and displays `PENDING` state. As a workaround, you can move to a different image than the previous one. Alternatively, you can delete and re-create the `ProfileBundle` object to return to the working state.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="profile-object_{context}"]
= Profile object

The `Profile` object defines the rules and variables that can be evaluated for a certain compliance standard. It contains parsed out details about an OpenSCAP profile, such as its XCCDF identifier and profile checks for a `Node` or `Platform` type. You can either directly use the `Profile` object or further customize it using a `TailorProfile` object.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot create or modify the `Profile` object manually because it is derived from a single `ProfileBundle` object. Typically, a single `ProfileBundle` object can include several `Profile` objects.

[id="tailored-profile-object_{context}"]
= TailoredProfile object

Use the `TailoredProfile` object to modify the default `Profile` object based on your organization requirements. You can enable or disable rules, set variable values, and provide justification for the customization. After validation, the `TailoredProfile` object creates a `ConfigMap`, which can be referenced by a `ComplianceScan` object.

[TIP]
====
You can use the `TailoredProfile` object by referencing it in a `ScanSettingBinding` object. For more information about `ScanSettingBinding`, see ScanSettingBinding object.

.Example `TailoredProfile` object
[source,yaml]

  outputRef:
    name: rhcos4-with-usb-tp <3>
    namespace: openshift-compliance
  state: READY <4>
----

<1> This is optional. Name of the `Profile` object upon which the `TailoredProfile` is built. If no value is set, a new profile is created from the `enableRules` list.
<2> Specifies the XCCDF name of the tailored profile.
<3> Specifies the `ConfigMap` name, which can be used as the value of the `tailoringConfigMap.name` attribute of a `ComplianceScan`.
<4> Shows the state of the object such as `READY`, `PENDING`, and `FAILURE`. If the state of the object is `ERROR`, then the attribute `status.errorMessage` provides the reason for the failure.

With the `TailoredProfile` object, it is possible to create a new `Profile` object using the `TailoredProfile` construct. To create a new `Profile`, set the following configuration parameters :

* an appropriate title
* `extends` value must be empty
* scan type annotation on the `TailoredProfile` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
compliance.openshift.io/product-type: Platform/Node
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you have not set the `product-type` annotation, the Compliance Operator defaults to `Platform` scan type. Adding the `-node` suffix to the name of the `TailoredProfile` object results in `node` scan type.
====

:leveloffset!:

[id="configure-compliance-scan-settings_{context}"]
== Configuring the compliance scan settings
After you have defined the requirements of the compliance scan, you can configure it by specifying the type of the scan, occurrence of the scan, and location of the scan. To do so, Compliance Operator provides you with a `ScanSetting` object.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="scan-setting-object_{context}"]
= ScanSetting object
Use the `ScanSetting` object to define and reuse the operational policies to run your scans.
By default, the Compliance Operator creates the following `ScanSetting` objects:

* *default* - it runs a scan every day at 1 AM on both master and worker nodes using a 1Gi Persistent Volume (PV) and keeps the last three results. Remediation is neither applied nor updated automatically.
* *default-auto-apply* - it runs a scan every day at 1AM on both control plane and worker nodes using a 1Gi Persistent Volume (PV) and keeps the last three results. Both `autoApplyRemediations` and `autoUpdateRemediations` are set to true.

[id="process-compliance-requirements-with-compliance-settings_{context}"]
== Processing the compliance scan requirements with compliance scans settings
When you have defined the compliance scan requirements and configured the settings to run the scans, then the Compliance Operator processes it using the `ScanSettingBinding` object.

= ScanSettingBinding object

Use the `ScanSettingBinding` object to specify your compliance requirements with reference to the `Profile` or `TailoredProfile` object. It is then linked to a `ScanSetting` object, which provides the operational constraints for the scan. Then the Compliance Operator generates the `ComplianceSuite` object based on the `ScanSetting` and `ScanSettingBinding` objects.

----

<1> Specify either `Node` or `Platform`. Node profiles scan the cluster nodes and platform profiles scan the Kubernetes platform.
<2> Specify the XCCDF identifier of the profile that you want to run.
<3> Specify the container image that encapsulates the profile files.
<4> It is optional. Specify the scan to run a single rule. This rule has to be identified with the XCCDF ID, and has to belong to the specified profile.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you skip the `rule` parameter, then scan runs for all the available rules of the specified profile.
====
<5> If you are on the {product-title} and wants to generate a remediation, then nodeSelector label has to match the `MachineConfigPool` label.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not specify `nodeSelector` parameter or match the `MachineConfig` label, scan will still run, but it will not create remediation.
====
<6> Indicates the current phase of the scan.
<7> Indicates the verdict of the scan.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you delete a `ComplianceSuite` object, then all the associated scans get deleted.
====

When the scan is complete, it generates the result as Custom Resources of the `ComplianceCheckResult` object. However, the raw results are available in ARF format. These results are stored in a Persistent Volume (PV), which has a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) associated with the name of the scan.
You can programmatically fetch the `ComplianceScans` events. To generate events for the suite, run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
oc get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=ComplianceScan,involvedObject.name=<name of the suite>

== Viewing the compliance results
When the compliance suite reaches the `DONE` phase, you can view the scan results and possible remediations.

[id="compliance-check-result_{context}"]
= ComplianceCheckResult object
When you run a scan with a specific profile, several rules in the profiles are verified. For each of these rules, a `ComplianceCheckResult` object is created, which provides the state of the cluster for a specific rule.

.Example `ComplianceCheckResult` object

<1> Describes the severity of the scan check.
<2> Describes the result of the check. The possible values are:
* PASS: check was successful.
* FAIL: check was unsuccessful.
* INFO: check was successful and found something not severe enough to be considered an error.
* MANUAL: check cannot automatically assess the status and manual check is required.
* INCONSISTENT: different nodes report different results.
* ERROR: check run successfully, but could not complete.
* NOTAPPLICABLE: check did not run as it is not applicable.

= ComplianceRemediation object
For a specific check you can have a datastream specified fix. However, if a Kubernetes fix is available, then the Compliance Operator creates a `ComplianceRemediation` object.

<1> `true` indicates the remediation was applied. `false` indicates the remediation was not applied.
<2> Includes the definition of the remediation.
<3> Indicates remediation that was previously parsed from an earlier version of the content. The Compliance Operator still retains the outdated objects to give the administrator a chance to review the new remediations before applying them.

To get all the remediations from a suite, run the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
oc get complianceremediations \

oc get compliancecheckresults \
-l 'compliance.openshift.io/check-status in (FAIL),compliance.openshift.io/automated-remediation'
----

To list all failing checks that can be remediated manually, run the following command:
