Container registries store container images to:

* Make images accessible to others
* Organize images into repositories that can include multiple versions of an image
* Optionally limit access to images, based on different authentication methods, or
make them publicly available

There are public container registries, such as Quay.io and Docker Hub
where many people and organizations share their images.
The Red Hat Registry offers supported Red Hat and partner images,
while the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog offers detailed descriptions
and health checks for those images.
To manage your own registry, you could purchase a container
registry such as
link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-quay[Red Hat Quay].

From a security standpoint, some registries provide special features to
check and improve the health of your containers.
For example, Red Hat Quay offers container vulnerability scanning
with Clair security scanner, build triggers to automatically rebuild
images when source code changes in GitHub and other locations, and
the ability to use role-based access control (RBAC) to
secure access to images.

= Knowing where containers come from?

There are tools you can use to scan and track the contents of your downloaded
and deployed container images. However, there are many public sources of
container images. When using public container registries, you can add a layer of
protection by using trusted sources.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * security/container_security/security-registries.adoc

[id="security-registries-immutable_{context}"]
= Immutable and certified containers

Consuming security updates is particularly important when managing _immutable
containers_. Immutable containers are containers that will never be changed
while running. When you deploy immutable containers, you do not step into the
running container to replace one or more binaries. From an operational
standpoint, you rebuild and redeploy an updated container image
to replace a container instead of changing it.

Red Hat certified images are:

* Free of known vulnerabilities in the platform components or layers
* Compatible across the {op-system-base} platforms, from bare metal to cloud
* Supported by Red Hat

The list of known vulnerabilities is constantly evolving, so you must track the
contents of your deployed container images, as well as newly downloaded images,
over time. You can use
link:https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/security-advisories[Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs)]
to alert you to any newly discovered issues in
Red Hat certified container images, and direct you to the updated image.
Alternatively, you can go to the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog
to look up that and other security-related issues for each Red Hat image.

[id="security-registries-ecosystem_{context}"]
= Getting containers from Red Hat Registry and Ecosystem Catalog

Red Hat lists certified container images for Red Hat products and partner offerings from the
link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/explore[Container Images]
section of the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog. From that catalog,
you can see details of each image, including CVE, software packages listings, and health
scores.

Red Hat images are actually stored in what is referred to as the _Red Hat Registry_,
which is represented by a public container registry (`registry.access.redhat.com`)
and an authenticated registry (`registry.redhat.io`).
Both include basically the same set of container images, with
`registry.redhat.io` including some additional images that require authentication
with Red Hat subscription credentials.

Container content is monitored for vulnerabilities by Red Hat and updated
regularly. When Red Hat releases security updates, such as fixes to _glibc_,
link:https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/drown[DROWN], or
link:https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/2757141[Dirty Cow],
any affected container images are also rebuilt and pushed
to the Red Hat Registry.

Red Hat uses a `health index` to reflect the security risk for each container provided through
the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog. Because containers consume software provided by Red
Hat and the errata process, old, stale containers are insecure whereas new,
fresh containers are more secure.

To illustrate the age of containers, the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog uses a
grading system. A freshness grade is a measure of the oldest and most severe
security errata available for an image. "A" is more up to date than "F". See
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2803031[Container Health Index grades as used inside the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog] for more details on this grading system.

See the link:https://access.redhat.com/security/[Red Hat Product Security Center]
for details on security updates and vulnerabilities related to Red Hat software.
Check out link:https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/security-advisories[Red Hat Security Advisories]
to search for specific advisories and CVEs.

{product-title} includes the _OpenShift Container Registry_, a private registry
running as an integrated component of the platform that you can use to manage your container
images. The OpenShift Container Registry provides role-based access controls
that allow you to manage who can pull and push which container images.

{product-title} also supports integration with other private registries that you might
already be using, such as Red Hat Quay.

= Storing containers using Red Hat Quay
link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-quay[Red Hat Quay] is an
enterprise-quality container registry product from Red Hat.
Development for Red Hat Quay is done through the upstream
link:https://docs.projectquay.io/welcome.html[Project Quay].
Red Hat Quay is available to deploy on-premise or through the hosted
version of Red Hat Quay at link:https://quay.io[Quay.io].

Security-related features of Red Hat Quay include:

* *Time machine*: Allows images with older tags to expire after a set
period of time or based on a user-selected expiration time.

* *link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#repo-mirroring-in-red-hat-quay[Repository mirroring]*: Lets you mirror
other registries for security reasons, such hosting a public repository
on Red Hat Quay behind a company firewall, or for performance reasons, to
keep registries closer to where they are used.

* *Action log storage*: Save Red Hat Quay logging output to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#proc_manage-log-storage[Elasticsearch storage]
to allow for later search and analysis.

* *link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#quay-security-scanner[Clair security scanning]*: Scan images against a variety of Linux
vulnerability databases, based on the origins of each container image.

* *Internal authentication*: Use the default local database to handle RBAC
authentication to Red Hat Quay or choose from LDAP, Keystone (OpenStack),
JWT Custom Authentication, or External Application Token authentication.

* *External authorization (OAuth)*: Allow authorization to Red Hat Quay
from GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Google Authentication.

* *Access settings*: Generate tokens to allow access to Red Hat Quay
from docker, rkt, anonymous access, user-created accounts, encrypted
client passwords, or prefix username autocompletion.

Ongoing integration of Red Hat Quay with {product-title} continues,
with several {product-title} Operators of particular interest.
The link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#quay-bridge-operator[Quay Bridge Operator]
lets you replace the internal {product-registry} with Red Hat Quay.
The link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#container-security-operator-setup[{rhq-cso}]
lets you check vulnerabilities of images running in {product-title} that were
pulled from Red Hat Quay registries.
