toc::[]

{product-title} and Kubernetes APIs are key to automating container management at scale. APIs are used to:

* Validate and configure the data for pods, services, and replication controllers.
* Perform project validation on incoming requests and invoke triggers on other
major system components.

Security-related features in {product-title} that are based on Kubernetes include:

* Multitenancy, which combines Role-Based Access Controls and network policies
to isolate containers at multiple levels.
* Admission plugins, which form boundaries between an API and those
making requests to the API.

{product-title} uses Operators to automate and simplify the management of
Kubernetes-level security features.

// Multitenancy
:leveloffset: +1

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * security/container_security/security-platform.adoc

[id="security-platform-multi-tenancy_{context}"]
= Isolating containers with multitenancy

Multitenancy allows applications on an {product-title} cluster that are owned
by multiple users, and run across multiple hosts and namespaces,
to remain isolated from each other and from outside attacks.
You obtain multitenancy by applying role-based access control (RBAC)
to Kubernetes namespaces.

In Kubernetes, _namespaces_ are areas where applications can run
in ways that are separate from other applications.
{product-title} uses and extends namespaces by adding extra
annotations, including MCS labeling in SELinux, and identifying
these extended namespaces as _projects_. Within the scope of
a project, users can maintain their own cluster resources,
including service accounts, policies, constraints,
and various other objects.

RBAC objects are assigned to projects to authorize selected users
to have access to those projects. That authorization takes the form
of rules, roles, and bindings:

* Rules define what a user can create or access in a project.
* Roles are collections of rules that you can bind to selected users or groups.
* Bindings define the association between users or groups and roles.

Local RBAC roles and bindings attach a user or group to a
particular project. Cluster RBAC can attach cluster-wide roles and bindings
to all projects in a cluster. There are default
cluster roles that can be assigned to provide `admin`, `basic-user`, `cluster-admin`,
and `cluster-status` access.

:leveloffset!:

// Admission plugins
:leveloffset: +1

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * security/container_security/security-platform.adoc

[id="security-platform-admission_{context}"]
= Protecting control plane with admission plugins

While RBAC controls access rules between users and groups and available projects,
_admission plugins_ define access to the {product-title} master API.
Admission plugins form a chain of rules that consist of:

* Default admissions plugins: These implement a default set of
policies and resources limits that are applied to components of the {product-title}
control plane.

* Mutating admission plugins: These plugins dynamically extend the admission chain.
They call out to a webhook server and can both authenticate a request and modify the selected resource.

* Validating admission plugins: These validate requests for a selected resource
and can both validate the request and ensure that the resource does not change again.

API requests go through admissions plugins in a chain, with any failure along
the way causing the request to be rejected. Each admission plugin is associated with particular resources and only
responds to requests for those resources.

[id="security-deployment-sccs_{context}"]
== Security context constraints (SCCs)

You can use _security context constraints_ (SCCs) to define a set of conditions
that a pod must run with to be accepted
into the system.

Some aspects that can be managed by SCCs include:

- Running of privileged containers
- Capabilities a container can request to be added
- Use of host directories as volumes
- SELinux context of the container
- Container user ID

If you have the required permissions, you can adjust the default SCC policies to
be more permissive, if required.

[id="security-service-account_{context}"]
== Granting roles to service accounts

You can assign roles to service accounts, in the same way that
users are assigned role-based access.
There are three default service accounts created for each project.
A service account:

* is limited in scope to a particular project
* derives its name from its project
* is automatically assigned an API token and credentials to access the
OpenShift Container Registry

Service accounts associated with platform components automatically
have their keys rotated.

:leveloffset!:

// Authentication and authorization
:leveloffset: +1

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * security/container_security/security-platform.adoc

[id="security-platform-authentication_{context}"]
=  Authentication and authorization

[id="security-platform-auth-controlling-access_{context}"]
== Controlling access using OAuth

You can use API access control via authentication and authorization for securing
your container platform. The {product-title} master includes a built-in OAuth
server. Users can obtain OAuth access tokens to authenticate themselves to the
API.

As an administrator, you can configure OAuth to authenticate using an _identity
provider_, such as LDAP, GitHub, or Google. The
identity provider is used by default for new {product-title} deployments, but
you can configure this at initial installation time or postinstallation.

[id="security-platform-api-access-control_{context}"]
== API access control and management

Applications can have multiple, independent API services which have different
endpoints that require management. {product-title} includes a containerized
version of the 3scale API gateway so that you can manage your APIs and control
access.

3scale gives you a variety of standard options for API authentication and
security, which can be used alone or in combination to issue credentials and
control access: standard API keys, application ID and key pair, and OAuth 2.0.

You can restrict access to specific endpoints, methods, and services and apply
access policy for groups of users. Application plans allow you to set rate
limits for API usage and control traffic flow for groups of developers.

For a tutorial on using APIcast v2, the containerized 3scale API Gateway, see
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.0/html/deployment_options/apicast-openshift[Running APIcast on Red Hat OpenShift]
in the 3scale documentation.

[id="security-platform-red-hat-sso_{context}"]
== Red Hat Single Sign-On

The Red Hat Single Sign-On server enables you to secure your
applications by providing web single sign-on capabilities based on standards, including
SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, and OAuth 2.0. The server can act as a SAML or OpenID
Connect–based identity provider (IdP), mediating with your enterprise user
directory or third-party identity provider for identity information and your
applications using standards-based tokens. You can integrate Red Hat Single Sign-On with
LDAP-based directory services including Microsoft Active Directory and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux Identity Management.

[id="security-platform-auth-secure-self-service-web-console_{context}"]
== Secure self-service web console

{product-title} provides a self-service web console to ensure that teams do not
access other environments without authorization. {product-title} ensures a
secure multitenant master by providing the following:

- Access to the master uses Transport Layer Security (TLS)
- Access to the API Server uses X.509 certificates or OAuth access tokens
- Project quota limits the damage that a rogue token could do
- The etcd service is not exposed directly to the cluster

:leveloffset!:

// Managing certificates for the platform
:leveloffset: +1

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * security/container_security/security-platform.adoc

[id="security-platform-certificates_{context}"]
= Managing certificates for the platform

{product-title} has multiple components within its framework that use REST-based
HTTPS communication leveraging encryption via TLS certificates.
{product-title}'s installer configures these certificates during
installation. There are some primary components that generate this traffic:

* masters (API server and controllers)
* etcd
* nodes
* registry
* router

[id="security-platform-config-custom-certs_{context}"]
== Configuring custom certificates

You can configure custom serving certificates for the public hostnames of the
API server and web console during initial installation or when redeploying
certificates. You can also use a custom CA.
