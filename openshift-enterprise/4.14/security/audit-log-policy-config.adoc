You can control the amount of information that is logged to the API server audit logs by choosing the audit log policy profile to use.

[id="about-audit-log-profiles_{context}"]
= About audit log policy profiles

Audit log profiles define how to log requests that come to the OpenShift API server, Kubernetes API server, OpenShift OAuth API server, and OpenShift OAuth server.

{product-title} provides the following predefined audit policy profiles:

[cols="1,2a",options="header"]
|===
|Profile
|Description

|`Default`
|Logs only metadata for read and write requests; does not log request bodies except for OAuth access token requests. This is the default policy.

|`WriteRequestBodies`
|In addition to logging metadata for all requests, logs request bodies for every write request to the API servers (`create`, `update`, `patch`, `delete`, `deletecollection`). This profile has more resource overhead than the `Default` profile. ^[1]^

|`AllRequestBodies`
|In addition to logging metadata for all requests, logs request bodies for  every read and write request to the API servers (`get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `patch`). This profile has the most resource overhead. ^[1]^

|`None`
|No requests are logged; even OAuth access token requests and OAuth authorize token requests are not logged. Custom rules are ignored when this profile is set.

[WARNING]
====
It is not recommended to disable audit logging by using the `None` profile unless you are fully aware of the risks of not logging data that can be beneficial when troubleshooting issues. If you disable audit logging and a support situation arises, you might need to enable audit logging and reproduce the issue in order to troubleshoot properly.
====

|===
[.small]
--
1. Sensitive resources, such as `Secret`, `Route`, and `OAuthClient` objects, are only ever logged at the metadata level. OpenShift OAuth server events are only ever logged at the metadata level.
--

By default, {product-title} uses the `Default` audit log profile. You can use another audit policy profile that also logs request bodies, but be aware of the increased resource usage (CPU, memory, and I/O).

[id="configuring-audit-policy_{context}"]
= Configuring the audit log policy

You can configure the audit log policy to use when logging requests that come to the API servers.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Edit the `APIServer` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit apiserver cluster
----

. Update the `spec.audit.profile` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: APIServer
metadata:
...
spec:
  audit:
    profile: WriteRequestBodies    <1>
----
<1> Set to `Default`, `WriteRequestBodies`, `AllRequestBodies`, or `None`. The default profile is `Default`.
+
[WARNING]
====
It is not recommended to disable audit logging by using the `None` profile unless you are fully aware of the risks of not logging data that can be beneficial when troubleshooting issues. If you disable audit logging and a support situation arises, you might need to enable audit logging and reproduce the issue in order to troubleshoot properly.
====

. Save the file to apply the changes.

.Verification

* Verify that a new revision of the Kubernetes API server pods is rolled out. It can take several minutes for all nodes to update to the new revision.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get kubeapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="NodeInstallerProgressing")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
----
+
Review the `NodeInstallerProgressing` status condition for the Kubernetes API server to verify that all nodes are at the latest revision. The output shows `AllNodesAtLatestRevision` upon successful update:
+
[source,terminal]
----
AllNodesAtLatestRevision
3 nodes are at revision 12 <1>
----
<1> In this example, the latest revision number is `12`.
+
If the output shows a message similar to one of the following messages, the update is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.

** `3 nodes are at revision 11; 0 nodes have achieved new revision 12`
** `2 nodes are at revision 11; 1 nodes are at revision 12`

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="configuring-audit-policy-custom_{context}"]
= Configuring the audit log policy with custom rules

You can configure an audit log policy that defines custom rules. You can specify multiple groups and define which profile to use for that group.

These custom rules take precedence over the top-level profile field. The custom rules are evaluated from top to bottom, and the first that matches is applied.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Custom rules are ignored if the top-level profile field is set to `None`.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Edit the `APIServer` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit apiserver cluster
----

. Add the `spec.audit.customRules` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: APIServer
metadata:
...
spec:
  audit:
    customRules:                        <1>
    - group: system:authenticated:oauth
      profile: WriteRequestBodies
    - group: system:authenticated
      profile: AllRequestBodies
    profile: Default                    <2>
----
<1> Add one or more groups and specify the profile to use for that group. These custom rules take precedence over the top-level profile field. The custom rules are evaluated from top to bottom, and the first that matches is applied.
<2> Set to `Default`, `WriteRequestBodies`, or `AllRequestBodies`. If you do not set this top-level profile field, it defaults to the `Default` profile.
+
[WARNING]
====
Do not set the top-level profile field to `None` if you want to use custom rules. Custom rules are ignored if the top-level profile field is set to `None`.
====

. Save the file to apply the changes.

* Verify that a new revision of the Kubernetes API server pods is rolled out. It can take several minutes for all nodes to update to the new revision.
