[id="understanding-service-serving_{context}"]
= Understanding service serving certificates

Service serving certificates are intended to support complex
middleware applications that require encryption. These certificates are
issued as TLS web server certificates.

The `service-ca` controller uses the `x509.SHA256WithRSA` signature
algorithm to generate service certificates.

The generated certificate and key are in PEM format, stored in `tls.crt`
and `tls.key` respectively, within a created secret. The
certificate and key are automatically replaced when they get close to
expiration.

The service CA certificate, which issues the service certificates, is valid for 26 months and is automatically rotated when there is less than 13 months validity left. After rotation, the previous service CA configuration is still trusted until its expiration. This allows a grace period for all affected services to refresh their key material before the expiration. If you do not upgrade your cluster during this grace period, which restarts services and refreshes their key material, you might need to manually restart services to avoid failures after the previous service CA expires.

[NOTE]
====
You can use the following command to manually restart all pods in the cluster. Be aware that running this command causes a service interruption, because it deletes every running pod in every namespace. These pods will automatically restart after they are deleted.

[source,terminal]
----
$ for I in $(oc get ns -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]} {.metadata.name}{"\n"} {end}'); \
      do oc delete pods --all -n $I; \
      sleep 1; \
      done

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="add-service-certificate_{context}"]
= Add a service certificate

To secure communication to your service, generate a signed serving certificate and key pair into a secret in the same namespace as the service.

The generated certificate is only valid for the internal service DNS name `<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc`, and is only valid for internal communications. If your service is a headless service (no `clusterIP` value set), the generated certificate also contains a wildcard subject in the format of `*.<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the generated certificates contain wildcard subjects for headless services, you must not use the service CA if your client must differentiate between individual pods. In this case:

* Generate individual TLS certificates by using a different CA.
* Do not accept the service CA as a trusted CA for connections that are directed to individual pods and must not be impersonated by other pods. These connections must be configured to trust the CA that was used to generate the individual TLS certificates.
====

.Prerequisites:

* You must have a service defined.

.Procedure

. Annotate the service with `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate service <service_name> \//<1>
     service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name=<secret_name> //<2>
----
<1> Replace `<service_name>` with the name of the service to secure.
<2> `<secret_name>` will be the name of the generated secret containing the
certificate and key pair. For convenience, it is recommended that this
be the same as `<service_name>`.
+
For example, use the following command to annotate the service `test1`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate service test1 service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name=test1
----

. Examine the service to confirm that the annotations are present:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe service <service_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
...
Annotations:              service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name: <service_name>
                          service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-signed-by: openshift-service-serving-signer@1556850837
...
----

. After the cluster generates a secret for your service, your `Pod` spec can
mount it, and the pod will run after it becomes available.

[id="add-service-certificate-configmap_{context}"]
= Add the service CA bundle to a config map

A pod can access the service CA certificate by mounting a `ConfigMap` object that
is annotated with `service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true`.
Once annotated, the cluster automatically injects the service CA
certificate into the `service-ca.crt` key on the config map. Access to
this CA certificate allows TLS clients to verify connections to
services using service serving certificates.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After adding this annotation to a config map all existing data in it is
deleted. It is recommended to use a separate config map to contain the
`service-ca.crt`, instead of using the same config map that stores your
pod configuration.
====

.Procedure

. Annotate the config map with `service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate configmap <config_map_name> \//<1>
     service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true
----
<1> Replace `<config_map_name>` with the name of the config map to annotate.
+
[NOTE]
====
Explicitly referencing the `service-ca.crt` key in a volume mount will prevent a pod from starting until the config map has been injected with the CA bundle. This behavior can be overridden by setting the `optional` field to `true` for the volume's serving certificate configuration.
====
+
For example, use the following command to annotate the config map `test1`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate configmap test1 service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true
----

. View the config map to ensure that the service CA bundle has been injected:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmap <config_map_name> -o yaml

The service CA is valid for 26 months and is automatically refreshed when there is less than 13 months validity left.

If necessary, you can manually refresh the service CA by using the following procedure.

[WARNING]
====
A manually-rotated service CA does not maintain trust with the previous service CA. You might experience a temporary service disruption until the pods in the cluster are restarted, which ensures that pods are using service serving certificates issued by the new service CA.
====

which will be used to sign the new service certificates.
+
