[id="about-containers-images-and-image-streams"]
== Understanding containers, images, and image streams
Containers, images, and image streams are important concepts to understand when you set out to create and manage containerized software.
An image holds a set of software that is ready to run, while a container is a running instance of a container image.
An image stream provides a way of storing different versions of the same basic image.
Those different versions are represented by different tags on the same image name.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
// * openshift_images/images-understand.aodc

[id="images-about_{context}"]
= Images

Containers in {product-title} are based on OCI- or Docker-formatted container _images_. An image is a binary that includes all of the requirements for running a single container, as well as metadata describing its needs and capabilities.

You can think of it as a packaging technology. Containers only have access to resources defined in the image unless you give the container additional access when creating it. By deploying the same image in multiple containers across multiple hosts and load balancing between them, {product-title} can provide redundancy and horizontal scaling for a service packaged into an image.

You can use the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/managing_containers/#using_podman_to_work_with_containers[podman] or `docker` CLI directly to build images, but {product-title} also supplies builder images that assist with creating new images by adding your code or configuration to existing images.

Because applications develop over time, a single image name can actually refer to many different versions of the same image. Each different image is referred to uniquely by its hash, a long hexadecimal number such as `fd44297e2ddb050ec4f...`, which is usually shortened to 12 characters, such as `fd44297e2ddb`.

[id="images-image-registry-about_{context}"]
= Image registry

An image registry is a content server that can store and serve container images. For example:

[source,text]
----
registry.redhat.io
----

A registry contains a collection of one or more image repositories, which contain one or more tagged images. Red Hat provides a registry at `registry.redhat.io` for subscribers. {product-title} can also supply its own {product-registry} for managing custom container images.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
// * openshift_images/images-understand.aodc

[id="images-container-repository-about_{context}"]
= Image repository

An image repository is a collection of related container images and tags identifying them. For example, the {product-title} Jenkins images are in the repository:

[source,text]
----
docker.io/openshift/jenkins-2-centos7
----

// Module included in the following assemblies:
// * openshift_images/images-understand.adoc
// * openshift_images/tagging-images.adoc

[id="images-tag_{context}"]
= Image tags

An image tag is a label applied to a container image in a repository that distinguishes a specific image from other images in an image stream. Typically, the tag represents a version number of some sort. For example, here `:v3.11.59-2` is the tag:

[source,text]
----
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7:v3.11.59-2
----

You can add additional tags to an image. For example, an image might be assigned the tags `:v3.11.59-2` and `:latest`.

{product-title} provides the `oc tag` command, which is similar to the `docker tag` command, but operates on image streams instead of directly on images.

[id="images-id_{context}"]
= Image IDs

An image ID is a SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) code that can be used to pull an image. A SHA image ID cannot change. A specific SHA identifier always references the exact same container image content.  For example:

[source,text]
----
docker.io/openshift/jenkins-2-centos7@sha256:ab312bda324
----

[id="containers-about_{context}"]
= Containers

The basic units of {product-title} applications are called containers. link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers#overview[Linux container technologies] are lightweight mechanisms for isolating running processes so that they are limited to interacting with only their designated resources. The word container is defined as a specific running or paused instance of a container image.

Many application instances can be running in containers on a single host without visibility into each others' processes, files, network, and so on. Typically, each container provides a single service, often called a micro-service, such as a web server or a database, though containers can be used for arbitrary workloads.

The Linux kernel has been incorporating capabilities for container technologies for years. The Docker project developed a convenient management interface for Linux containers on a host. More recently, the link:https://github.com/opencontainers/[Open Container Initiative] has developed open standards for container formats and container runtimes. {product-title} and Kubernetes add the ability to orchestrate OCI- and Docker-formatted containers across multi-host installations.

Though you do not directly interact with container runtimes when using {product-title}, understanding their capabilities and terminology is important for understanding their role in {product-title} and how your applications function inside of containers.

Tools such as link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/managing_containers/#using_podman_to_work_with_containers[podman] can be used to replace `docker` command-line tools for running and managing containers directly. Using `podman`, you can experiment with containers separately from {product-title}.

[id="images-imagestream-use_{context}"]
= Why use imagestreams

An image stream and its associated tags provide an abstraction for referencing container images from within {product-title}. The image stream and its tags allow you to see what images are available and ensure that you are using the specific image you need even if the image in the repository changes.

Image streams do not contain actual image data, but present a single virtual view of related images, similar to an image repository.

You can configure builds and deployments to watch an image stream for notifications when new images are added and react by performing a build or deployment, respectively.

For example, if a deployment is using a certain image and a new version of that image is created, a deployment could be automatically performed to pick up the new version of the image.

However, if the image stream tag used by the deployment or build is not updated, then even if the container image in the container image registry is updated, the build or deployment continues using the previous, presumably known good
image.

The source images can be stored in any of the following:

* {product-title}'s integrated registry.
* An external registry, for example registry.redhat.io or quay.io.
* Other image streams in the {product-title} cluster.

When you define an object that references an image stream tag, such as a build or deployment configuration, you point to an image stream tag and not the repository. When you build or deploy your application, {product-title} queries the repository using the image stream tag to locate the associated ID of the image and uses that exact image.

The image stream metadata is stored in the etcd instance along with other cluster information.

Using image streams has several significant benefits:

* You can tag, rollback a tag, and quickly deal with images, without having to re-push using the command line.

* You can trigger builds and deployments when a new image is pushed to the registry. Also, {product-title} has generic triggers for other resources, such as Kubernetes objects.

* You can mark a tag for periodic re-import. If the source image has changed, that change is picked up and reflected in the image stream, which triggers the build or deployment flow, depending upon the build or deployment configuration.

* You can share images using fine-grained access control and quickly distribute images across your teams.

* If the source image changes, the image stream tag still points to a known-good version of the image, ensuring that your application do not break unexpectedly.

* You can configure security around who can view and use the images through permissions on the image stream objects.

* Users that lack permission to read or list images on the cluster level can still retrieve the images tagged in a project using image streams.

[id="images-imagestream-image_{context}"]
= Image stream images

An image stream image allows you to retrieve a specific container image from a particular image stream where it is tagged. An image stream image is an API resource object that pulls together some metadata about a particular image SHA identifier.

// Module included in the following assemblies:

[id="images-imagestream-trigger_{context}"]
= Image stream triggers

An image stream trigger causes a specific action when an image stream tag changes. For example, importing can cause the value of the tag to change, which causes a trigger to fire when there are deployments, builds, or other resources listening for those.
