toc::[]

The following sections provide an overview and instructions for using image tags in the context of container images for working with {product-title} image streams and their tags.

[id="images-tag_{context}"]
= Image tags

An image tag is a label applied to a container image in a repository that distinguishes a specific image from other images in an image stream. Typically, the tag represents a version number of some sort. For example, here `:v3.11.59-2` is the tag:

[source,text]
----
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7:v3.11.59-2
----

You can add additional tags to an image. For example, an image might be assigned the tags `:v3.11.59-2` and `:latest`.

{product-title} provides the `oc tag` command, which is similar to the `docker tag` command, but operates on image streams instead of directly on images.

[id="images-tagging-conventions_{context}"]
= Image tag conventions

Images evolve over time and their tags reflect this. Generally, an image tag always points to the latest image built.

If there is too much information embedded in a tag name, like `v2.0.1-may-2019`, the tag points to just one revision of an image and is never updated. Using default image pruning options, such an image is never removed.

If the tag is named `v2.0`, image revisions are more likely. This results in longer tag history and, therefore, the image pruner is more likely to remove old and unused images.

Although tag naming convention is up to you, here are a few examples in the format `<image_name>:<image_tag>`:

.Image tag naming conventions
[width="50%",options="header"]
|===
|Description |Example

|Revision
|`myimage:v2.0.1`

|Architecture
|`myimage:v2.0-x86_64`

|Base image
|`myimage:v1.2-centos7`

|Latest (potentially unstable)
|`myimage:latest`

|Latest stable
|`myimage:stable`
|===

If you require dates in tag names, periodically inspect old and unsupported images and `istags` and remove them. Otherwise, you can experience increasing resource usage caused by retaining old images.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="images-add-tags-to-imagestreams_{context}"]
= Adding tags to image streams

An image stream in {product-title} comprises zero or more container images identified by tags.

There are different types of tags available. The default behavior uses a `permanent` tag, which points to a specific image in time. If the `permanent` tag is in use and the source changes, the tag does not change for the destination.

A `tracking` tag means the destination tag's metadata is updated during the import of the source tag.

.Procedure

* You can add tags to an image stream using the `oc tag` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc tag <source> <destination>
----
+
For example, to configure the `ruby` image stream `static-2.0` tag to always refer to the current image for the `ruby` image stream `2.0` tag:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc tag ruby:2.0 ruby:static-2.0
----
+
This creates a new image stream tag named `static-2.0` in the `ruby` image stream. The new tag directly references the image id that the `ruby:2.0` image stream tag pointed to at the time `oc tag` was run, and the image it points to never changes.

* To ensure the destination tag is updated when the source tag changes, use the `--alias=true` flag:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc tag --alias=true <source> <destination>
----

[NOTE]
====
Use a tracking tag for creating permanent aliases, for example, `latest` or `stable`. The tag only works correctly within a single image stream. Trying to create a cross-image stream alias produces an error.
====

* You can also add the `--scheduled=true` flag to have the destination tag be
refreshed, or re-imported, periodically. The period is configured globally at
the system level.

* The `--reference` flag creates an image stream tag that is not imported. The tag points to the source location, permanently.
+
If you want to instruct {product-title} to always fetch the tagged image from the integrated registry, use `--reference-policy=local`. The registry uses the pull-through feature to serve the image to the client. By default, the image blobs are mirrored locally by the registry. As a result, they can be pulled more quickly the next time they are needed. The flag also allows for pulling from insecure registries without a need to supply `--insecure-registry` to the container runtime as long as the image stream has an insecure annotation or the tag has an insecure import policy.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="images-remove-tag-imagestream_{context}"]
= Removing tags from image streams

You can remove tags from an image stream.

.Procedure

* To remove a tag completely from an image stream run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete istag/ruby:latest
----
+
or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc tag -d ruby:latest
----

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="images-referencing-images-imagestreams_{context}"]
= Referencing images in imagestreams

You can use tags to reference images in image streams using the following reference types.

.Imagestream reference types
[width="50%",options="header"]
|===
|Reference type |Description

|`ImageStreamTag`
|An `ImageStreamTag` is used to reference or retrieve an image for a given image stream and tag.

|`ImageStreamImage`
|An `ImageStreamImage` is used to reference or retrieve an image for a given image stream and image `sha` ID.

|`DockerImage`
|A `DockerImage` is used to reference or retrieve an image for a given external registry. It uses standard Docker `pull specification` for its name.
|===

When viewing example image stream definitions you may notice they contain definitions of `ImageStreamTag` and references to `DockerImage`, but nothing related to `ImageStreamImage`.

This is because the `ImageStreamImage` objects are automatically created in {product-title} when you import or tag an image into the image stream. You should never have to explicitly define an `ImageStreamImage` object in any image stream definition that you use to create image streams.

.Procedure

* To reference an image for a given image stream and tag, use `ImageStreamTag`:
+
----
<image_stream_name>:<tag>
----

* To reference an image for a given image stream and image `sha` ID, use `ImageStreamImage`:
+
----
<image_stream_name>@<id>
----
+
The `<id>` is an immutable identifier for a specific image, also called a
digest.

* To reference or retrieve an image for a given external registry, use `DockerImage`:
+
----
openshift/ruby-20-centos7:2.0
----
+
[NOTE]
====
When no tag is specified, it is assumed the `latest` tag is used.
====
+
You can also reference a third-party registry:
+
----
registry.redhat.io/rhel7:latest
----
+
Or an image with a digest:
+
----
centos/ruby-22-centos7@sha256:3a335d7d8a452970c5b4054ad7118ff134b3a6b50a2bb6d0c07c746e8986b28e
