toc::[]

The Cluster Samples Operator, which operates in the `openshift` namespace, installs and updates the {op-system-base-full}-based {product-title} image streams and {product-title} templates.

[IMPORTANT]
.Cluster Samples Operator is being downsized
====
* Starting from {product-title} 4.13, Cluster Samples Operator is downsized. Cluster Samples Operator will stop providing the following updates for non-Source-to-Image (Non-S2I) image streams and templates:
- new image streams and templates
- updates to the existing image streams and templates unless it is a CVE update

* Cluster Samples Operator will provide support for Non-S2I image streams and templates as per the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#dates[{product-title} lifecycle policy dates and support guidelines].

* Cluster Samples Operator will continue to support the S2I builder image streams and templates and accept the updates. S2I image streams and templates include:
- Ruby
- Python
- Node.js
- Perl
- PHP
- HTTPD
- Nginx
- EAP
- Java
- Webserver
- .NET
- Go

* Starting from {product-title} 4.16, Cluster Samples Operator will stop managing non-S2I image streams and templates. You can contact the image stream or template owner for any requirements and future plans. In addition, refer to the link:https://github.com/openshift/library/blob/master/official.yaml[list of the repositories hosting the image stream or templates].

[id="samples-operator-overview_{context}"]
= Understanding the Cluster Samples Operator

During installation, the Operator creates the default configuration object for
itself and then creates the sample image streams and templates, including quick start templates.

[NOTE]
====
To facilitate image stream imports from other registries that require credentials, a cluster administrator can create any additional secrets that contain the content of a Docker `config.json` file in the `openshift` namespace needed for image import.
====

The Cluster Samples Operator configuration is a cluster-wide resource, and the deployment is contained within the `openshift-cluster-samples-operator` namespace.

The image for the Cluster Samples Operator contains image stream and template definitions
for the associated {product-title} release. When each sample is created or updated,
the Cluster Samples Operator includes an annotation that denotes the version of
{product-title}. The Operator uses this annotation to ensure that each sample
matches the release version. Samples outside of its inventory are ignored, as
are skipped samples. Modifications to any samples that are managed by the
Operator, where that version annotation is modified or deleted, are reverted
automatically.

[NOTE]
====
The Jenkins images are part of the image payload from
installation and are tagged into the image streams directly.
====

The Cluster Samples Operator configuration resource includes a finalizer which cleans up
the following upon deletion:

* Operator managed image streams.
* Operator managed templates.
* Operator generated configuration resources.
* Cluster status resources.

Upon deletion of the samples resource, the Cluster Samples Operator recreates the
resource using the default configuration.

[id="samples-operator-bootstrapped"]
== Cluster Samples Operator's use of management state

The Cluster Samples Operator is bootstrapped as `Managed` by default or if global proxy is configured. In the `Managed` state, the Cluster Samples Operator is actively managing its resources and keeping the component active in order to pull sample image streams and images from the registry and ensure that the requisite sample templates are installed.

Certain circumstances result in the Cluster Samples Operator bootstrapping itself as `Removed` including:

* If the Cluster Samples Operator cannot reach link:https://registry.redhat.io[registry.redhat.io] after three minutes on initial startup after a clean installation.
* If the Cluster Samples Operator detects it is on an IPv6 network.
// cannot configure the Samples Operator
* If the xref:../openshift_images/image-configuration.adoc#images-configuration-parameters_image-configuration[image controller configuration parameters] prevent the creation of image streams by using the default image registry, or by using the image registry specified by the xref:../openshift_images/configuring-samples-operator.adoc#samples-operator-configuration_configuring-samples-operator[`samplesRegistry` setting].

[NOTE]
====
For {product-title}, the default image registry is
====

However, if the Cluster Samples Operator detects that it is on an IPv6 network and an {product-title} global proxy is configured, then IPv6 check supersedes all the checks. As a result, the Cluster Samples Operator bootstraps itself as `Removed`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
IPv6 installations are not currently supported by link:https://registry.redhat.io[registry.redhat.io]. The Cluster Samples Operator pulls most of the sample image streams and images from link:https://registry.redhat.io[registry.redhat.io].
====

// Restricted network not supported ROSA/OSD
[id="samples-operator-restricted-network-install"]
=== Restricted network installation

Boostrapping as `Removed` when unable to access `registry.redhat.io` facilitates restricted network installations when the network restriction is already in place. Bootstrapping as `Removed` when network access is restricted allows the cluster administrator more time to decide if samples are desired, because the Cluster Samples Operator does not submit alerts that sample image stream imports are failing when the management state is set to `Removed`. When the Cluster Samples Operator comes up as `Managed` and attempts to install sample image streams, it starts alerting two hours after initial installation if there are failing imports.

[id="samples-operator-restricted-network-install-with-access"]
=== Restricted network installation with initial network access

Conversely, if a cluster that is intended to be a restricted network or disconnected cluster is first installed while network access exists, the Cluster Samples Operator installs the content from `registry.redhat.io` since it can access it. If you want the Cluster Samples Operator to still bootstrap as `Removed` in order to defer samples installation until you have decided which samples are desired, set up image mirrors, and so on, then follow the instructions for using the Samples Operator with an alternate registry and customizing nodes, both linked in the additional resources section, to override the Cluster Samples Operator default configuration and initially come up as `Removed`.

You must put the following additional YAML file in the `openshift` directory created by `openshift-install create manifest`:

.Example Cluster Samples Operator YAML file with `managementState: Removed`
[source,yaml]

[id="samples-operator-retries"]
== Cluster Samples Operator's tracking and error recovery of image stream imports

After creation or update of a samples image stream, the Cluster Samples Operator monitors the progress of each image stream tag's image import.

If an import fails, the Cluster Samples Operator retries the import through the image stream image import API, which is the same API used by the `oc import-image` command, approximately every 15 minutes until it sees the import succeed, or if
the Cluster Samples Operator's configuration is changed such that either the image stream is added to the `skippedImagestreams` list, or the management state is changed to `Removed`.

// Restricted network not supported ROSA/OSD
* To ensure the Cluster Samples Operator bootstraps as `Removed` in a restricted network installation with initial network access to defer samples installation until you have decided which samples are desired, follow the instructions for xref:../installing/install_config/installing-customizing.adoc#installing-customizing[customizing nodes] to override the Cluster Samples Operator default configuration and initially come up as `Removed`.
** To host samples in your disconnected environment, follow the instructions for xref:../openshift_images/samples-operator-alt-registry.adoc#samples-operator-alt-registry[using the Cluster Samples Operator with an alternate registry].

[id="installation-images-samples-disconnected-mirroring-assist_{context}"]
= Cluster Samples Operator assistance for mirroring

During installation, {product-title} creates a config map named `imagestreamtag-to-image` in the `openshift-cluster-samples-operator` namespace. The `imagestreamtag-to-image` config map contains an entry, the populating image, for each image stream tag.

The format of the key for each entry in the data field in the config map is `<image_stream_name>_<image_stream_tag_name>`.

During a disconnected installation of {product-title}, the status of the Cluster Samples Operator is set to `Removed`. If you choose to change it to `Managed`, it installs samples.
[NOTE]
====
The use of samples in a network-restricted or discontinued environment may require access to services external to your network. Some example services include: Github, Maven Central, npm, RubyGems, PyPi and others. There might be additional steps to take that allow the cluster samples operators's objects to reach the services they require.
====

You can use this config map as a reference for which images need to be mirrored for your image streams to import.

* While the Cluster Samples Operator is set to `Removed`, you can create your mirrored registry, or determine which existing mirrored registry you want to use.
* Mirror the samples you want to the mirrored registry using the new config map as your guide.
* Add any of the image streams you did not mirror to the `skippedImagestreams` list of the Cluster Samples Operator configuration object.
* Set `samplesRegistry` of the Cluster Samples Operator configuration object to the mirrored registry.
* Then set the Cluster Samples Operator to `Managed` to install the image streams you have mirrored.

[id="samples-operator-configuration_{context}"]
= Cluster Samples Operator configuration parameters

The samples resource offers the following configuration fields:

[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`managementState`
|`Managed`: The Cluster Samples Operator updates the samples as the configuration dictates.

`Unmanaged`: The Cluster Samples Operator ignores updates to its configuration resource object and any image streams or templates in the `openshift` namespace.

`Removed`: The Cluster Samples Operator removes the set of `Managed` image streams and templates in the `openshift` namespace. It ignores new samples created by the cluster administrator or any samples in the skipped lists. After the removals are complete, the Cluster Samples Operator works like it is in the `Unmanaged` state and ignores any watch events on the sample resources, image streams, or templates.

|`samplesRegistry`
|Allows you to specify which registry is accessed by image streams for their image content. `samplesRegistry` defaults to `registry.redhat.io` for {product-title}.

[NOTE]
====
Creation or update of RHEL content does not commence if the secret for pull access is not in place when either `Samples Registry` is not explicitly set, leaving an empty string, or when it is set to registry.redhat.io. In both cases, image imports work off of registry.redhat.io, which requires credentials.

Creation or update of RHEL content is not gated by the existence of the pull secret if the `Samples Registry` is overridden to a value other than the empty string or registry.redhat.io.
====

|`architectures`
|Placeholder to choose an architecture type.

|`skippedImagestreams`
|Image streams that are in the Cluster Samples Operator's inventory but that the cluster administrator wants the Operator to ignore or not manage. You can add a list of image stream names to this parameter. For example, `["httpd","perl"]`.

|`skippedTemplates`
|Templates that are in the Cluster Samples Operator's inventory, but that the cluster administrator wants the Operator to ignore or not manage.

|===

Secret, image stream, and template watch events can come in before the initial samples resource object is created, the Cluster Samples Operator detects and re-queues the event.

== Configuration restrictions

When the Cluster Samples Operator starts supporting multiple architectures, the architecture list is not allowed to be changed while in the `Managed` state.

To change the architectures values, a cluster administrator must:

* Mark the `Management State` as `Removed`, saving the change.
* In a subsequent change, edit the architecture and change the `Management State` back to `Managed`.

The Cluster Samples Operator still processes secrets while in `Removed` state. You can create the secret before switching to `Removed`, while in `Removed` before switching to `Managed`, or after switching to `Managed` state. There are delays in creating the samples until the secret event is processed if you create the secret after switching to `Managed`. This helps facilitate the changing of the registry, where you choose to remove all the samples before switching to insure a clean slate. Removing all samples before switching is not required.

== Conditions

The samples resource maintains the following conditions in its status:

[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Condition |Description

|`SamplesExists`
|Indicates the samples are created in the `openshift` namespace.

|`ImageChangesInProgress`
|`True` when image streams are created or updated, but not all of the tag spec generations and tag status generations match.

`False` when all of the generations match, or unrecoverable errors occurred during import, the last seen error is in the message field. The list of pending image streams is in the reason field.

This condition is deprecated in {product-title}.

|`ConfigurationValid`
|`True` or `False` based on whether any of the restricted changes noted previously are submitted.

|`RemovePending`
|Indicator that there is a `Management State: Removed` setting pending, but the Cluster Samples Operator is waiting for the deletions to complete.

|`ImportImageErrorsExist`
|Indicator of which image streams had errors during the image import phase for one of their tags.

`True` when an error has occurred. The list of image streams with an error is in the reason field. The details of each error reported are in the message field.

|`MigrationInProgress`
|`True` when the Cluster Samples Operator detects that the version is different than the Cluster Samples Operator version with which the current samples set are installed.

This condition is deprecated in {product-title}.
