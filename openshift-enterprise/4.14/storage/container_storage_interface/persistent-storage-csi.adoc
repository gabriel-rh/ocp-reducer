toc::[]

The Container Storage Interface (CSI) allows {product-title} to consume
storage from storage back ends that implement the
link:https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec[CSI interface]
as persistent storage.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} {product-version} supports version 1.6.0 of the link:https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec[CSI specification].

[id="persistent-storage-csi-architecture_{context}"]
= CSI architecture

CSI drivers are typically shipped as container images. These containers
are not aware of {product-title} where they run. To use CSI-compatible
storage back end in {product-title}, the cluster administrator must deploy
several components that serve as a bridge between {product-title} and the
storage driver.

The following diagram provides a high-level overview about the components
running in pods in the {product-title} cluster.

image::csi-arch-rev1.png["Architecture of CSI components"]

It is possible to run multiple CSI drivers for different storage back ends.
Each driver needs its own external controllers deployment and daemon set
with the driver and CSI registrar.

[id="external-csi-contollers_{context}"]
= External CSI controllers

External CSI controllers is a deployment that deploys one or more pods
with five containers:

* The snapshotter container watches `VolumeSnapshot` and `VolumeSnapshotContent` objects and is responsible for the creation and deletion of `VolumeSnapshotContent` object.
* The resizer container is a sidecar container that watches for `PersistentVolumeClaim` updates and triggers `ControllerExpandVolume` operations against a CSI endpoint if you request more storage on `PersistentVolumeClaim` object.
* An external CSI attacher container translates `attach` and `detach`
calls from {product-title} to respective `ControllerPublish` and
`ControllerUnpublish` calls to the CSI driver.
* An external CSI provisioner container that translates `provision` and
`delete` calls from {product-title} to respective `CreateVolume` and
`DeleteVolume` calls to the CSI driver.
* A CSI driver container.

The CSI attacher and CSI provisioner containers communicate with the CSI
driver container using UNIX Domain Sockets, ensuring that no CSI
communication leaves the pod. The CSI driver is not accessible from
outside of the pod.

[NOTE]
====
The `attach`, `detach`, `provision`, and `delete` operations typically require
the CSI driver to use credentials to the storage backend. Run the CSI
controller pods on infrastructure nodes so the credentials are never leaked
to user processes, even in the event of a catastrophic security breach
on a compute node.
====

[NOTE]
====
The external attacher must also run for CSI drivers that do not support
third-party `attach` or `detach` operations. The external attacher will
not issue any `ControllerPublish` or `ControllerUnpublish` operations to
the CSI driver. However, it still must run to implement the necessary
{product-title} attachment API.

[id="csi-driver-daemonset_{context}"]
= CSI driver daemon set

The CSI driver daemon set runs a pod on every node that allows
{product-title} to mount storage provided by the CSI driver to the node
and use it in user workloads (pods) as persistent volumes (PVs). The pod
with the CSI driver installed contains the following containers:

* A CSI driver registrar, which registers the CSI driver into the
`openshift-node` service running on the node. The `openshift-node` process
running on the node then directly connects with the CSI driver using the
UNIX Domain Socket available on the node.
* A CSI driver.

The CSI driver deployed on the node should have as few credentials to the
storage back end as possible. {product-title} will only use the node plugin
set of CSI calls such as `NodePublish`/`NodeUnpublish` and
`NodeStage`/`NodeUnstage`, if these calls are implemented.

[id="csi-drivers-supported_{context}"]
= CSI drivers supported by {product-title}

{product-title} installs certain CSI drivers by default, giving users storage options that are not possible with in-tree volume plugins.

To create CSI-provisioned persistent volumes that mount to these supported storage assets, {product-title} installs the necessary CSI driver Operator, the CSI driver, and the required storage class by default. For more details about the default namespace of the Operator and driver, see the documentation for the specific CSI Driver Operator.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The AWS EFS and GCP Filestore CSI drivers are not installed by default, and must be installed manually. For instructions on installing the AWS EFS CSI driver, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_dedicated/4/html/storage/using-container-storage-interface-csi#osd-persistent-storage-aws-efs-csi[Setting up AWS Elastic File Service CSI Driver Operator].

= Dynamic provisioning

Dynamic provisioning of persistent storage depends on the capabilities of
the CSI driver and underlying storage back end. The provider of the CSI
driver should document how to create a storage class in {product-title} and
the parameters available for configuration.

The created storage class can be configured to enable dynamic provisioning.

.Procedure

* Create a default storage class that ensures all PVCs that do not require
any special storage class are provisioned by the installed CSI driver.
