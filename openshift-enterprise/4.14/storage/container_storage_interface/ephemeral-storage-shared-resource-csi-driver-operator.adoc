[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, you can use the Shared Resource CSI Driver in {product-title} to provision inline ephemeral volumes that contain the contents of `Secret` or `ConfigMap` objects. This way, pods and other Kubernetes types that expose volume mounts, and {product-title} Builds can securely use the contents of those objects across potentially any namespace in the cluster. To accomplish this, there are currently two types of shared resources: a `SharedSecret` custom resource for `Secret` objects, and a `SharedConfigMap` custom resource for `ConfigMap` objects.

[id="csi-about_{context}"]
= About CSI
Storage vendors have traditionally provided storage drivers as part of Kubernetes. With the implementation of the Container Storage Interface (CSI), third-party providers can instead deliver storage plugins using a standard interface without ever having to change the core Kubernetes code.

CSI Operators give {product-title} users storage options, such as volume snapshots, that are not possible with in-tree volume plugins.

= Sharing secrets across namespaces

[role="_abstract"]
To share a secret across namespaces in a cluster, you create a `SharedSecret` custom resource (CR) instance for the `Secret` object that you want to share.

.Prerequisites

You must have permission to perform the following actions:

* Create instances of the `sharedsecrets.sharedresource.openshift.io` custom resource definition (CRD) at a cluster-scoped level.
* Manage roles and role bindings across the namespaces in the cluster to control which users can get, list, and watch those instances.
* Manage roles and role bindings to control whether the service account specified by a pod can mount a Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume that references the `SharedSecret` CR instance you want to use.
* Access the namespaces that contain the Secrets you want to share.

.Procedure

* Create a `SharedSecret` CR instance for the `Secret` object you want to share across namespaces in the cluster:

= Using a SharedSecret instance in a pod

[role="_abstract"]
To access a `SharedSecret` custom resource (CR) instance from a pod, you grant a given service account RBAC permissions to use that `SharedSecret` CR instance.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a `SharedSecret` CR instance for the secret you want to share across namespaces in the cluster.
* You must have permission to perform the following actions
** Discover which `SharedSecret` CR instances are available by entering the `oc get sharedsecrets` command and getting a non-empty list back.
** Determine if the service account your pod specifies is allowed to use the given `SharedSecret` CR instance. That is, you can run `oc adm policy who-can use <identifier of specific SharedSecret>` to see if the service account in your namespace is listed.
** Determine if the service account your pod specifies is allowed to use `csi` volumes, or if you, as the requesting user who created the pod directly, are allowed to use `csi` volumes.  See "Understanding and managing pod security admission" for details.

[NOTE]
====
If neither of the last two prerequisites in this list are met, create, or ask someone to create, the necessary role-based access control (RBAC) so that you can discover `SharedSecret` CR instances and enable service accounts to use `SharedSecret` CR instances.
====

.Procedure

. Grant a given service account RBAC permissions to use the `SharedSecret` CR instance in its pod by using `oc apply` with YAML content:
+
[NOTE]
====
Currently, `kubectl` and `oc` have hard-coded special case logic restricting the `use` verb to roles centered around pod security. Therefore, you cannot use `oc create role ...` to create the role needed for consuming `SharedSecret` CR instances.

[id="ephemeral-storage-additional-support-limitations-for-shared-resource-csi-driver_{context}"]
= Additional support limitations for the Shared Resource CSI Driver

[role="_abstract"]
The Shared Resource CSI Driver has the following noteworthy limitations:

* The driver is subject to the limitations of Container Storage Interface (CSI) inline ephemeral volumes.
* The value of the `readOnly` field must be `true`. On `Pod` creation, a validating admission webhook rejects the pod creation if `readOnly` is `false`. If for some reason the validating admission webhook cannot be contacted, on volume provisioning during pod startup, the driver returns an error to the kubelet. Requiring `readOnly` is `true` is in keeping with proposed best practices for the upstream Kubernetes CSI Driver to apply SELinux labels to associated volumes.
* The driver ignores the `FSType` field because it only supports `tmpfs` volumes.
* The driver ignores the `NodePublishSecretRef` field. Instead, it uses `SubjectAccessReviews` with the `use` verb to evaluate whether a pod can obtain a volume that contains `SharedSecret` or `SharedConfigMap` custom resource (CR) instances.
* You cannot create `SharedSecret` or `SharedConfigMap` custom resource (CR) instances whose names start with `openshift`.

:leveloffset!:

:leveloffset: +1

:_mod-docs-content-type: REFERENCE

[id="ephemeral-storage-additional-details-about-volumeattributes-on-shared-resource-pod-volumes_{context}"]
= Additional details about VolumeAttributes on shared resource pod volumes

[role="_abstract"]
The following attributes affect shared resource pod volumes in various ways:

* The `refreshResource` attribute in the `volumeAttributes` properties.
* The `refreshResources` attribute in the Shared Resource CSI Driver configuration.
* The `sharedSecret` and `sharedConfigMap` attributes in the `volumeAttributes` properties.

== The `refreshResource` attribute

The Shared Resource CSI Driver honors the `refreshResource` attribute in `volumeAttributes` properties of the volume. This attribute controls whether updates to the contents of the underlying `Secret` or `ConfigMap` object are copied to the volume *after* the volume is initially provisioned as part of pod startup. The default value of `refreshResource` is `true`, which means that the contents are updated.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the Shared Resource CSI Driver configuration has disabled the refreshing of both the shared `SharedSecret` and `SharedConfigMap` custom resource (CR) instances, then the `refreshResource` attribute in the `volumeAttribute` properties has no effect. The intent of this attribute is to disable refresh for specific volume mounts when refresh is generally allowed.
====

== The `refreshResources` attribute

You can use a global switch to enable or disable refreshing of shared resources. This switch is the `refreshResources` attribute in the `csi-driver-shared-resource-config` config map for the Shared Resource CSI Driver, which you can find in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace. If you set this `refreshResources` attribute to `false`, none of the `Secret` or `ConfigMap` object-related content stored in the volume is updated after the initial provisioning of the volume.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using this Shared Resource CSI Driver configuration to disable refreshing affects all the cluster's volume mounts that use the Shared Resource CSI Driver, regardless of the `refreshResource` attribute in the `volumeAttributes` properties of any of those volumes.
====

== Validation of volumeAttributes before provisioning a shared resource volume for a pod

In the `volumeAttributes` of a single volume, you must set either a `sharedSecret` or a `sharedConfigMap` attribute to the value of a `SharedSecret` or a `SharedConfigMap` CS instance. Otherwise, when the volume is provisioned during pod startup, a validation checks the `volumeAttributes` of that volume and returns an error to the kubelet under the following conditions:

* Both `sharedSecret` and `sharedConfigMap` attributes have specified values.
* Neither `sharedSecret` nor `sharedConfigMap` attributes have specified values.
* The value of the `sharedSecret` or `sharedConfigMap` attribute does not correspond to the name of a `SharedSecret` or `SharedConfigMap` CR instance on the cluster.

= Integration between shared resources, Insights Operator, and {product-title} Builds

[role="_abstract"]
Integration between shared resources, Insights Operator, and {product-title} Builds makes using Red Hat subscriptions (RHEL entitlements) easier in {product-title} Builds.

Previously, in {product-title} 4.9.x and earlier, you manually imported your credentials and copied them to each project or namespace where you were running builds.

Now, in {product-title} 4.10 and later, {product-title} Builds can use Red Hat subscriptions (RHEL entitlements) by referencing shared resources and the simple content access feature provided by Insights Operator:

* The simple content access feature imports your subscription credentials to a well-known `Secret` object. See the links in the following "Additional resources" section.
* The cluster administrator creates a `SharedSecret` custom resource (CR) instance around that `Secret` object and grants permission to particular projects or namespaces. In particular, the cluster administrator gives the `builder` service account permission to use that `SharedSecret` CR instance.
* Builds that run within those projects or namespaces can mount a CSI Volume that references the `SharedSecret` CR instance and its entitled RHEL content.
