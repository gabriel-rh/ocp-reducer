toc::[]

_Deployment strategies_ are used to change or upgrade applications without downtime so that users barely notice a change.

Because users generally access applications through a route handled by a router, deployment strategies can focus on `DeploymentConfig` object features or routing features. Strategies that focus on `DeploymentConfig` object features impact all routes that use the application. Strategies that use router features target individual routes.

Most deployment strategies are supported through the `DeploymentConfig` object, and some additional strategies are supported through router features.

[id="choosing-deployment-strategies"]
== Choosing a deployment strategy

Consider the following when choosing a deployment strategy:

- Long-running connections must be handled gracefully.
- Database conversions can be complex and must be done and rolled back along with the application.
- If the application is a hybrid of microservices and traditional components, downtime might be required to complete the transition.
- You must have the infrastructure to do this.
- If you have a non-isolated test environment, you can break both new and old versions.

A deployment strategy uses readiness checks to determine if a new pod is ready for use. If a readiness check fails, the `DeploymentConfig` object retries to run the pod until it times out. The default timeout is `10m`, a value set in `TimeoutSeconds` in `dc.spec.strategy.*params`.

// Rolling strategies
:leveloffset: +1

// Module included in the following assemblies:

// * applications/deployments/deployment-strategies.adoc

[id="deployments-rolling-strategy_{context}"]
= Rolling strategy

A rolling deployment slowly replaces instances of the previous version of an application with instances of the new version of the application. The rolling strategy is the default deployment strategy used if no strategy is specified on a `DeploymentConfig` object.

A rolling deployment typically waits for new pods to become `ready` via a readiness check before scaling down the old components. If a significant issue occurs, the rolling deployment can be aborted.

*When to use a rolling deployment:*

- When you want to take no downtime during an application update.
- When your application supports having old code and new code running at the same time.

A rolling deployment means you have both old and new versions of your code running at the same time. This typically requires that your application handle N-1 compatibility.

.Example rolling strategy definition
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Rolling
  rollingParams:
    updatePeriodSeconds: 1 <1>
    intervalSeconds: 1 <2>
    timeoutSeconds: 120 <3>
    maxSurge: "20%" <4>
    maxUnavailable: "10%" <5>
    pre: {} <6>
    post: {}
----
<1> The time to wait between individual pod updates. If unspecified, this value defaults to `1`.
<2> The time to wait between polling the deployment status after update. If unspecified, this value defaults to `1`.
<3> The time to wait for a scaling event before giving up. Optional; the default is `600`. Here, _giving up_ means automatically rolling back to the previous complete deployment.
<4> `maxSurge` is optional and defaults to `25%` if not specified. See the information below the following procedure.
<5> `maxUnavailable` is optional and defaults to `25%` if not specified. See the information below the following procedure.
<6> `pre` and `post` are both lifecycle hooks.

The rolling strategy:

. Executes any `pre` lifecycle hook.
. Scales up the new replication controller based on the surge count.
. Scales down the old replication controller based on the max unavailable count.
. Repeats this scaling until the new replication controller has reached the desired replica count and the old replication controller has been scaled to zero.
. Executes any `post` lifecycle hook.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When scaling down, the rolling strategy waits for pods to become ready so it can decide whether further scaling would affect availability. If scaled up pods never become ready, the deployment process will eventually time out and result in a deployment failure.
====

The `maxUnavailable` parameter is the maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update. The `maxSurge` parameter is the maximum number of pods that can be scheduled above the original number of pods. Both parameters can be set to either a percentage (e.g., `10%`) or an absolute value (e.g., `2`). The default value for both is `25%`.

These parameters allow the deployment to be tuned for availability and speed. For example:

- `maxUnavailable*=0` and `maxSurge*=20%` ensures full capacity is maintained during the update and rapid scale up.
- `maxUnavailable*=10%` and `maxSurge*=0` performs an update using no extra capacity (an in-place update).
- `maxUnavailable*=10%` and `maxSurge*=10%` scales up and down quickly with some potential for capacity loss.

Generally, if you want fast rollouts, use `maxSurge`. If you have to take into account resource quota and can accept partial unavailability, use
`maxUnavailable`.

// Module included in the following assemblies:

// * applications/deployments/deployment-strategies.adoc

[id="deployments-canary-deployments_{context}"]
= Canary deployments

All rolling deployments in {product-title} are _canary deployments_; a new version (the canary) is tested before all of the old instances are replaced. If the readiness check never succeeds, the canary instance is removed and the `DeploymentConfig` object will be automatically rolled back.

The readiness check is part of the application code and can be as sophisticated as necessary to ensure the new instance is ready to be used. If you must implement more complex checks of the application (such as sending real user workloads to the new instance), consider implementing a custom deployment or using a blue-green deployment strategy.

[id="deployments-creating-rolling-deployment_{context}"]
= Creating a rolling deployment

Rolling deployments are the default type in {product-title}. You can create a rolling deployment using the CLI.

.Procedure

. Create an application based on the example deployment images found in link:https://quay.io/repository/openshifttest/deployment-example[Quay.io]:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app quay.io/openshifttest/deployment-example:latest
----

. If you have the router installed, make the application available via a route or use the service IP directly.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc expose svc/deployment-example
----

. Browse to the application at `deployment-example.<project>.<router_domain>` to verify you see the `v1` image.

. Scale the `DeploymentConfig` object up to three replicas:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale dc/deployment-example --replicas=3
----

. Trigger a new deployment automatically by tagging a new version of the example as the `latest` tag:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc tag deployment-example:v2 deployment-example:latest
----

. In your browser, refresh the page until you see the `v2` image.

. When using the CLI, the following command shows how many pods are on version 1 and how many are on version 2. In the web console, the pods are progressively added to v2 and removed from v1:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe dc deployment-example
----

During the deployment process, the new replication controller is incrementally scaled up. After the new pods are marked as `ready` (by passing their readiness check), the deployment process continues.

If the pods do not become ready, the process aborts, and the deployment rolls back to its previous version.

[id="deployments-recreate-strategy_{context}"]
= Recreate strategy

The recreate strategy has basic rollout behavior and supports lifecycle hooks for injecting code into the deployment process.

.Example recreate strategy definition
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Recreate
  recreateParams: <1>
    pre: {} <2>
    mid: {}
    post: {}
----

<1> `recreateParams` are optional.
<2> `pre`, `mid`, and `post` are lifecycle hooks.

The recreate strategy:

. Executes any `pre` lifecycle hook.
. Scales down the previous deployment to zero.
. Executes any `mid` lifecycle hook.
. Scales up the new deployment.
. Executes any `post` lifecycle hook.

[IMPORTANT]
====
During scale up, if the replica count of the deployment is greater than one, the first replica of the deployment will be validated for readiness before fully scaling up the deployment. If the validation of the first replica fails, the deployment will be considered a failure.
====

*When to use a recreate deployment:*

- When you must run migrations or other data transformations before your new code starts.
- When you do not support having new and old versions of your application code running at the same time.
- When you want to use a RWO volume, which is not supported being shared between multiple replicas.

A recreate deployment incurs downtime because, for a brief period, no instances of your application are running. However, your old code and new code do not run at the same time.

// Custom strategies
:leveloffset: +1

// Module included in the following assemblies:

[id="deployments-custom-strategy_{context}"]
= Custom strategy

The custom strategy allows you to provide your own deployment behavior.

.Example custom strategy definition
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Custom
  customParams:
    image: organization/strategy
    command: [ "command", "arg1" ]
    environment:
      - name: ENV_1
        value: VALUE_1
----

In the above example, the `organization/strategy` container image provides the deployment behavior. The optional `command` array overrides any `CMD` directive specified in the image's `Dockerfile`. The optional environment variables provided are added to the execution environment of the strategy process.

Additionally, {product-title} provides the following environment variables to the deployment process:

[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===
|Environment variable |Description

.^|`OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`
|The name of the new deployment, a replication controller.

.^|`OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAMESPACE`
|The name space of the new deployment.
|===

The replica count of the new deployment will initially be zero. The responsibility of the strategy is to make the new deployment active using the
logic that best serves the needs of the user.

Alternatively, use the `customParams` object to inject the custom deployment logic into the existing deployment strategies. Provide a custom shell script logic and call the `openshift-deploy` binary. Users do not have to supply their custom deployer container image; in this case, the default {product-title} deployer image is used instead:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Rolling
  customParams:
    command:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - |
      set -e
      openshift-deploy --until=50%
      echo Halfway there
      openshift-deploy
      echo Complete
----

This results in following deployment:

[source,terminal]
----
Started deployment #2
--> Scaling up custom-deployment-2 from 0 to 2, scaling down custom-deployment-1 from 2 to 0 (keep 2 pods available, don't exceed 3 pods)
    Scaling custom-deployment-2 up to 1
--> Reached 50% (currently 50%)
Halfway there
--> Scaling up custom-deployment-2 from 1 to 2, scaling down custom-deployment-1 from 2 to 0 (keep 2 pods available, don't exceed 3 pods)
    Scaling custom-deployment-1 down to 1
    Scaling custom-deployment-2 up to 2
    Scaling custom-deployment-1 down to 0
--> Success
Complete
----

If the custom deployment strategy process requires access to the {product-title} API or the Kubernetes API the container that executes the strategy can use the service account token available inside the container for authentication.

[id="deployments-lifecycle-hooks_{context}"]
= Lifecycle hooks

The rolling and recreate strategies support _lifecycle hooks_, or deployment hooks, which allow behavior to be injected into the deployment process at predefined points within the strategy:

.Example `pre` lifecycle hook
[source,yaml]
----
pre:
  failurePolicy: Abort
  execNewPod: {} <1>
----
<1> `execNewPod` is a pod-based lifecycle hook.

Every hook has a _failure policy_, which defines the action the strategy should take when a hook failure is encountered:

[cols="2,8"]
|===

.^|`Abort`
|The deployment process will be considered a failure if the hook fails.

.^|`Retry`
|The hook execution should be retried until it succeeds.

.^|`Ignore`
|Any hook failure should be ignored and the deployment should proceed.
|===

Hooks have a type-specific field that describes how to execute the hook. Currently, pod-based hooks are the only supported hook type, specified by the `execNewPod` field.

[discrete]
==== Pod-based lifecycle hook

Pod-based lifecycle hooks execute hook code in a new pod derived from the template in a `DeploymentConfig` object.

        execNewPod:
          containerName: helloworld <1>
          command: [ "/usr/bin/command", "arg1", "arg2" ] <2>
          env: <3>
            - name: CUSTOM_VAR1
              value: custom_value1
          volumes:
            - data <4>
----
<1> The `helloworld` name refers to `spec.template.spec.containers[0].name`.
<2> This `command` overrides any `ENTRYPOINT` defined by the `openshift/origin-ruby-sample` image.
<3> `env` is an optional set of environment variables for the hook container.
<4> `volumes` is an optional set of volume references for the hook container.

In this example, the `pre` hook will be executed in a new pod using the `openshift/origin-ruby-sample` image from the `helloworld` container. The hook pod has the following properties:

* The hook command is `/usr/bin/command arg1 arg2`.
* The hook container has the `CUSTOM_VAR1=custom_value1` environment variable.
* The hook failure policy is `Abort`, meaning the deployment process fails if the hook fails.
* The hook pod inherits the `data` volume from the `DeploymentConfig` object pod.

== Setting lifecycle hooks

You can set lifecycle hooks, or deployment hooks, for a deployment using the CLI.

.Procedure

. Use the `oc set deployment-hook` command to set the type of hook you want: `--pre`, `--mid`, or `--post`. For example, to set a pre-deployment hook:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set deployment-hook dc/frontend \
    --pre -c helloworld -e CUSTOM_VAR1=custom_value1 \
    --volumes data --failure-policy=abort -- /usr/bin/command arg1 arg2
