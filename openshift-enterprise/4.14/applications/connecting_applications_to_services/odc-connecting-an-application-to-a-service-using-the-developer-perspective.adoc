Use the *Topology* view for the following purposes:

** Group multiple components within an application.

** Connect components with each other.

** Connect multiple resources to services with labels.

You can either use a binding or a visual connector to connect components.


A binding connection between the components can be established only if the target node is an Operator-backed service. This is indicated by the *Create a binding connector* tool-tip which appears when you drag an arrow to such a target node. When an application is connected to a service by using a binding connector a `ServiceBinding` resource is created. Then, the {servicebinding-title} controller projects the necessary binding data into the application deployment. After the request is successful, the application is redeployed establishing an interaction between the connected components.

A visual connector establishes only a visual connection between the components, depicting an intent to connect. No interaction between the components is established. If the target node is not an Operator-backed service the *Create a visual connector* tool-tip is displayed when you drag an arrow to a target node.

[id="odc-discovering-and-identifying-operator-backed-bindable-services_{context}"]
= Discovering and identifying Operator-backed bindable services

As a user, if you want to create a bindable service, you must know which services are bindable. Bindable services are services that the applications can consume easily because they expose their binding data such as credentials, connection details, volume mounts, secrets, and other binding data in a standard way. The *Developer* perspective helps you discover and identify such bindable services.

.Procedure
* To discover and identify Operator-backed bindable services, consider the following alternative approaches:
+
** Click *+Add* -> *Developer Catalog* -> *Operator Backed* to see the Operator-backed tiles. Operator-backed services that support service binding features have a *Bindable* badge on the tiles.
** On the left pane of the *Operator Backed* page, select the *Bindable* checkbox.
+
[TIP]
====
Click the help icon next to *Service binding* to see more information about bindable services.
====

** Click  *+Add* -> *Add* and search for Operator-backed services. When you click the bindable service, you can view the *Bindable* badge in the side panel to the right.

[id="odc-creating-a-visual-connection-between-components_{context}"]
= Creating a visual connection between components

You can depict an intent to connect application components by using the visual connector.

This procedure walks you through an example of creating a visual connection between a PostgreSQL Database service and a Spring PetClinic sample application.

.Prerequisites

* You have created and deployed a Spring PetClinic sample application by using the *Developer* perspective.
* You have created and deployed a Crunchy PostgreSQL database instance by using the *Developer* perspective. This instance has the following components: `hippo-backup`, `hippo-instance`, `hippo-repo-host`, and  `hippo-pgbouncer`.

.Procedure

. Hover over the Spring PetClinic sample application to see a dangling arrow on the node.
+
.Visual connector
image::odc_connector.png[]
. Click and drag the arrow towards the `hippo-pgbouncer` deployment to connect the Spring PetClinic sample application with it.
. Click the `spring-petclinic` deployment to see the *Overview* panel. Under the *Details* tab, click the edit icon in the *Annotations* section to see the *Key = `app.openshift.io/connects-to`* and *Value = `[{"apiVersion":"apps/v1","kind":"Deployment","name":"hippo-pgbouncer"}]`* annotation added to the deployment.

. Optional: You can repeat these steps to establish visual connections between other applications and components you create.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="odc-creating-a-binding-connection-between-components_{context}"]
= Creating a binding connection between components

You can create a binding connection with Operator-backed components, as demonstrated in the following example, which uses a PostgreSQL Database service and a Spring PetClinic sample application. To create a binding connection with a service that the PostgreSQL Database Operator backs, you must first add the Red Hat-provided PostgreSQL Database Operator to the *OperatorHub*, and then install the Operator. The PostreSQL Database Operator then creates and manages the Database resource, which exposes the binding data in secrets, config maps, status, and spec attributes.

.Prerequisites

* You created and deployed a Spring PetClinic sample application in the *Developer* perspective.
* You installed {servicebinding-title} from the *OperatorHub*.
* You installed the *Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes* Operator from the OperatorHub in the `v5` *Update* channel.
* You created a *PostgresCluster* resource in the *Developer* perspective, which resulted in a Crunchy PostgreSQL database instance with the following components: `hippo-backup`, `hippo-instance`, `hippo-repo-host`, and `hippo-pgbouncer`.

.Procedure

. In the *Developer* perspective, switch to the relevant project, for example, `my-petclinic`.
. In the *Topology* view, hover over the Spring PetClinic sample application to see a dangling arrow on the node.
. Drag and drop the arrow onto the *hippo* database icon in the Postgres Cluster to make a binding connection with the Spring PetClinic sample application.

. In the *Create Service Binding* dialog, keep the default name or add a different name for the service binding, and then click *Create*.
+
.Service Binding dialog
image::odc-sbc-modal.png[]
. Optional: If there is difficulty in making a binding connection using the Topology view, go to *+Add* -> *YAML* -> *Import YAML*.
. Optional: In the YAML editor, add the `ServiceBinding` resource:
+
[source,YAML]
----
apiVersion: binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
    name: spring-petclinic-pgcluster
    namespace: my-petclinic
spec:
    services:
    - group: postgres-operator.crunchydata.com
      version: v1beta1
      kind: PostgresCluster
      name: hippo
    application:
      name: spring-petclinic
      group: apps
      version: v1
      resource: deployments
----
+
A service binding request is created and a binding connection is created through a `ServiceBinding` resource. When the database service connection request succeeds, the application is redeployed and the connection is established.
+
.Binding connector
image::odc-binding-connector.png[]
+
[TIP]
====
You can also use the context menu by dragging the dangling arrow to add and create a binding connection to an operator-backed service.

.Context menu to create binding connection
image::odc_context_operator.png[]
====

. In the navigation menu, click *Topology*. The spring-petclinic deployment in the Topology view includes an Open URL link to view its web page.

. Click the *Open URL* link.

You can now view the Spring PetClinic sample application remotely to confirm that the application is now connected to the database service and that the data has been successfully projected to the application from the Crunchy PostgreSQL database service.

The Service Binding Operator has successfully created a working connection between the application and the database service.

[id="odc-verifying-the-status-of-your-service-binding-from-the-topology-view_{context}"]
= Verifying the status of your service binding from the Topology view

The *Developer* perspective helps you verify the status of your service binding through the *Topology* view.

.Procedure

. If a service binding was successful, click the binding connector. A side panel appears displaying the *Connected* status under the *Details* tab.
+
Optionally, you can view the *Connected* status on the following pages from the *Developer* perspective:
+
** The *ServiceBindings* page.
** The *ServiceBinding details* page. In addition, the page title displays a *Connected* badge.
. If a service binding was unsuccessful, the binding connector shows a red arrowhead and a red cross in the middle of the connection. Click this connector to view the *Error* status in the side panel under the *Details* tab. Optionally, click the *Error* status to view specific information about the underlying problem.
+
You can also view the *Error* status and a tooltip on the following pages from the *Developer* perspective:
+
** The *ServiceBindings* page.
** The *ServiceBinding details* page. In addition, the page title displays an *Error* badge.


[TIP]
====
In the *ServiceBindings* page, use the *Filter* dropdown to list the service bindings based on their status.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="odc-visualizing-the-binding-connections-to-resources_{context}"]
= Visualizing the binding connections to resources

As a user, use *Label Selector* in the *Topology* view to visualize a service binding and simplify the process of binding applications to backing services. When creating `ServiceBinding` resources, specify labels by using *Label Selector* to find and connect applications instead of using the name of the application. The Service Binding Operator then consumes these `ServiceBinding` resources and specified labels to find the applications to create a service binding with.


[TIP]
====
To navigate to a list of all connected resources, click the label selector associated with the `ServiceBinding` resource.
====

To view the *Label Selector*, consider the following approaches:

** After you import a `ServiceBinding` resource, view the *Label Selector* associated with the service binding on the *ServiceBinding details* page.

+
.ServiceBinding details page
image::odc-label-selector-sb-details.png[]

[NOTE]
====
To use *Label Selector* and to create one or more connections at once, you must import the YAML file of the `ServiceBinding` resource.
====

** After the connection is established and when you click the binding connector, the service binding connector *Details* side panel appears. You can view the *Label Selector* associated with the service binding on this panel.

+
.Topology label selector side panel
image::odc-label-selector-topology-side-panel.png[]

+
[NOTE]
====
When you delete a binding connector (a single connection within *Topology* along with a service binding), the action removes all connections that are tied to the deleted service binding. While deleting a binding connector, a confirmation dialog appears, which informs that all connectors will be deleted.
