:context: servicebinding-release-notes

toc::[]

The {servicebinding-title} consists of a controller and an accompanying custom resource definition (CRD) for service binding. It manages the data plane for workloads and backing services. The Service Binding Controller reads the data made available by the control plane of backing services. Then, it projects this data to workloads according to the rules specified through the `ServiceBinding` resource.

With {servicebinding-title}, you can:

* Bind your workloads together with Operator-managed backing services.
* Automate configuration of binding data.
* Provide service operators a low-touch administrative experience to provision and manage access to services.
* Enrich development lifecycle with a consistent and declarative service binding method that eliminates discrepancies in cluster environments.

The custom resource definition (CRD) of the {servicebinding-title} supports the following APIs:

* *Service Binding* with the `binding.operators.coreos.com` API group.
* *Service Binding (Spec API)* with the `servicebinding.io` API group.

[id="servicebinding-inclusive-language"]
== Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[Red Hat CTO Chris Wright's message].

[id="fixed-issues-1-3-3_{context}"]
== Fixed issues
* Before this update, a security vulnerability `CVE-2022-41717` was noted for {servicebinding-title}. This update fixes the `CVE-2022-41717` error and updates the `golang.org/x/net` package from v0.0.0-20220906165146-f3363e06e74c to v0.4.0. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSVC-1256[APPSVC-1256]

* Before this update, Provisioned Services were only detected if the respective resource had the "servicebinding.io/provisioned-service: true" annotation set while other Provisioned Services were missed. With this update, the detection mechanism identifies all Provisioned Services correctly based on the "status.binding.name" attribute. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSVC-1204[APPSVC-1204]

[id="new-features-1-2_{context}"]
== New features
This section highlights what is new in {servicebinding-title} 1.2:

* Enable {servicebinding-title} to consider optional fields in the annotations by setting the `optional` flag value to `true`.
* Support for `servicebinding.io/v1beta1` resources.
* Improvements to the discoverability of bindable services by exposing the relevant binding secret without requiring a workload to be present.

[id="known-issues-1-2_{context}"]
== Known issues
* Currently, when you install {servicebinding-title} on {product-title} 4.11, the memory footprint of {servicebinding-title} increases beyond expected limits. With low usage, however, the memory footprint stays within the expected ranges of your environment or scenarios. In comparison with {product-title} 4.10, under stress, both the average and maximum memory footprint increase considerably. This issue is evident in the previous versions of {servicebinding-title} as well. There is currently no workaround for this issue. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSVC-1200[APPSVC-1200]

* By default, the projected files get their permissions set to 0644. {servicebinding-title} cannot set specific permissions due to a bug in Kubernetes that causes issues if the service expects specific permissions such as, `0600`. As a workaround, you can modify the code of the program or the application that is running inside a workload resource to copy the file to the `/tmp` directory and set the appropriate permissions. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSVC-1127[APPSVC-1127]

* There is currently a known issue with installing {servicebinding-title} in a single namespace installation mode. The absence of an appropriate namespace-scoped role-based access control (RBAC) rule prevents the successful binding of an application to a few known Operator-backed services that the {servicebinding-title} can automatically detect and bind to. When this happens, it generates an error message similar to the following example:
+
.Example error message

`postgresclusters.postgres-operator.crunchydata.com "hippo" is forbidden:
        User "system:serviceaccount:my-petclinic:service-binding-operator" cannot

        in the namespace "my-petclinic"`
----
+
Workaround 1: Install the {servicebinding-title} in the `all namespaces` installation mode. As a result, the appropriate cluster-scoped RBAC rule now exists and the binding succeeds.
+
Workaround 2: If you cannot install the {servicebinding-title} in the `all namespaces` installation mode, install the following role binding into the namespace where the {servicebinding-title} is installed:

* According to the specification, when you change the `ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping` resources, {servicebinding-title} must use the previous version of the `ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping` resource to remove the binding data that was being projected until now. Currently, when you change the `ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping` resources, the {servicebinding-title} uses the latest version of the `ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping` resource to remove the binding data. As a result, {the servicebinding-title} might remove the binding data incorrectly. As a workaround, perform the following steps:
+
--
. Delete any `ServiceBinding` resources that use the corresponding `ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping` resource.
. Modify the `ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping` resource.
. Re-apply the `ServiceBinding` resources that you previously removed in step 1.

* Before this update, a security vulnerability `CVE-2021-38561` was noted for {servicebinding-title} Helm chart. This update fixes the `CVE-2021-38561` error and updates the `golang.org/x/text` package from v0.3.6 to v0.3.7. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSVC-1124[APPSVC-1124]

* Before this update, users of the Developer Sandbox did not have sufficient permissions to read `ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping` resources. As a result, {servicebinding-title} prevented all service bindings from being successful. With this update, the {servicebinding-title} now includes the appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) rules for any authenticated subject including the Developer Sandbox users. These RBAC rules allow the {servicebinding-title} to `get`, `list`, and `watch` the `ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping` resources for the Developer Sandbox users and to process service bindings successfully. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSVC-1135[APPSVC-1135]

** Bind new workloads using a label selector.


[id="fixed-issues-1-1_{context}"]

* Before this update, service bindings that used label selectors to pick up workloads did not project service binding data into the new workloads that matched the given label selectors. As a result, the Service Binding Operator could not periodically bind such new workloads. With this update, service bindings now project service binding data into the new workloads that match the given label selector.

== Fixed issues
* Before this update, binding the data values from a `Cluster` custom resource (CR) of the `postgresql.k8s.enterpriesedb.io/v1` API collected the `host` binding value from the `.metadata.name` field of the CR. The collected binding value is an incorrect hostname and the correct hostname is available at the `.status.writeService` field. With this update, the annotations that the {servicebinding-title} uses to expose the binding data values from the backing service CR are now modified to collect the `host` binding value from the `.status.writeService` field. The {servicebinding-title} uses these modified annotations to project the correct hostname in the `host` and `provider` bindings. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSVC-1040[APPSVC-1040]
* Before this update, when you would bind a `PostgresCluster` CR of the `postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/v1beta1` API, the binding data values did not include the values for the database certificates. As a result, the application failed to connect to the database. With this update, modifications to the annotations that the {servicebinding-title} uses to expose the binding data from the backing service CR now include the database certificates. The {servicebinding-title} uses these modified annotations to project the correct `ca.crt`, `tls.crt`, and `tls.key` certificate files. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSVC-1045[APPSVC-1045]
* Before this update, when you would bind a `PerconaXtraDBCluster` custom resource (CR) of the `pxc.percona.com` API, the binding data values did not include the `port` and `database` values. These binding values along with the others already projected are necessary for an application to successfully connect to the database service. With this update, the annotations that the {servicebinding-title} uses to expose the binding data values from the backing service CR are now modified to project the additional `port` and `database` binding values. The {servicebinding-title} uses these modified annotations to project the complete set of binding values that the application can use to successfully connect to the database service. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSVC-1073[APPSVC-1073]


[id="known-issues-1-0-1_{context}"]
== Known issues
* Currently, when you install the {servicebinding-title} in the single namespace installation mode, the absence of an appropriate namespace-scoped role-based access control (RBAC) rule prevents the successful binding of an application to a few known Operator-backed services that the {servicebinding-title} can automatically detect and bind to. In addition, the following error message is generated:
+
.Example error message
----
`postgresclusters.postgres-operator.crunchydata.com "hippo" is forbidden:
        User "system:serviceaccount:my-petclinic:service-binding-operator" cannot
        get resource "postgresclusters" in API group "postgres-operator.crunchydata.com"
        in the namespace "my-petclinic"`
----
+
Workaround 1: Install the {servicebinding-title} in the `all namespaces` installation mode. As a result, the appropriate cluster-scoped RBAC rule now exists and the binding succeeds.
+
Workaround 2: If you cannot install the {servicebinding-title} in the `all namespaces` installation mode, install the following role binding into the namespace where the {servicebinding-title} is installed:
+
