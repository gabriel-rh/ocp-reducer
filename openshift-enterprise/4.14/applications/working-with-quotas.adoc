toc::[]

A _resource quota_, defined by a ResourceQuota object, provides constraints that
limit aggregate resource consumption per project. It can limit the quantity of
objects that can be created in a project by type, as well as the total amount of
compute resources and storage that may be consumed by resources in that project.

An _object quota count_ places a defined quota on all standard namespaced resource
types. When using a resource quota, an object is charged against the quota if it
exists in server storage. These types of quotas are useful to protect against
exhaustion of storage resources.

This guide describes how resource quotas work and how developers can work with
and view them.

[id="quota-viewing-quotas_{context}"]
= Viewing a quota

You can view usage statistics related to any hard limits defined in a project's
quota by navigating in the web console to the project's *Quota* page.

You can also use the CLI to view quota details.

.Procedure

. Get the list of quotas defined in the project. For example, for a project called
`demoproject`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get quota -n demoproject
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                AGE
besteffort          11m
compute-resources   2m
core-object-counts  29m
----

. Describe the quota you are interested in, for example the `core-object-counts`
quota:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe quota core-object-counts -n demoproject
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Name:			core-object-counts
Namespace:		demoproject
Resource		Used	Hard
--------		----	----
configmaps		3	10
persistentvolumeclaims	0	4
replicationcontrollers	3	20
secrets			9	10
services		2	10

[id="quotas-scopes_{context}"]
= Quota scopes

Each quota can have an associated set of _scopes_. A quota only measures usage
for a resource if it matches the intersection of enumerated scopes.

Adding a scope to a quota restricts the set of resources to which that quota can
apply. Specifying a resource outside of the allowed set results in a validation
error.

|===

|Scope |Description

|`BestEffort`
|Match pods that have best effort quality of service for either `cpu` or
`memory`.

|`NotBestEffort`
|Match pods that do not have best effort quality of service for `cpu` and
`memory`.
|===

A `BestEffort` scope restricts a quota to limiting the following resources:

- `pods`

A `NotBestEffort` scope restricts a quota to tracking the following resources:

- `pods`
- `memory`
- `requests.memory`
- `limits.memory`
- `cpu`
- `requests.cpu`
- `limits.cpu`

[id="quota-enforcement_{context}"]
= Quota enforcement

After a resource quota for a project is first created, the project restricts the
ability to create any new resources that may violate a quota constraint until it
has calculated updated usage statistics.

After a quota is created and usage statistics are updated, the project accepts
the creation of new content. When you create or modify resources, your quota
usage is incremented immediately upon the request to create or modify the
resource.

When you delete a resource, your quota use is decremented during the next full
recalculation of quota statistics for the project. A configurable amount of time
determines how long it takes to reduce quota usage statistics to their current
observed system value.

If project modifications exceed a quota usage limit, the server denies the
action, and an appropriate error message is returned to the user explaining the
quota constraint violated, and what their currently observed usage statistics
are in the system.

[id="quotas-requests-vs-limits_{context}"]
= Requests versus limits

When allocating compute resources, each container might specify a request and a
limit value each for CPU, memory, and ephemeral storage. Quotas can restrict any
of these values.

If the quota has a value specified for `requests.cpu` or `requests.memory`,
then it requires that every incoming container make an explicit request for
those resources. If the quota has a value specified for `limits.cpu` or
`limits.memory`, then it requires that every incoming container specify an
explicit limit for those resources.
