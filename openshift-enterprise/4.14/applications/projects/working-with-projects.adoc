A _project_ allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in
isolation from other communities.

[NOTE]
====
Projects starting with `openshift-` and `kube-` are  xref:../../authentication/using-rbac.adoc#rbac-default-projects_using-rbac[default projects]. These projects host cluster components that run as pods and other infrastructure components. As such, {product-title} does not allow you to create projects starting with `openshift-` or `kube-` using the `oc new-project` command. Cluster administrators can create these projects using the `oc adm new-project` command.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not run workloads in or share access to default projects. Default projects are reserved for running core cluster components.

The following default projects are considered highly privileged: `default`, `kube-public`, `kube-system`, `openshift`, `openshift-infra`, `openshift-node`, and other system-created projects that have the `openshift.io/run-level` label set to `0` or `1`. Functionality that relies on admission plugins, such as pod security admission, security context constraints, cluster resource quotas, and image reference resolution, does not work in highly privileged projects.

You can create a project using the *Developer* perspective, as follows:

. Click the *Project* drop-down menu to see a list of all available projects. Select *Create Project*.
+
.Create project
image::odc_create_project.png[]

. In the *Create Project* dialog box, enter a unique name, such as `myproject`, in the *Name* field.
. Optional: Add the *Display Name* and *Description* details for the project.
. Click *Create*.
. Use the left navigation panel to navigate to the *Project* view and see the dashboard for your project.
. Optional:
+
* Use the *Project* drop-down menu at the top of the screen and select *all projects* to list all of the projects in your cluster.
* Use the *Details* tab to see the project details.
* If you have adequate permissions for a project, you can use the *Project Access* tab to provide or revoke _administrator_, _edit_, and _view_ privileges for the project.

[id="odc-customizing-available-cluster-roles-using-developer-perspective_{context}"]
= Customizing the available cluster roles using the Developer perspective

The users of a project are assigned to a cluster role based on their access control. You can access these cluster roles by navigating to the *Project* -> *Project access* -> *Role*. By default, these roles are *Admin*, *Edit*, and *View*.

To add or edit the cluster roles for a project, you can customize the YAML code of the cluster.

.Procedure
To customize the different cluster roles of a project:

. In the *Search* view, use the *Resources* drop-down list to search for `Console`.
. From the available options, select the *Console `operator.openshift.io/v1`*.
+

When you delete a project, the server updates the project status to
*Terminating* from *Active*. Then, the server clears all content from a project
that is in the *Terminating* state before finally removing the project. While a
project is in *Terminating* status, you cannot add new content to the project.
Projects can be deleted from the CLI or the web console.
