[id="odc-monitoring-your-project-metrics_{context}"]
= Monitoring your project metrics

After you create applications in your project and deploy them, you can use the *Developer* perspective in the web console to see the metrics for your project.

.Procedure

. On the left navigation panel of the *Developer* perspective, click *Observe* to see the *Dashboard*, *Metrics*, *Alerts*, and *Events* for your project.
+
. Optional: Use the *Dashboard* tab to see graphs depicting the following application metrics:
+
--
* CPU usage
* Memory usage
* Bandwidth consumption
* Network-related information such as the rate of transmitted and received packets and the rate of dropped packets.
--
+
In the *Dashboard* tab, you can access the Kubernetes compute resources dashboards.
+
.Observe dashboard
image::odc_observe_dashboard.png[]
+
[NOTE]
====
In the *Dashboard* list, *Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Namespace (Pods)* dashboard is selected by default.
====
+
Use the following options to see further details:

** Select a dashboard from the *Dashboard* list to see the filtered metrics. All dashboards produce additional sub-menus when selected, except *Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Namespace (Pods)*.
** Select an option from the *Time Range* list to determine the time frame for the data being captured.
** Set a custom time range by selecting *Custom time range* from the *Time Range* list. You can input or select the *From* and *To* dates and times. Click *Save* to save the custom time range.
** Select an option from the *Refresh Interval* list to determine the time period after which the data is refreshed.
** Hover your cursor over the graphs to see specific details for your pod.
** Click *Inspect* located in the upper-right corner of every graph to see any particular graph details. The graph details appear in the *Metrics* tab.

. Optional: Use the *Metrics* tab to query for the required project metric.
+
.Monitoring metrics
image::odc_project_metrics.png[]
+
.. In the *Select Query* list, select an option to filter the required details for your project. The filtered metrics for all the application pods in your project are displayed in the graph. The pods in your project are also listed below.
.. From the list of pods, clear the colored square boxes to remove the metrics for specific pods to further filter your query result.
.. Click *Show PromQL* to see the Prometheus query. You can further modify this query with the help of prompts to customize the query and filter the metrics you want to see for that namespace.
.. Use the drop-down list to set a time range for the data being displayed. You can click *Reset Zoom* to reset it to the default time range.
.. Optional: In the *Select Query* list, select *Custom Query* to create a custom Prometheus query and filter relevant metrics.

. Optional: Use the *Alerts* tab to do the following tasks:
+
--
* See the rules that trigger alerts for the applications in your project.
* Identify the alerts firing in the project.
* Silence such alerts if required.
--
+
.Monitoring alerts
image::odc_project_alerts.png[]
+
Use the following options to see further details:

** Use the *Filter* list to filter the alerts by their *Alert State* and *Severity*.

** Click on an alert to go to the details page for that alert. In the *Alerts Details* page, you can click *View Metrics* to see the metrics for the alert.

** Use the *Notifications* toggle adjoining an alert rule to silence all the alerts for that rule, and then select the duration for which the alerts will be silenced from the *Silence for* list.
You must have the permissions to edit alerts to see the *Notifications* toggle.

** Use the *Options* menu {kebab} adjoining an alert rule to see the details of the alerting rule.

. Optional: Use the *Events* tab to see the events for your project.
+
.Monitoring events
image::odc_project_events.png[]
+
You can filter the displayed events using the following options:

** In the *Resources* list, select a resource to see events for that resource.
** In the *All Types* list, select a type of event to see events relevant to that type.
** Search for specific events using the *Filter events by names or messages* field.

[id="odc-monitoring-your-application-metrics_{context}"]
= Monitoring your application metrics

After you create applications in your project and deploy them, you can use the *Topology* view in the *Developer* perspective to see the alerts and metrics for your application. Critical and warning alerts for your application are indicated on the workload node in the *Topology* view.

.Procedure
To see the alerts for your workload:

. In the *Topology* view, click the workload to see the workload details in the right panel.
. Click the *Observe* tab to see the critical and warning alerts for the application; graphs for metrics, such as CPU, memory, and bandwidth usage; and all the events for the application.
+
[NOTE]
====
Only critical and warning alerts in the *Firing* state are displayed in the *Topology* view. Alerts in the *Silenced*, *Pending* and *Not Firing* states are not displayed.
====
+
.Monitoring application metrics
image::odc_app_metrics.png[]
+
.. Click the alert listed in the right panel to see the alert details in the *Alert Details* page.
.. Click any of the charts to go to the *Metrics* tab to see the detailed metrics for the application.
.. Click *View monitoring dashboard* to see the monitoring dashboard for that application.

[id="odc-image-vulnerabilities-breakdown_{context}"]
= Image vulnerabilities breakdown

In the developer perspective, the project dashboard shows the *Image Vulnerabilities* link in the *Status* section. Using this link, you can view the *Image Vulnerabilities breakdown* window, which includes details regarding vulnerable container images and fixable container images. The icon color indicates severity:

* Red: High priority. Fix immediately.
* Orange: Medium priority. Can be fixed after high-priority vulnerabilities.
* Yellow: Low priority. Can be fixed after high and medium-priority vulnerabilities.

Based on the severity level, you can prioritize vulnerabilities and fix them in an organized manner.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="odc-monitoring-your-application-image-vulnerabilities-metrics_{context}"]
= Monitoring your application and image vulnerabilities metrics

After you create applications in your project and deploy them, use the *Developer* perspective in the web console to see the metrics for your application dependency vulnerabilities across your cluster. The metrics help you to analyze the following image vulnerabilities in detail:

* Total count of vulnerable images in a selected project
* Severity-based counts of all vulnerable images in a selected project
* Drilldown into severity to obtain the details, such as count of vulnerabilities, count of fixable vulnerabilities, and number of affected pods for each vulnerable image

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the Red Hat Quay Container Security operator from the Operator Hub.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Red Hat Quay Container Security operator detects vulnerabilities by scanning the images that are in the quay registry.
====

.Procedure

. For a general overview of the image vulnerabilities, on the navigation panel of the *Developer* perspective, click *Project* to see the project dashboard.

. Click *Image Vulnerabilities* in the *Status* section. The window that opens displays details such as *Vulnerable Container Images* and *Fixable Container Images*.

. For a detailed vulnerabilities overview, click the *Vulnerabilities* tab on the project dashboard.

.. To get more detail about an image, click its name.

.. View the default graph with all types of vulnerabilities in the *Details* tab.

.. Optional: Click the toggle button to view a specific type of vulnerability. For example, click *App dependency* to see vulnerabilities specific to application dependency.

.. Optional: You can filter the list of vulnerabilities based on their *Severity* and *Type* or sort them by *Severity*, *Package*, *Type*, *Source*, *Current Version*, and *Fixed in Version*.

.. Click a *Vulnerability* to get its associated details:
+
* *Base image* vulnerabilities display information from a Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA).
* *App dependency* vulnerabilities display information from the Snyk security application.
