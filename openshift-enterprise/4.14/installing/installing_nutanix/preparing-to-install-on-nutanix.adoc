Before you install an {product-title} cluster, be sure that your Nutanix environment meets the following requirements.

:leveloffset: +1

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * installing/installing_nutanix/preparing-to-install-nutanix.adoc

= Nutanix version requirements

You must install the {product-title} cluster to a Nutanix environment that meets the following requirements.

= Environment requirements

Before you install an {product-title} cluster, review the following Nutanix AOS environment requirements.

[id="installation-nutanix-installer-infra-reqs-account_{context}"]
== Required account privileges

The installation program requires access to a Nutanix account with the necessary permissions to deploy the cluster and to maintain the daily operation of it. The following options are available to you:

* You can use a local Prism Central user account with administrative privileges. Using a local account is the quickest way to grant access to an account with the required permissions.
* If your organizationâ€™s security policies require that you use a more restrictive set of permissions, use the permissions that are listed in the following table to create a custom Cloud Native role in Prism Central. You can then assign the role to a user account that is a member of a Prism Central authentication directory.

Consider the following when managing this user account:

* When assigning entities to the role, ensure that the user can access only the Prism Element and subnet that are required to deploy the virtual machines.
* Ensure that the user is a member of the project to which it needs to assign virtual machines.

For more information, see the Nutanix documentation about creating a link:https://opendocs.nutanix.com/guides/cloud_native_role/[Custom Cloud Native role], link:https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Nutanix-Security-Guide:ssp-ssp-role-assignment-pc-t.html[assigning a role], and link:https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Prism-Central-Admin-Center-Guide-vpc_2023_1_0_1:ssp-projects-add-users-t.html[adding a user to a project].

[id="installation-nutanix-installer-infra-reqs-limits_{context}"]
== Cluster limits

Available resources vary between clusters. The number of possible clusters within a Nutanix environment is limited primarily by available storage space and any limitations associated with the resources that the cluster creates, and resources that you require to deploy the cluster, such a IP addresses and networks.

[id="installation-nutanix-installer-infra-reqs-resources_{context}"]
== Cluster resources

A minimum of 800 GB of storage is required to use a standard cluster.

When you deploy a {product-title} cluster that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure, the installation program must be able to create several resources in your Nutanix instance. Although these resources use 856 GB of storage, the bootstrap node is destroyed as part of the installation process.

A standard {product-title} installation creates the following resources:

* 1 label
* Virtual machines:
** 1 disk image
** 1 temporary bootstrap node
** 3 control plane nodes
** 3 compute machines

[id="installation-nutanix-installer-infra-requirements-networking_{context}"]
== Networking requirements

You must use either AHV IP Address Management (IPAM) or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for the network and ensure that it is configured to provide persistent IP addresses to the cluster machines. Additionally, create the following networking resources before you install the {product-title} cluster:

* IP addresses
* DNS records

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended that each {product-title} node in the cluster have access to a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server that is discoverable via DHCP. Installation is possible without an NTP server. However, an NTP server prevents errors typically associated with asynchronous server clocks.
====

[id="installation-nutanix-installer-infra-reqs-_{context}"]
=== Required IP Addresses
An installer-provisioned installation requires two static virtual IP (VIP) addresses:

* A VIP address for the API is required. This address is used to access the cluster API.
* A VIP address for ingress is required. This address is used for cluster ingress traffic.

You specify these IP addresses when you install the {product-title} cluster.

[id="installation-nutanix-installer-infra-reqs-dns-records_{context}"]
=== DNS records
You must create DNS records for two static IP addresses in the appropriate DNS server for the Nutanix instance that hosts your {product-title} cluster. In each record, `<cluster_name>` is the cluster name and `<base_domain>` is the cluster base domain that you specify when you install the cluster.

A complete DNS record takes the form: `<component>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`.

.Required DNS records
[cols="1a,5a,3a",options="header"]
|===

|Component
|Record
|Description

|API VIP
|`api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|This DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record must point to the load balancer
for the control plane machines. This record must be resolvable by both clients
external to the cluster and from all the nodes within the cluster.

|Ingress VIP
|`*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|A wildcard DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record that points to the load balancer that targets the
machines that run the Ingress router pods, which are the worker nodes by
default. This record must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster
and from all the nodes within the cluster.

= Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility
= Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility for a cluster update

//This applies only to Alibaba Cloud.

//Nutanix-only intro because it needs context in its install procedure.
The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) manages cloud provider credentials as Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs). To install a cluster on Nutanix, you must set the CCO to `manual` mode as part of the installation process.

//Alibaba Cloud uses ccoctl, but creates different kinds of resources than other clouds, so this applies to everyone else. The upgrade procs also have a different intro, so they are excluded here.
To create and manage cloud credentials from outside of the cluster when the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is operating in manual mode, extract and prepare the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) binary.

//Intro for the upgrade procs.

[NOTE]
====
The `ccoctl` utility is a Linux binary that must run in a Linux environment.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} account with cluster administrator access.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

//Upgrade prereqs

//AWS permissions needed when running ccoctl during install (I think we can omit from upgrade, since they already have an appropriate AWS account if they are upgrading).

//Azure permissions needed when running ccoctl during install.

.Procedure

. Obtain the {product-title} release image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
----

. Obtain the CCO container image from the {product-title} release image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ CCO_IMAGE=$(oc adm release info --image-for='cloud-credential-operator' $RELEASE_IMAGE -a ~/.pull-secret)
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that the architecture of the `$RELEASE_IMAGE` matches the architecture of the environment in which you will use the `ccoctl` tool.
====

. Extract the `ccoctl` binary from the CCO container image within the {product-title} release image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image extract $CCO_IMAGE --file="/usr/bin/ccoctl" -a ~/.pull-secret
----

. Change the permissions to make `ccoctl` executable by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ chmod 775 ccoctl
----

.Verification

* To verify that `ccoctl` is ready to use, display the help file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ccoctl --help
----
+
.Output of `ccoctl --help`
