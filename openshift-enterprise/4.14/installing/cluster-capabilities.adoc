= Selecting cluster capabilities
You can select cluster capabilities by following one of the installation methods that include customizing your cluster, such as "Installing a cluster on AWS with customizations" or "Installing a cluster on GCP with customizations".

During a customized installation, you create an `install-config.yaml` file that contains the configuration parameters for your cluster.

[NOTE]
====
If you customize your cluster by enabling or disabling specific cluster capabilities, you are responsible for manually maintaining your `install-config.yaml` file. New {product-title} updates might declare new capability handles for existing components, or introduce new components altogether. Users who customize their `install-config.yaml` file should consider periodically updating their `install-config.yaml` file as {product-title} is updated.
====

You can use the following configuration parameters to select cluster capabilities:

[source,yaml]
----
capabilities:
  baselineCapabilitySet: v4.11 <1>
  additionalEnabledCapabilities: <2>
  - CSISnapshot
  - Console
  - Storage
----
<1> Defines a baseline set of capabilities to install. Valid values are `None`, `vCurrent` and `v4.x`. If you select `None`, all optional capabilities will be disabled. The default value is `vCurrent`, which enables all optional capabilities.
+
[NOTE]
====
`v4.x` refers to any value up to and including the current cluster version.
For example, valid values for a {product-title} 4.12 cluster are `v4.11` and `v4.12`.
====
<2> Defines a list of capabilities to explicitly enable. These will be enabled in addition to the capabilities specified in `baselineCapabilitySet`.
+
[NOTE]
====
In this example, the default capability is set to `v4.11`. The `additionalEnabledCapabilities` field enables additional capabilities over the default `v4.11` capability set.
====

:leveloffset!:

:_mod-docs-content-type: SNIPPET

[id="cluster-bare-metal-operator_{context}"]
= Cluster Baremetal Operator
= Bare-metal capability


[discrete]
== Purpose


The Cluster Baremetal Operator provides the features for the `baremetal` capability.


The Cluster Baremetal Operator (CBO) deploys all the components necessary to take a bare-metal server to a fully functioning worker node ready to run {product-title} compute nodes. The CBO ensures that the metal3 deployment, which consists of the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) and Ironic containers, runs on one of the control plane nodes within the {product-title} cluster. The CBO also listens for {product-title} updates to resources that it watches and takes appropriate action.

The bare-metal capability is required for deployments using installer-provisioned infrastructure. Disabling the bare-metal capability can result in unexpected problems with these deployments.

It is recommended that cluster administrators only disable the bare-metal capability during installations with user-provisioned infrastructure that do not have any `BareMetalHost` resources in the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the bare-metal capability is disabled, the cluster cannot provision or manage bare-metal nodes. Only disable the capability if there are no `BareMetalHost` resources in your deployment. The `baremetal` capability depends on the `MachineAPI` capability. If you enable the `baremetal` capability, you must also enable `MachineAPI`.

[discrete]
== Purpose

The `Build` capability enables the `Build` API. The `Build` API manages the lifecycle of `Build` and `BuildConfig` objects.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the `Build` capability is disabled, the cluster cannot use `Build` or `BuildConfig` resources. Disable the capability only if `Build` and `BuildConfig` resources are not required in the cluster.

[id="cluster-storage-operator_{context}"]
= Cluster Storage Operator
= Cluster storage capability


[discrete]
== Purpose


The Cluster Storage Operator provides the features for the `Storage` capability.


The Cluster Storage Operator sets {product-title} cluster-wide storage defaults. It ensures a default `storageclass` exists for {product-title} clusters. It also installs Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers which enable your cluster to use various storage backends.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the cluster storage capability is disabled, the cluster will not have a default `storageclass` or any CSI drivers. Users with administrator privileges can create a default `storageclass` and manually install CSI drivers if the cluster storage capability is disabled.
====


[discrete]
== Notes

* The storage class that the Operator creates can be made non-default by editing its annotation, but this storage class cannot be deleted as long as the Operator runs.

[id="marketplace-operator_{context}"]
= Marketplace Operator
= Marketplace capability


[discrete]
== Purpose


The Marketplace Operator provides the features for the `marketplace` capability.


The Marketplace Operator simplifies the process for bringing off-cluster Operators to your cluster by using a set of default Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) catalogs on the cluster. When the Marketplace Operator is installed, it creates the `openshift-marketplace` namespace. OLM ensures catalog sources installed in the `openshift-marketplace` namespace are available for all namespaces on the cluster.

If you disable the `marketplace` capability, the Marketplace Operator does not create the `openshift-marketplace` namespace. Catalog sources can still be configured and managed on the cluster manually, but OLM depends on the `openshift-marketplace` namespace in order to make catalogs available to all namespaces on the cluster. Users with elevated permissions to create namespaces prefixed with `openshift-`, such as system or cluster administrators, can manually create the `openshift-marketplace` namespace.

If you enable the `marketplace` capability, you can enable and disable individual catalogs by configuring the Marketplace Operator.

[discrete]
== Purpose

The Node Tuning Operator provides features for the `NodeTuning` capability.

The Node Tuning Operator helps you manage node-level tuning by orchestrating the TuneD daemon and achieves low latency performance by using the Performance Profile controller. The majority of high-performance applications require some level of kernel tuning. The Node Tuning Operator provides a unified management interface to users of node-level sysctls and more flexibility to add custom tuning specified by user needs.

If you disable the NodeTuning capability, some default tuning settings will not be applied to the control-plane nodes. This might limit the scalability and performance of large clusters with over 900 nodes or 900 routes.

[id="cluster-samples-operator_{context}"]
= Cluster Samples Operator
= OpenShift samples capability


[discrete]
== Purpose

The Cluster Samples Operator provides the features for the `openshift-samples` capability.

The Cluster Samples Operator manages the sample image streams and templates stored in the `openshift` namespace.

On initial start up, the Operator creates the default samples configuration resource to initiate the creation of the image streams and templates. The configuration object is a cluster scoped object with the key `cluster` and type `configs.samples`.

The image streams are the {op-system-first}-based {product-title} image streams pointing to images on `registry.redhat.io`. Similarly, the templates are those categorized as {product-title} templates.

If you disable the samples capability, users cannot access the image streams, samples, and templates it provides. Depending on your deployment, you might want to disable this component if you do not need it.

[id="cluster-image-registry-operator_{context}"]
= Cluster Image Registry Operator
= Cluster Image Registry capability

[discrete]
== Purpose

The Cluster Image Registry Operator provides features for the `ImageRegistry` capability.

The Cluster Image Registry Operator manages a singleton instance of the {product-registry}. It manages all configuration of the registry, including creating storage.

On initial start up, the Operator creates a default `image-registry` resource instance based on the configuration detected in the cluster. This indicates what cloud storage type to use based on the cloud provider.

If insufficient information is available to define a complete `image-registry` resource, then an incomplete resource is defined and the Operator updates the resource status with information about what is missing.

The Cluster Image Registry Operator runs in the `openshift-image-registry` namespace and it also manages the registry instance in that location. All configuration and workload resources for the registry reside in that namespace.

If you disable the `ImageRegistry` capability, you can reduce the overall resource footprint of {product-title} in Telco environments. Depending on your deployment, you can disable this component if you do not need it.
