toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
Microsoft Azure into a government region. To configure the government region,
you modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before you install the
cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-account.adoc#installing-azure-account[configured an Azure account] to host the cluster and determined the tested and validated government region to deploy the cluster to.
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* If the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the `kube-system` namespace, you can xref:../../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-customizations.adoc#manually-create-iam_installing-azure-customizations[manually create and maintain long-term credentials].
* If you use customer-managed encryption keys, you xref:../../installing/installing_azure/enabling-user-managed-encryption-azure.adoc#enabling-user-managed-encryption-azure[prepared your Azure environment for encryption].

[id="installation-azure-about-government-region_{context}"]
= Azure government regions

{product-title} supports deploying a cluster to
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-welcome[Microsoft Azure Government (MAG)]
regions. MAG is specifically designed for US government agencies at the federal,
state, and local level, as well as contractors, educational institutions, and
other US customers that must run sensitive workloads on Azure. MAG is composed
of government-only data center regions, all granted an
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/offering-dod-disa-l2-l4-l5?view=o365-worldwide#dod-impact-level-5-provisional-authorization[Impact Level 5 Provisional Authorization].

Installing to a MAG region requires manually configuring the Azure Government
dedicated cloud instance and region in the `install-config.yaml` file. You must
also update your service principal to reference the appropriate government
environment.

[NOTE]
====
The Azure government region cannot be selected using the guided terminal prompts
from the installation program. You must define the region manually in the
`install-config.yaml` file. Remember to also set the dedicated cloud instance,
like `AzureUSGovernmentCloud`, based on the region specified.

[id="private-clusters-default_{context}"]
= Private clusters






You can deploy a private {product-title} cluster that does not expose external endpoints. Private clusters are accessible from only an internal network and are not visible to the internet.


By default, {product-title} is provisioned to use publicly-accessible DNS and endpoints. A private cluster sets the DNS, Ingress Controller, and API server to private when you deploy your cluster. This means that the cluster resources are only accessible from your internal network and are not visible to the internet.

// Text snippet included in the following modules:
//
// * modules/private-clusters-default.adoc
// * modules/private-clusters-about.adoc
// * modules/private-clusters-about-aws.adoc

:_mod-docs-content-type: SNIPPET

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the cluster has any public subnets, load balancer services created by administrators might be publicly accessible. To ensure cluster security, verify that these services are explicitly annotated as private.
====

To deploy a private cluster, you must:

* Use existing networking that meets your requirements. Your cluster resources might be shared between other clusters on the network.
* Deploy from a machine that has access to:
** The API services for the cloud to which you provision.
** The hosts on the network that you provision.
** The internet to obtain installation media.

You can use any machine that meets these access requirements and follows your company's guidelines. For example, this machine can be a bastion host on your cloud network or a machine that has access to the network through a VPN.

[id="private-clusters-about-azure_{context}"]
= Private clusters in Azure

To create a private cluster on Microsoft Azure, you must provide an existing private VNet and subnets to host the cluster. The installation program must also be able to resolve the DNS records that the cluster requires. The installation program configures the Ingress Operator and API server for only internal traffic.

Depending how your network connects to the private VNET, you might need to use a DNS forwarder to resolve the cluster's private DNS records. The cluster's machines use `168.63.129.16` internally for DNS resolution. For more information, see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-overview[What is Azure Private DNS?] and link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/what-is-ip-address-168-63-129-16[What is IP address 168.63.129.16?] in the Azure documentation.

The cluster still requires access to internet to access the Azure APIs.

The following items are not required or created when you install a private cluster:

* A `BaseDomainResourceGroup`, since the cluster does not create public records
* Public IP addresses
* Public DNS records
* Public endpoints

 The cluster is configured so that the Operators do not create public records for the cluster and all cluster machines are placed in the private subnets that you specify.

[id="private-clusters-limitations-azure_{context}"]
== Limitations

Private clusters on Azure are subject to only the limitations that are associated with the use of an existing VNet.


////
Is this also valid in Azure?

The ability to add public functionality to a private cluster is limited.

* You cannot make the Kubernetes API endpoints public after installation without taking additional actions, including creating public subnets in the VNet for each availability zone in use, creating a public load balancer, and configuring the control plane security groups to allow traffic from the internet on 6443 (Kubernetes API port).

[id="installation-azure-user-defined-routing_{context}"]
= User-defined outbound routing

In {product-title}, you can choose your own outbound routing for a cluster to connect to the internet. This allows you to skip the creation of public IP addresses and the public load balancer.

You can configure user-defined routing by modifying parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before installing your cluster. A pre-existing VNet is required to use outbound routing when installing a cluster; the installation program is not responsible for configuring this.

When configuring a cluster to use user-defined routing, the installation program does not create the following resources:

* Outbound rules for access to the internet.
* Public IPs for the public load balancer.
* Kubernetes Service object to add the cluster machines to the public load balancer for outbound requests.

You must ensure the following items are available before setting user-defined
routing:

* Egress to the internet is possible to pull container images, unless using an
{product-registry} mirror.
* The cluster can access Azure APIs.
* Various allowlist endpoints are configured. You can reference these endpoints in the _Configuring your firewall_ section.

There are several pre-existing networking setups that are supported for internet access using user-defined routing.

[id="installation-about-custom-azure-vnet_{context}"]
= About reusing a VNet for your {product-title} cluster

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can deploy a cluster into an existing Azure Virtual Network (VNet) in Microsoft Azure. If you do, you must also use existing subnets within the VNet and routing rules.

By deploying {product-title} into an existing Azure VNet, you might be able to avoid service limit constraints in new accounts or more easily abide by the operational constraints that your company's guidelines set. This is a good option to use if you cannot obtain the infrastructure creation permissions that are required to create the VNet.

[id="installation-about-custom-azure-vnet-requirements_{context}"]
== Requirements for using your VNet

When you deploy a cluster by using an existing VNet, you must perform additional network configuration before you install the cluster. In installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, the installer usually creates the following components, but it does not create them when you install into an existing VNet:

* Subnets
* Route tables
* VNets
* Network Security Groups

// Text snippet included in the following modules:
//
// * modules/installation-custom-aws-vpc.adoc
// * modules/installation-about-custom-azure-vnet.adoc
// * modules/installation-custom-gcp-vpc.adoc
// * modules/installation-custom-alibaba-vpc.adoc
// * modules/installation-ibm-power-vs.adoc

:_mod-docs-content-type: SNIPPET

[NOTE]
====
The installation program requires that you use the cloud-provided DNS server. Using a custom DNS server is not supported and causes the installation to fail.
====

If you use a custom VNet, you must correctly configure it and its subnets for the installation program and the cluster to use. The installation program cannot subdivide network ranges for the cluster to use, set route tables for the subnets, or set VNet options like DHCP, so you must do so before you install the cluster.

The cluster must be able to access the resource group that contains the existing VNet and subnets. While all of the resources that the cluster creates are placed in a separate resource group that it creates, some network resources are used from a separate group. Some cluster Operators must be able to access resources in both resource groups. For example, the Machine API controller attaches NICS for the virtual machines that it creates to subnets from the networking resource group.

Your VNet must meet the following characteristics:

* The VNet's CIDR block must contain the `Networking.MachineCIDR` range, which is the IP address pool for cluster machines.
* The VNet and its subnets must belong to the same resource group, and the subnets must be configured to use Azure-assigned DHCP IP addresses instead of static IP addresses.

You must provide two subnets within your VNet, one for the control plane machines and one for the compute machines. Because Azure distributes machines in different availability zones within the region that you specify, your cluster will have high availability by default.

[NOTE]
====
By default, if you specify availability zones in the `install-config.yaml` file, the installation program distributes the control plane machines and the compute machines across link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/availability-zones/[these availability zones]
within link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions[a region]. To ensure high availability for your cluster, select a region with at least three availability zones. If your region contains fewer than three availability zones, the installation program places more than one control plane machine in the available zones.
====

To ensure that the subnets that you provide are suitable, the installation program confirms the following data:

* All the specified subnets exist.
* There are two private subnets, one for the control plane machines and one for the compute machines.
* The subnet CIDRs belong to the machine CIDR that you specified. Machines are not provisioned in availability zones that you do not provide private subnets for.
If required, the installation program creates public load balancers that manage the control plane and worker nodes, and Azure allocates a public IP address to them.

[NOTE]
====
If you destroy a cluster that uses an existing VNet, the VNet is not deleted.
====

[id="installation-about-custom-azure-vnet-nsg-requirements_{context}"]
=== Network security group requirements

The network security groups for the subnets that host the compute and control plane machines require specific access to ensure that the cluster communication is correct. You must create rules to allow access to the required cluster communication ports.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The network security group rules must be in place before you install the cluster. If you attempt to install a cluster without the required access, the installation program cannot reach the Azure APIs, and installation fails.

:_mod-docs-content-type: SNIPPET

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, there is no supported way to block or restrict the machine config server endpoint. The machine config server must be exposed to the network so that newly-provisioned machines, which have no existing configuration or state, are able to fetch their configuration. In this model, the root of trust is the certificate signing requests (CSR) endpoint, which is where the kubelet sends its certificate signing request for approval to join the cluster. Because of this, machine configs should not be used to distribute sensitive information, such as secrets and certificates.

To ensure that the machine config server endpoints, ports 22623 and 22624, are secured in bare metal scenarios, customers must configure proper network policies.
====

Because cluster components do not modify the user-provided network security groups, which the Kubernetes controllers update, a pseudo-network security group is created for the Kubernetes controller to modify without impacting the rest of the environment.

[id="installation-about-custom-azure-permissions_{context}"]
== Division of permissions

Starting with {product-title} 4.3, you do not need all of the permissions that are required for an installation program-provisioned infrastructure cluster to deploy a cluster. This change mimics the division of permissions that you might have at your company: some individuals can create different resources in your clouds than others. For example, you might be able to create application-specific items, like instances, storage, and load balancers, but not networking-related components such as VNets, subnet, or ingress rules.

The Azure credentials that you use when you create your cluster do not need the networking permissions that are required to make VNets and core networking components within the VNet, such as subnets, routing tables, internet gateways, NAT, and VPN. You still need permission to make the application resources that the machines within the cluster require, such as load balancers, security groups, storage accounts, and nodes.

[id="installation-about-custom-azure-vnet-isolation_{context}"]
== Isolation between clusters

Because the cluster is unable to modify network security groups in an existing subnet, there is no way to isolate clusters from each other on the VNet.
////
These are some of the details from the AWS version, and if any of them are relevant to Azure, they can be included.
If you deploy {product-title} to an existing network, the isolation of cluster services is reduced in the following ways:

* You can install multiple {product-title} clusters in the same VNet.
* ICMP ingress is allowed to entire network.
* TCP 22 ingress (SSH) is allowed to the entire network.
* Control plane TCP 6443 ingress (Kubernetes API) is allowed to the entire network.
* Control plane TCP 22623 ingress (MCS) is allowed to the entire network.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="ssh-agent-using_{context}"]
= Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

During an {product-title} installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the {op-system-first} nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` list for the `core` user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the {op-system} nodes as the user `core`. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The `./openshift-install gather` command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
====

[NOTE]
====
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific
approaches such as
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[AWS key pairs].
====


.Procedure

. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name> <1>
----
<1> Specify the path and file name, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your `~/.ssh` directory.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you plan to install an {product-title} cluster that uses the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures, do not create a key that uses the `ed25519` algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the `rsa` or `ecdsa` algorithm.
====

. View the public SSH key:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
----
+
For example, run the following to view the `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` public key:
+
[source,termanal]
----
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
----

. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the `./openshift-install gather` command.
+
[NOTE]
====
On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_dsa` are managed automatically.
====
+
.. If the `ssh-agent` process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Agent pid 31874
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.
====

. Add your SSH private key to the `ssh-agent`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh-add <path>/<file_name> <1>
----
<1> Specify the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
----

.Next steps

* When you install {product-title}, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.

[id="installation-obtaining-installer_{context}"]
= Obtaining the installation program

Before you install {product-title}, download the installation file on
 your provisioning machine.
 the host you are using for installation.
//mpytlak: Added "private" in the context of a review for the IBM Cloud VPC private work. In an effort to keep updates to other platforms separate, I will open a doc story for each platform that supports a private install.

.Prerequisites

* You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with 500 MB of local disk space.

.Procedure

. Access the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install[Infrastructure Provider] page on the {cluster-manager} site. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.
. Select your infrastructure provider.
. Navigate to the page for your installation type, download the installation program that corresponds with your host operating system and architecture, and place the file in the directory where you will store the installation configuration files.

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both files are required to delete the cluster.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the {product-title} uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider.
====

. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux
operating system, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
----

. Download your installation {cluster-manager-url-pull}. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for {product-title} components.

[id="installation-initializing-manual_{context}"]
= Manually creating the installation configuration file

When installing {product-title} on Microsoft Azure into a government region, you
must manually generate your installation configuration file.

.Prerequisites

* You have an SSH public key on your local machine to provide to the installation program. The key will be used for SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes for debugging and disaster recovery.
* You have obtained the {product-title} installation program and the pull secret for your
cluster.

.Procedure

. Create an installation directory to store your required installation assets in:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir <installation_directory>
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must create a directory. Some installation assets, like bootstrap X.509
certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an
installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another
cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file
names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution
when copying installation files from an earlier {product-title} version.
====

. Customize the sample `install-config.yaml` file template that is provided and save
it in the `<installation_directory>`.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must name this configuration file `install-config.yaml`.
====

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
** The `ImageContentSourcePolicy` file is generated as an output of `oc mirror` after the mirroring process is finished.
** The `oc mirror` command generates an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` file which contains the YAML needed to define `ImageContentSourcePolicy`.
Copy the text from this file and paste it into your `install-config.yaml` file.
** You must run the 'oc mirror' command twice. The first time you run the `oc mirror` command, you get a full `ImageContentSourcePolicy` file. The second time you run the `oc mirror` command, you only get the difference between the first and second run.
Because of this behavior, you must always keep a backup of these files in case you need to merge them into one complete `ImageContentSourcePolicy` file. Keeping a backup of these two output files ensures that you have a complete `ImageContentSourcePolicy` file.
====




. Back up the `install-config.yaml` file so that you can use it to install
multiple clusters.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `install-config.yaml` file is consumed during the next step of the
installation process. You must back it up now.

1. One vCPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs.
2. {product-title} and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and faster storage is recommended, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes which require a 10 ms p99 fsync duration. Note that on many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to over-allocate storage volume to obtain sufficient performance.
3. As with all user-provisioned installations, if you choose to use {op-system-base} compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks. Use of {op-system-base} 7 compute machines is deprecated and has been removed in {product-title} 4.10 and later.
--

[IMPORTANT]
====
You are required to use Azure virtual machines that have the `premiumIO` parameter set to `true`.
====

If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in {product-title}.

You can enable confidential VMs when installing your cluster. You can enable confidential VMs for compute nodes, control plane nodes, or all nodes.

:FeatureName: Using confidential VMs

// When including this file, ensure that {FeatureName} is set immediately before
// the include. Otherwise it will result in an incorrect replacement.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[subs="attributes+"]
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].

:!FeatureName:

//commenting out the second encryption option until https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18379 is resolved
////
Confidential VMs can operate in two modes:

* Only encrypting the virtual machine guest state storage, which contains the security state of the virtual machine
* Encrypting the virtual machine guest state storage and the operating system storage

If you encrypt the operating system storage, you can use a platform-managed encryption key or a key you manage.
////

You can use confidential VMs with the following VM sizes:

* DCasv5-series
* DCadsv5-series
* ECasv5-series
* ECadsv5-series


[IMPORTANT]
====
Confidential VMs are currently not supported on 64-bit ARM architectures.
====

----
<1> Required.
<2> If you do not provide these parameters and values, the installation program provides the default value.
<3> The `controlPlane` section is a single mapping, but the `compute` section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the `compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`, and the first line of the `controlPlane` section must not. Only one control plane pool is used.
<4> Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or `hyperthreading`. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to `Disabled`. If you disable simultaneous multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster machines.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance. Use larger virtual machine types, such as `Standard_D8s_v3`, for your machines if you disable simultaneous multithreading.
====
<5> You can specify the size of the disk to use in GB. Minimum recommendation for control plane nodes is 1024 GB.
//To configure faster storage for etcd, especially for larger clusters, set the
//storage type as `io1` and set `iops` to `2000`.
<6> Specify a list of zones to deploy your machines to. For high availability, specify at least two zones.
<7> The cluster network plugin to install. The supported values are `OVNKubernetes` and `OpenShiftSDN`. The default value is `OVNKubernetes`.
<8> Optional: A custom {op-system-first} image that should be used to boot control plane and compute machines. The `publisher`, `offer`, `sku`, and `version` parameters under `platform.azure.defaultMachinePlatform.osImage` apply to both control plane and compute machines. If the parameters under `controlPlane.platform.azure.osImage` or `compute.platform.azure.osImage` are set, they override the `platform.azure.defaultMachinePlatform.osImage` parameters.
<9> Specify the name of the resource group that contains the DNS zone for your base domain.
<10> Specify the name of an already existing resource group to install your cluster to. If undefined, a new resource group is created for the cluster.
<11> If you use an existing VNet, specify the name of the resource group that contains it.
<12> If you use an existing VNet, specify its name.
<13> If you use an existing VNet, specify the name of the subnet to host the control plane machines.
<14> If you use an existing VNet, specify the name of the subnet to host the compute machines.
<15> You can customize your own outbound routing. Configuring user-defined routing prevents exposing external endpoints in your cluster. User-defined routing for egress requires deploying your cluster to an existing VNet.
<16> Specify the name of the Azure cloud environment to deploy your cluster to. Set `AzureUSGovernmentCloud` to deploy to a Microsoft Azure Government (MAG) region. The default value is `AzurePublicCloud`.
<17> Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the {op-system-first} machines that {product-title} runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with {op-system} instead.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a {op-system-base-full} computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on RHEL, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/assembly_installing-the-system-in-fips-mode_security-hardening[Installing the system in FIPS mode]. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
====
<18> You can optionally provide the `sshKey` value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.
====
<19> How to publish the user-facing endpoints of your cluster. Set `publish` to `Internal` to deploy a private cluster, which cannot be accessed from the internet. The default value is `External`.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="installation-configure-proxy_{context}"]
= Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have
an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new {product-title}
cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the
`install-config.yaml` file.



.Prerequisites

* You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.
// TODO: xref (../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall)
* You reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the `Proxy` object's `spec.noProxy` field to bypass the proxy if necessary.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field is populated with the values of the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr`, `networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr`, and `networking.serviceNetwork[]` fields from your installation configuration.

For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and {rh-openstack-first}, the `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`).
====

.Procedure

. Edit your `install-config.yaml` file and add the proxy settings. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> <1>
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> <2>
  noProxy: example.com <3>
additionalTrustBundle: | <4>
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle> <5>
----
<1> A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The
URL scheme must be `http`.
<2> A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.
<3> A comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with `.` to match subdomains only. For example, `.y.com` matches `x.y.com`, but not `y.com`. Use `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations.
<4> If provided, the installation program generates a config map that is named `user-ca-bundle` in
the `openshift-config` namespace that contains one or more additional CA
certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections. The Cluster Network
Operator then creates a `trusted-ca-bundle` config map that merges these contents
with the {op-system-first} trust bundle, and this config map is referenced in the `trustedCA` field of the `Proxy` object. The `additionalTrustBundle` field is required unless
the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the {op-system} trust
bundle.
<5> Optional: The policy to determine the configuration of the `Proxy` object to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map in the `trustedCA` field. The allowed values are `Proxyonly` and `Always`. Use `Proxyonly` to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map only when `http/https` proxy is configured. Use `Always` to always reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map. The default value is `Proxyonly`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The installation program does not support the proxy `readinessEndpoints` field.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
If the installer times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the `wait-for` command of the installer. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
----
====

. Save the file and reference it when installing {product-title}.

The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named `cluster` that uses the proxy
settings in the provided `install-config.yaml` file. If no proxy settings are
provided, a `cluster` `Proxy` object is still created, but it will have a nil
`spec`.

[NOTE]
====
Only the `Proxy` object named `cluster` is supported, and no additional
proxies can be created.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="installation-launching-installer_{context}"]
= Deploying the cluster

You can install {product-title} on a compatible cloud platform.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can run the `create cluster` command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.

* You have the {product-title} installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
* You have an Azure subscription ID and tenant ID.
* If you are installing the cluster using a service principal, you have its application ID and password.
* If you are installing the cluster using a system-assigned managed identity, you have enabled it on the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.
* If you are installing the cluster using a user-assigned managed identity, you have met these prerequisites:
** You have its client ID.
** You have assigned it to the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.

.Procedure

. Optional: If you have run the installation program on this computer before, and want to use an alternative service principal or managed identity, go to the `~/.azure/` directory and delete the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file.
+
Deleting this file prevents the installation program from automatically reusing subscription and authentication values from a previous installation.
. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and initialize the cluster deployment:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \ <1>
    --log-level=info <2>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the
location of your customized `./install-config.yaml` file.
<2> To view different installation details, specify `warn`, `debug`, or
`error` instead of `info`.

+
If the installation program cannot locate the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file from a previous installation, you are prompted for Azure subscription and authentication values.
. Enter the following Azure parameter values for your subscription:
** *azure subscription id*: Enter the subscription ID to use for the cluster.
** *azure tenant id*: Enter the tenant ID.
. Depending on the Azure identity you are using to deploy the cluster, do one of the following when prompted for the *azure service principal client id*:
** If you are using a service principal, enter its application ID.
** If you are using a system-assigned managed identity, leave this value blank.
** If you are using a user-assigned managed identity, specify its client ID.
. Depending on the Azure identity you are using to deploy the cluster, do one of the following when prompted for the *azure service principal client secret*:
** If you are using a service principal, enter its password.
** If you are using a system-assigned managed identity, leave this value blank.
** If you are using a user-assigned managed identity,leave this value blank.

If previously not detected, the installation program creates an `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file and stores this file in the `~/.azure/` directory on your computer. This ensures that the installation program can load the profile when it is creating an {product-title} cluster on the target platform.




.Verification
When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

* The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the `kubeadmin` user.
* Credential information also outputs to `<installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
====

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for _Recovering from expired control plane certificates_ for more information.

* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
