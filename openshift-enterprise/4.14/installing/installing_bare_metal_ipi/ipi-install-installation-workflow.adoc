= Checking NTP server synchronization

The {product-title} installation program installs the `chrony` Network Time Protocol (NTP) service on the cluster nodes. To complete installation, each node must have access to an NTP time server. You can verify NTP server synchronization by using the `chrony` service.

For disconnected clusters, you must configure the NTP servers on the control plane nodes. For more information see the _Additional resources_ section.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the `chrony` package on the target node.

.Procedure

. Log in to the node by using the `ssh` command.

. View the NTP servers available to the node by running the following command:

[id="ipi-install-establishing-communication-between-subnets_{context}"]
= Establishing communication between subnets

In a typical {product-title} cluster setup, all nodes, including the control plane and worker nodes, reside in the same network. However, for edge computing scenarios, it can be beneficial to locate worker nodes closer to the edge. This often involves using different network segments or subnets for the remote worker nodes than the subnet used by the control plane and local worker nodes. Such a setup can reduce latency for the edge and allow for enhanced scalability. However, the network must be configured properly before installing {product-title} to ensure that the edge subnets containing the remote worker nodes can reach the subnet containing the control plane nodes and receive traffic from the control plane too.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All control plane nodes must run in the same subnet. When using more than one subnet, you can also configure the Ingress VIP to run on the control plane nodes by using a manifest. See "Configuring network components to run on the control plane" for details.

Deploying a cluster with multiple subnets requires using virtual media.
====

This procedure details the network configuration required to allow the remote worker nodes in the second subnet to communicate effectively with the control plane nodes in the first subnet and to allow the control plane nodes in the first subnet to communicate effectively with the remote worker nodes in the second subnet.

In this procedure, the cluster spans two subnets:

- The first subnet (`10.0.0.0`) contains the control plane and local worker nodes.
- The second subnet (`192.168.0.0`) contains the edge worker nodes.

.Procedure

. Configure the first subnet to communicate with the second subnet:

.. Log in as `root` to a control plane node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo su -
----

.. Get the name of the network interface:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# nmcli dev status
----

.. Add a route to the second subnet (`192.168.0.0`) via the gateway:
s+
[source,terminal]
----
# nmcli connection modify <interface_name> +ipv4.routes "192.168.0.0/24 via <gateway>"
----
+
Replace `<interface_name>` with the interface name. Replace `<gateway>` with the IP address of the actual gateway.
+
.Example
+
[source,terminal]
----
# nmcli connection modify eth0 +ipv4.routes "192.168.0.0/24 via 192.168.0.1"
----

.. Apply the changes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# nmcli connection up <interface_name>
----
+
Replace `<interface_name>` with the interface name.

.. Verify the routing table to ensure the route has been added successfully:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# ip route
----

.. Repeat the previous steps for each control plane node in the first subnet.
+
[NOTE]
====
Adjust the commands to match your actual interface names and gateway.
====

. Configure the second subnet to communicate with the first subnet:

.. Log in as `root` to a remote worker node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo su -

----
# nmcli connection modify <interface_name> +ipv4.routes "10.0.0.0/24 via <gateway>"
----
+
Replace `<interface_name>` with the interface name. Replace `<gateway>` with the IP address of the actual gateway.

# ip route
----

.. Repeat the previous steps for each worker node in the second subnet.
+
[NOTE]
====
Adjust the commands to match your actual interface names and gateway.
====

. Once you have configured the networks, test the connectivity to ensure the remote worker nodes can reach the control plane nodes and the control plane nodes can reach the remote worker nodes.

.. From the control plane nodes in the first subnet, ping a remote worker node in the second subnet:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ping <remote_worker_node_ip_address>
----
+
If the ping is successful, it means the control plane nodes in the first subnet can reach the remote worker nodes in the second subnet. If you don't receive a response, review the network configurations and repeat the procedure for the node.

.. From the remote worker nodes in the second subnet, ping a control plane node in the first subnet:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ping <control_plane_node_ip_address>
----
+
If the ping is successful, it means the remote worker nodes in the second subnet can reach the control plane in the first subnet. If you don't receive a response, review the network configurations and repeat the procedure for the node.

= Optional: Creating an {op-system} images cache

To employ image caching, you must download the {op-system-first} image used by the bootstrap VM to provision the cluster nodes. Image caching is optional, but it is especially useful when running the installation program on a network with limited bandwidth.

[NOTE]
====
The installation program no longer needs the `clusterOSImage` {op-system} image because the correct image is in the release payload.
====

If you are running the installation program on a network with limited bandwidth and the {op-system} images download takes more than 15 to 20 minutes, the installation program will timeout. Caching images on a web server will help in such scenarios.

[WARNING]
====
If you enable TLS for the HTTPD server, you must confirm the root certificate is signed by an authority trusted by the client and verify the trusted certificate chain between your {product-title} hub and spoke clusters and the HTTPD server. Using a server configured with an untrusted certificate prevents the images from being downloaded to the image creation service. Using untrusted HTTPS servers is not supported.
====

Install a container that contains the images.

.Procedure

. Install `podman`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf install -y podman
----

. Open firewall port `8080` to be used for {op-system} image caching:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --zone=public --permanent
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
----

. Create a directory to store the `bootstraposimage`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir /home/kni/rhcos_image_cache
----

. Set the appropriate SELinux context for the newly created directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t "/home/kni/rhcos_image_cache(/.*)?"
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo restorecon -Rv /home/kni/rhcos_image_cache/
----

. Get the URI for the {op-system} image that the installation program will deploy on the bootstrap VM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export RHCOS_QEMU_URI=$(/usr/local/bin/openshift-baremetal-install coreos print-stream-json | jq -r --arg ARCH "$(arch)" '.architectures[$ARCH].artifacts.qemu.formats["qcow2.gz"].disk.location')
----

. Get the name of the image that the installation program will deploy on the bootstrap VM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export RHCOS_QEMU_NAME=${RHCOS_QEMU_URI##*/}
----

. Get the SHA hash for the {op-system} image that will be deployed on the bootstrap VM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export RHCOS_QEMU_UNCOMPRESSED_SHA256=$(/usr/local/bin/openshift-baremetal-install coreos print-stream-json | jq -r --arg ARCH "$(arch)" '.architectures[$ARCH].artifacts.qemu.formats["qcow2.gz"].disk["uncompressed-sha256"]')
----

. Download the image and place it in the `/home/kni/rhcos_image_cache` directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -L ${RHCOS_QEMU_URI} -o /home/kni/rhcos_image_cache/${RHCOS_QEMU_NAME}
----

. Confirm SELinux type is of `httpd_sys_content_t` for the new file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ls -Z /home/kni/rhcos_image_cache
----

. Create the pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run -d --name rhcos_image_cache \ <1>
-v /home/kni/rhcos_image_cache:/var/www/html \
-p 8080:8080/tcp \
quay.io/centos7/httpd-24-centos7:latest
----
+
<1> Creates a caching webserver with the name `rhcos_image_cache`. This pod serves the `bootstrapOSImage` image in the `install-config.yaml` file for deployment.

. Generate the `bootstrapOSImage` configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export BAREMETAL_IP=$(ip addr show dev baremetal | awk '/inet /{print $2}' | cut -d"/" -f1)
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export BOOTSTRAP_OS_IMAGE="http://${BAREMETAL_IP}:8080/${RHCOS_QEMU_NAME}?sha256=${RHCOS_QEMU_UNCOMPRESSED_SHA256}"
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo "    bootstrapOSImage=${BOOTSTRAP_OS_IMAGE}"
----

. Add the required configuration to the `install-config.yaml` file under `platform.baremetal`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
platform:
  baremetal:
    bootstrapOSImage: <bootstrap_os_image>  <1>
----
<1> Replace `<bootstrap_os_image>` with the value of `$BOOTSTRAP_OS_IMAGE`.

<1> Scale the worker machines based on the number of worker nodes that are part of the {product-title} cluster. Valid options for the `replicas` value are `0` and integers greater than or equal to `2`. Set the number of replicas to `0` to deploy a three-node cluster, which contains only three control plane machines. A three-node cluster is a smaller, more resource-efficient cluster that can be used for testing, development, and production. You cannot install the cluster with only one worker.
<2> When deploying a cluster with static IP addresses, you must set the `bootstrapExternalStaticIP` configuration setting to specify the static IP address of the bootstrap VM when there is no DHCP server on the bare-metal network.
<3> When deploying a cluster with static IP addresses, you must set the `bootstrapExternalStaticGateway` configuration setting to specify the gateway IP address for the bootstrap VM when there is no DHCP server on the bare-metal network.
<4> See the BMC addressing sections for more options.
<5> To set the path to the installation disk drive, enter the kernel name of the disk. For example, `/dev/sda`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the disk discovery order is not guaranteed, the kernel name of the disk can change across booting options for machines with multiple disks. For instance, `/dev/sda` becomes `/dev/sdb` and vice versa.
To avoid this issue, you must use persistent disk attributes, such as the disk World Wide Name (WWN). To use the disk WWN, replace the `deviceName` parameter with the `wwnWithExtension` parameter. Depending on the parameter that you use, enter the disk name, for example, `/dev/sda` or the disk WWN, for example, `"0x64cd98f04fde100024684cf3034da5c2"`. Ensure that you enter the disk WWN value within quotes so that it is used as a string value and not a hexadecimal value.

Failure to meet these requirements for the `rootDeviceHints` parameter might result in the following error:

[source,text]
----
ironic-inspector inspection failed: No disks satisfied root device hints

[NOTE]
====
Before {product-title} 4.12, the cluster installation program only accepted an IPv4 address or and IPv6 address for the `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` configuration settings. In {product-title} 4.12 and later, these configuration settings are deprecated. Instead, use a list format in the `apiVIPs` and `ingressVIPs` configuration settings to specify IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses or both IP address formats.

= BMC addressing

Most vendors support Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) addressing with the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI). IPMI does not encrypt communications. It is suitable for use within a data center over a secured or dedicated management network. Check with your vendor to see if they support Redfish network boot. Redfish delivers simple and secure management for converged, hybrid IT and the Software Defined Data Center (SDDC). Redfish is human readable and machine capable, and leverages common internet and web services standards to expose information directly to the modern tool chain. If your hardware does not support Redfish network boot, use IPMI.

[discrete]
== IPMI

Hosts using IPMI use the `ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>:<port>` address format, which defaults to port `623` if not specified. The following example demonstrates an IPMI configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `provisioning` network is required when PXE booting using IPMI for BMC addressing. It is not possible to PXE boot hosts without a `provisioning` network. If you deploy without a `provisioning` network, you must use a virtual media BMC addressing option such as `redfish-virtualmedia` or `idrac-virtualmedia`. See "Redfish virtual media for HPE iLO" in the "BMC addressing for HPE iLO" section or "Redfish virtual media for Dell iDRAC" in the "BMC addressing for Dell iDRAC" section for additional details.
====

[discrete]
== Redfish network boot

To enable Redfish, use `redfish://` or `redfish+http://` to disable TLS. The installer requires both the hostname or the IP address and the path to the system ID. The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
----

While it is recommended to have a certificate of authority for the out-of-band management addresses, you must include `disableCertificateVerification: True` in the `bmc` configuration if using self-signed certificates. The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration using the `disableCertificateVerification: True` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use `idrac-virtualmedia` as the protocol for Redfish virtual media. `redfish-virtualmedia` will not work on Dell hardware. Dell's `idrac-virtualmedia` uses the Redfish standard with Dell's OEM extensions.

== Redfish virtual media for Dell iDRAC

For Redfish virtual media on Dell servers, use `idrac-virtualmedia://` in the `address` setting. Using `redfish-virtualmedia://` will not work.

[NOTE]
====
Use `idrac-virtualmedia://` as the protocol for Redfish virtual media. Using `redfish-virtualmedia://` will not work on Dell hardware, because the `idrac-virtualmedia://` protocol corresponds to the `idrac` hardware type and the Redfish protocol in Ironic. Dell's `idrac-virtualmedia://` protocol uses the Redfish standard with Dell's OEM extensions. Ironic also supports the `idrac` type with the WSMAN protocol. Therefore, you must specify `idrac-virtualmedia://` to avoid unexpected behavior when electing to use Redfish with virtual media on Dell hardware.
====

The following example demonstrates using iDRAC virtual media within the  `install-config.yaml` file.

====
There is a known issue on Dell iDRAC 9 with firmware version `04.40.00.00` and all releases up to including the `5.xx` series for installer-provisioned installations on bare metal deployments. The virtual console plugin defaults to eHTML5, an enhanced version of HTML5, which causes problems with the *InsertVirtualMedia* workflow. Set the plugin to use HTML5 to avoid this issue. The menu path is *Configuration* -> *Virtual console* -> *Plug-in Type* -> *HTML5* .

Ensure the {product-title} cluster nodes have *AutoAttach* enabled through the iDRAC console. The menu path is: *Configuration* -> *Virtual Media* -> *Attach Mode* -> *AutoAttach* .

| Subfield | Description

| `deviceName` | A string containing a Linux device name such as `/dev/vda` or `/dev/disk/by-path/`. It is recommended to use the `/dev/disk/by-path/<device_path>` link to the storage location. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

| `hctl` | A string containing a SCSI bus address like `0:0:0:0`. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

| `model` | A string containing a vendor-specific device identifier. The hint can be a substring of the actual value.

| `vendor` | A string containing the name of the vendor or manufacturer of the device. The hint can be a sub-string of the actual value.

| `serialNumber` | A string containing the device serial number. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

| `minSizeGigabytes` | An integer representing the minimum size of the device in gigabytes.

| `wwn` | A string containing the unique storage identifier. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

| `wwnWithExtension` | A string containing the unique storage identifier with the vendor extension appended. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

| `wwnVendorExtension` | A string containing the unique vendor storage identifier. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

Before installation, you can set the `networkConfig` configuration setting in the `install-config.yaml` file to configure host network interfaces using NMState.

The most common use case for this functionality is to specify a static IP address on the bare-metal network, but you can also configure other networks such as a storage network. This functionality supports other NMState features such as VLAN, VXLAN, bridges, bonds, routes, MTU, and DNS resolver settings.

.Prerequisites

* Configure a `PTR` DNS record with a valid hostname for each node with a static IP address.
* Install the NMState CLI (`nmstate`).

.Procedure

. Optional: Consider testing the NMState syntax with `nmstatectl gc` before including it in the `install-config.yaml` file, because the installer will not check the NMState YAML syntax.

= Configuring host network interfaces for subnets

For edge computing scenarios, it can be beneficial to locate worker nodes closer to the edge. To locate remote worker nodes in subnets, you might use different network segments or subnets for the remote worker nodes than you used for the control plane subnet and local worker nodes. You can reduce latency for the edge and allow for enhanced scalability by setting up subnets for edge computing scenarios.

If you have established different network segments or subnets for remote worker nodes as described in the section on "Establishing communication between subnets", you must specify the subnets in the `machineNetwork` configuration setting if the workers are using static IP addresses, bonds or other advanced networking. When setting the node IP address in the `networkConfig` parameter for each remote worker node, you must also specify the gateway and the DNS server for the subnet containing the control plane nodes when using static IP addresses. This ensures the remote worker nodes can reach the subnet containing the control plane nodes and that they can receive network traffic from the control plane.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All control plane nodes must run in the same subnet. When using more than one subnet, you can also configure the Ingress VIP to run on the control plane nodes by using a manifest. See "Configuring network components to run on the control plane" for details.

Deploying a cluster with multiple subnets requires using virtual media, such as `redfish-virtualmedia` and `idrac-virtualmedia`.

If you don't configure a consistent `ipv6.addr-gen-mode` in these locations, IPv6 address mismatches can occur between CSR resources and `BareMetalHost` resources in the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Install the NMState CLI (`nmstate`).

.Procedure

. Optional: Consider testing the NMState YAML syntax with the `nmstatectl gc` command before including it in the `install-config.yaml` file because the installation program will not check the NMState YAML syntax.

.. Create an NMState YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
interfaces:
- name: eth0
  ipv6:
    addr-gen-mode: <address_mode> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<address_mode>` with the type of address generation mode required for IPv6 addresses in the cluster. Valid values are `eui64`, `stable-privacy`, or `random`.

.. Test the configuration file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ nmstatectl gc <nmstate_yaml_file> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<nmstate_yaml_file>` with the name of the test configuration file.

. Add the NMState configuration to the `hosts.networkConfig` section within the install-config.yaml file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish+http://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: null
        bootMACAddress: <NIC1_mac_address>
        bootMode: UEFI
        rootDeviceHints:
          deviceName: "/dev/sda"
        networkConfig:
          interfaces:
          - name: eth0
            ipv6:
              addr-gen-mode: <address_mode> <1>
...

----
<1> Replace `<address_mode>` with the type of address generation mode required for IPv6 addresses in the cluster. Valid values are `eui64`, `stable-privacy`, or `random`.

Before installation, you can set the `networkConfig` configuration setting in the `install-config.yaml` file to configure host network interfaces using NMState to support dual port NIC.

.Prequisites

* Configure a `PTR` DNS record with a valid hostname for each node with a static IP address.
* Install the NMState CLI (`nmstate`).

[NOTE]
====
Errors in the YAML syntax might result in a failure to apply the network configuration. Additionally, maintaining the validated YAML syntax is useful when applying changes using Kubernetes NMState after deployment or when expanding the cluster.

= Configuring multiple cluster nodes

You can simultaneously configure {product-title} cluster nodes with identical settings. Configuring multiple cluster nodes avoids adding redundant information for each node to the `install-config.yaml` file. This file contains specific parameters to apply an identical configuration to multiple nodes in the cluster.

Compute nodes are configured separately from the controller node. However, configurations for both node types use the highlighted parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file to enable multi-node configuration. Set the `networkConfig` parameters to `BOND`, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
hosts:
- name: ostest-master-0
 [...]
 networkConfig: &BOND
   interfaces:
   - name: bond0
     type: bond
     state: up
     ipv4:
       dhcp: true
       enabled: true
     link-aggregation:
       mode: active-backup
       port:

       - enp3s0
- name: ostest-master-1
 [...]

[id="configuring-managed-secure-boot-in-the-install-config-file_{context}"]
= Optional: Configuring managed Secure Boot

You can enable managed Secure Boot when deploying an installer-provisioned cluster using Redfish BMC addressing, such as `redfish`, `redfish-virtualmedia`, or `idrac-virtualmedia`. To enable managed Secure Boot, add the `bootMode` configuration setting to each node:

[source,yaml]
.Example
----
hosts:
  - name: openshift-master-0
    role: master
    bmc:
      address: redfish://<out_of_band_ip> <1>

    bootMACAddress: <NIC1_mac_address>
    rootDeviceHints:
     deviceName: "/dev/sda"
    bootMode: UEFISecureBoot <2>
----

<1> Ensure the `bmc.address` setting uses `redfish`, `redfish-virtualmedia`, or `idrac-virtualmedia` as the protocol. See "BMC addressing for HPE iLO" or "BMC addressing for Dell iDRAC" for additional details.

<2> The `bootMode` setting is `UEFI` by default. Change it to `UEFISecureBoot` to enable managed Secure Boot.

[NOTE]
====
See "Configuring nodes" in the "Prerequisites" to ensure the nodes can support managed Secure Boot. If the nodes do not support managed Secure Boot, see "Configuring nodes for Secure Boot manually" in the "Configuring nodes" section. Configuring Secure Boot manually requires Redfish virtual media.
====

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not support Secure Boot with IPMI, because IPMI does not provide Secure Boot management facilities.

[id='configure-network-components-to-run-on-the-control-plane_{context}']
= Configuring network components to run on the control plane

You can configure networking components to run exclusively on the control plane nodes. By default, {product-title} allows any node in the machine config pool to host the `ingressVIP` virtual IP address. However, some environments deploy worker nodes in separate subnets from the control plane nodes, which requires configuring the `ingressVIP` virtual IP address to run on the control plane nodes.


[IMPORTANT]
====
When deploying remote workers in separate subnets, you must place the `ingressVIP` virtual IP address exclusively with the control plane nodes.

[id="deploying-routers-on-worker-nodes_{context}"]
= Optional: Deploying routers on worker nodes

During installation, the installer deploys router pods on worker nodes. By default, the installer installs two router pods. If a deployed cluster requires additional routers to handle external traffic loads destined for services within the {product-title} cluster, you can create a `yaml` file to set an appropriate number of router replicas.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Deploying a cluster with only one worker node is not supported. While modifying the router replicas will address issues with the `degraded` state when deploying with one worker, the cluster loses high availability for the ingress API, which is not suitable for production environments.
====

[NOTE]

= Optional: Configuring the RAID

The following procedure configures a redundant array of independent disks (RAID) during the installation process.

[NOTE]
====
. {product-title} supports hardware RAID for baseboard management controllers (BMCs) using the iRMC protocol only. {product-title} {product-version} does not support software RAID.
. If you want to configure a hardware RAID for the node, verify that the node has a RAID controller.
====

.Procedure

. Create the manifests.

. Modify the `BareMetalHost` resource corresponding to the node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ vim clusterconfigs/openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_hosts-*.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The following example uses a hardware RAID configuration because {product-title} {product-version} does not support software RAID.
====
+
.. If you added a specific RAID configuration to the `spec` section, this causes the node to delete the original RAID configuration in the `preparing` phase and perform a specified configuration on the RAID. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  raid:
    hardwareRAIDVolumes:
    - level: "0" <1>
      name: "sda"
      numberOfPhysicalDisks: 1
      rotational: true
      sizeGibibytes: 0
----
<1> `level` is a required field, and the others are optional fields.
+
.. If you added an empty RAID configuration to the `spec` section, the empty configuration causes the node to delete the original RAID configuration during the `preparing` phase, but does not perform a new configuration. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  raid:
    hardwareRAIDVolumes: []
----
+
.. If you do not add a `raid` field in the `spec` section, the original RAID configuration is not deleted, and no new configuration will be performed.

. Create the cluster.

[id="configuring-storage-on-nodes_{context}"]
= Optional: Configuring storage on nodes

You can make changes to operating systems on {product-title} nodes by creating `MachineConfig` objects that are managed by the Machine Config Operator (MCO).

The `MachineConfig` specification includes an ignition config for configuring the machines at first boot. This config object can be used to modify files, systemd services, and other operating system features running on {product-title} machines.

.Procedure

Use the ignition config to configure storage on nodes. The following `MachineSet` manifest example demonstrates how to add a partition to a device on a primary node. In this example, apply the manifest before installation to have a partition named `recovery` with a size of 16 GiB on the primary node.

. Create a `custom-partitions.yaml` file and include a `MachineConfig` object that contains your partition layout:
+
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1

[id="ipi-install-creating-a-disconnected-registry_{context}"]
= Creating a disconnected registry

In some cases, you might want to install an {product-title} cluster using a local copy of the installation registry. This could be for enhancing network efficiency because the cluster nodes are on a network that does not have access to the internet.

A local, or mirrored, copy of the registry requires the following:

* A certificate for the registry node. This can be a self-signed certificate.
* A web server that a container on a system will serve.
* An updated pull secret that contains the certificate and local repository information.

[NOTE]
====
Creating a disconnected registry on a registry node is optional. If you need to create a disconnected registry on a registry node, you must complete all of the following sub-sections.

[id="ipi-install-mirroring-for-disconnected-registry_{context}"]
= Mirroring the {product-title} image repository for a disconnected registry

Complete the following steps to mirror the {product-title} image repository for a disconnected registry.

.Prerequisites

* Your mirror host has access to the internet.
* You configured a mirror registry to use in your restricted network and
can access the certificate and credentials that you configured.
* You downloaded the {cluster-manager-url-pull} and modified it to include authentication to your mirror repository.

.Procedure

. Review the
link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[{product-title} downloads page]
to determine the version of {product-title} that you want to install and determine the corresponding tag on the link:https://quay.io/repository/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release?tab=tags[Repository Tags] page.

. Set the required environment variables:
.. Export the release version:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ OCP_RELEASE=<release_version>
----
+
For `<release_version>`, specify the tag that corresponds to the version of {product-title} to
install, such as `4.5.4`.

.. Export the local registry name and host port:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_REGISTRY='<local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>'
----
+
For `<local_registry_host_name>`, specify the registry domain name for your mirror
repository, and for `<local_registry_host_port>`, specify the port that it
serves content on.

.. Export the local repository name:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_REPOSITORY='<local_repository_name>'
----
+
For `<local_repository_name>`, specify the name of the repository to create in your
registry, such as `ocp4/openshift4`.

.. Export the name of the repository to mirror:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ PRODUCT_REPO='openshift-release-dev'
----
+
For a production release, you must specify `openshift-release-dev`.

.. Export the path to your registry pull secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_SECRET_JSON='<path_to_pull_secret>'
----
+
For `<path_to_pull_secret>`, specify the absolute path to and file name of the pull secret for your mirror registry that you created.

.. Export the release mirror:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ RELEASE_NAME="ocp-release"
----
+
For a production release, you must specify `ocp-release`.

.. Export the type of architecture for your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ARCHITECTURE=<cluster_architecture> <1>
----
<1> Specify the architecture of the cluster, such as `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `s390x`, or `ppc64le`.


.. Export the path to the directory to host the mirrored images:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH=<path> <1>
----
<1> Specify the full path, including the initial forward slash (/) character.

. Mirror the version images to the mirror registry:
** If your mirror host does not have internet access, take the following actions:
... Connect the removable media to a system that is connected to the internet.
... Review the images and configuration manifests to mirror:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON}  \
     --from=quay.io/${PRODUCT_REPO}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE} \
     --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
     --to-release-image=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE} --dry-run
----

... Record the entire `imageContentSources` section from the output of the previous
command. The information about your mirrors is unique to your mirrored repository, and you must add the `imageContentSources` section to the `install-config.yaml` file during installation.
... Mirror the images to a directory on the removable media:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --to-dir=${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror quay.io/${PRODUCT_REPO}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE}
----

... Take the media to the restricted network environment and upload the images to the local container registry.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --from-dir=${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror "file://openshift/release:${OCP_RELEASE}*" ${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} <1>
----
+
<1> For `REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH`, you must use the same path that you specified when you mirrored the images.

** If the local container registry is connected to the mirror host, take the following actions:
... Directly push the release images to the local registry by using following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON}  \
     --from=quay.io/${PRODUCT_REPO}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE} \
     --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
     --to-release-image=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE}
----
+
This command pulls the release information as a digest, and its output includes
the `imageContentSources` data that you require when you install your cluster.

... Record the entire `imageContentSources` section from the output of the previous
command. The information about your mirrors is unique to your mirrored repository, and you must add the `imageContentSources` section to the `install-config.yaml` file during installation.
+
[NOTE]
====
The image name gets patched to Quay.io during the mirroring process, and the podman images will show Quay.io in the registry on the bootstrap virtual machine.
====

. To create the installation program that is based on the content that you
mirrored, extract it and pin it to the release:
** If your mirror host does not have internet access, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release extract -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --command=openshift-baremetal-install "${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}"
----
** If the local container registry is connected to the mirror host, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release extract -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --command=openshift-baremetal-install "${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE}"
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure that you use the correct images for the version of {product-title}
that you selected, you must extract the installation program from the mirrored
content.

You must perform this step on a machine with an active internet connection.

If you are in a disconnected environment, use the `--image` flag as part of must-gather and point to the payload image.
====
+
. For clusters using installer-provisioned infrastructure, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-baremetal-install
