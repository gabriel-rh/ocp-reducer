[id="preparing-to-install-on-vsphere-prerequisites"]
== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.

* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].

* If you use a firewall and plan to use Telemetry, you
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured the firewall to allow the sites] required by your cluster.

* You reviewed your VMware platform licenses. Red Hat does not place any restrictions on your VMware licenses, but some VMware infrastructure components require licensing.

[id="choosing-a-method-to-install-ocp-on-vsphere"]
== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on vSphere

You can install {product-title} with the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/2022/html-single/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/index[{ai-full}]. This method requires no setup for the installer, and is ideal for connected environments like vSphere. Installing with the {ai-full} also provides integration with vSphere, enabling autoscaling. See xref:../../installing/installing_on_prem_assisted/installing-on-prem-assisted.adoc#installing-on-prem-assisted[Installing an on-premise cluster using the {ai-full}] for additional details.

You can also install {product-title} on vSphere by using installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure. Installer-provisioned infrastructure is ideal for installing in environments with air-gapped/restricted networks, where the installation program provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster. You can also install {product-title} on infrastructure that you provide. If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you must manage and maintain the cluster resources yourself.

See the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-process_architecture-installation[Installation process] for more information about installer-provisioned and user-provisioned installation processes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the vSphere platform and the installation process of {product-title}. Use the user-provisioned infrastructure installation instructions as a guide; you are free to create the required resources through other methods.
====


=== Installer-provisioned infrastructure installation of {product-title} on vSphere

Installer-provisioned infrastructure allows the installation program to preconfigure and automate the provisioning of resources required by {product-title}.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned.adoc#installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned[Installing a cluster on vSphere]**: You can install {product-title} on vSphere by using installer-provisioned infrastructure installation with no customization.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations.adoc#installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations[Installing a cluster on vSphere with customizations]**: You can install {product-title} on vSphere by using installer-provisioned infrastructure installation with the default customization options.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-network-customizations.adoc#installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-network-customizations[Installing a cluster on vSphere with network customizations]**: You can install {product-title} on installer-provisioned vSphere infrastructure, with network customizations. You can customize your {product-title} network configuration during installation, so that your cluster can coexist with your existing IP address allocations and adhere to your network requirements.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-restricted-networks-installer-provisioned-vsphere.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-installer-provisioned-vsphere[Installing a cluster on vSphere in a restricted network]**: You can install a cluster on VMware vSphere infrastructure in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content.
 You can use this method to deploy {product-title} on an internal network that is not visible to the internet.

=== User-provisioned infrastructure installation of {product-title} on vSphere

User-provisioned infrastructure requires the user to provision all resources required by {product-title}.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere.adoc#[Installing a cluster on vSphere with user-provisioned infrastructure]**: You can install {product-title} on VMware vSphere infrastructure that you provision.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-network-customizations.adoc#installing-vsphere-network-customizations[Installing a cluster on vSphere with network customizations with user-provisioned infrastructure]**: You can install {product-title} on VMware vSphere infrastructure that you provision with customized network configuration options.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-restricted-networks-vsphere.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-vsphere[Installing a cluster on vSphere in a restricted network with user-provisioned infrastructure]**: {product-title} can be installed on VMware vSphere infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network.

[id="installation-vsphere-infrastructure_{context}"]
= VMware vSphere infrastructure requirements

You must install the {product-title} cluster on a VMware vSphere version 7.0 Update 2 or later instance that meets the requirements for the components that you use.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} version {product-version} supports VMware vSphere version 8.0.
====

You can host the VMware vSphere infrastructure on-premise or on a link:https://cloud.vmware.com/providers[VMware Cloud Verified provider] that meets the requirements outlined in the following tables:

.Version requirements for vSphere virtual environments
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Virtual environment product |Required version
|VMware virtual hardware | 15 or later
|vSphere ESXi hosts | 7.0 Update 2 or later
|vCenter host   | 7.0 Update 2 or later
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must ensure that the time on your ESXi hosts is synchronized before you install {product-title}. See link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-8756D419-A878-4AE0-9183-C6D5A91A8FB1.html[Edit Time Configuration for a Host] in the VMware documentation.
====

.Minimum supported vSphere version for VMware components
|===
|Component | Minimum supported versions |Description

|Hypervisor
|vSphere 7.0 Update 2 and later with virtual hardware version 15
|This version is the minimum version that {op-system-first} supports. For more information about supported hardware on the latest version of {op-system-base-full} that is compatible with {op-system}, see link:https://catalog.redhat.com/hardware/search[Hardware] on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

|Storage with in-tree drivers
|vSphere 7.0 Update 2 and later
|This plugin creates vSphere storage by using the in-tree storage drivers for vSphere included in {product-title}.

|Optional: Networking (NSX-T)
|vSphere 7.0 Update 2 and later
|vSphere 7.0 Update 2 is required for {product-title}. For more information about the compatibility of NSX and {product-title}, see the Release Notes section of VMware's link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Container-Plugin/index.html[NSX container plugin documentation].
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure the best performance conditions for your cluster workloads that operate on {oci-first} and on the {ocvs-first} service, ensure volume performance units (VPUs) for your block volume are sized for your workloads.

The following list provides some guidance in selecting the VPUs needed for specific performance needs:

* Test or proof of concept environment: 100 GB, and 20 to 30 VPUs.
* Base-production environment: 500 GB, and 60 VPUs.
* Heavy-use production environment: More than 500 GB, and 100 or more VPUs.

Consider allocating additional VPUs to give enough capacity for updates and scaling activities. See link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/blockvolumeperformance.htm[Block Volume Performance Levels] in the Oracle documentation.
