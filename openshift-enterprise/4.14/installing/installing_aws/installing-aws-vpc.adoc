toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster into an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The installation program provisions the rest of the required infrastructure, which you can further customize. To customize the installation, you modify
parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before you install the cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installing-aws-account[configured an AWS account] to host the cluster.
* If the existing VPC is owned by a different account than the cluster, you link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared the VPC] between accounts.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have an AWS profile stored on your computer, it must not use a temporary session token that you generated while using a multi-factor authentication device. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must use long-term credentials. To generate appropriate keys, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Managing Access Keys for IAM Users] in the AWS documentation. You can supply the keys when you run the installation program.
====
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

= About using a custom VPC

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can deploy a cluster into existing subnets in an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in Amazon Web Services (AWS). By deploying {product-title} into an existing AWS VPC, you might be able to avoid limit constraints in new accounts or more easily abide by the operational constraints that your company's guidelines set. If you cannot obtain the infrastructure creation permissions that are required to create the VPC yourself, use this installation option.

Because the installation program cannot know what other components are also in your existing subnets, it cannot choose subnet CIDRs and so forth on your behalf. You must configure networking for the subnets that you install your cluster to yourself.

[id="installation-custom-aws-vpc-requirements_{context}"]
== Requirements for using your VPC

The installation program no longer creates the following components:

* Internet gateways
* NAT gateways
* Subnets
* Route tables
* VPCs
* VPC DHCP options
* VPC endpoints

:_mod-docs-content-type: SNIPPET

[NOTE]
====
The installation program requires that you use the cloud-provided DNS server. Using a custom DNS server is not supported and causes the installation to fail.
====

If you use a custom VPC, you must correctly configure it and its subnets for the installation program and the cluster to use. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_wizard.html[Amazon VPC console wizard configurations] and link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/working-with-vpcs.html[Work with VPCs and subnets] in the AWS documentation for more information on creating and managing an AWS VPC.

The installation program cannot:

* Subdivide network ranges for the cluster to use.
* Set route tables for the subnets.
* Set VPC options like DHCP.

You must complete these tasks before you install the cluster. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Networking.html[VPC networking components] and link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html[Route tables for your VPC] for more information on configuring networking in an AWS VPC.

Your VPC must meet the following characteristics:

* Create a public and private subnet for each availability zone that your cluster uses. Each availability zone can contain no more than one public and one private subnet. For an example of this type of configuration, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenario2.html[VPC with public and private subnets (NAT)] in the AWS documentation.
+
Record each subnet ID. Completing the installation requires that you enter these values in the `platform` section of the `install-config.yaml` file. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/managedservices/latest/userguide/find-subnet.html[Finding a subnet ID] in the AWS documentation.
* The VPC's CIDR block must contain the `Networking.MachineCIDR` range, which is the IP address pool for cluster machines. The subnet CIDR blocks must belong to the machine CIDR that you specify.
* The VPC must have a public internet gateway attached to it. For each availability zone:
** The public subnet requires a route to the internet gateway.
** The public subnet requires a NAT gateway with an EIP address.
** The private subnet requires a route to the NAT gateway in public subnet.
* The VPC must not use the `kubernetes.io/cluster/.*: owned`, `Name`, and `openshift.io/cluster` tags.
+
The installation program modifies your subnets to add the `kubernetes.io/cluster/.*: shared` tag, so your subnets must have at least one free tag slot available for it. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html#tag-restrictions[Tag Restrictions] in the AWS documentation to confirm that the installation program can add a tag to each subnet that you specify. You cannot use a `Name` tag, because it overlaps with the EC2 `Name` field and the installation fails.
* You must enable the `enableDnsSupport` and `enableDnsHostnames` attributes in your VPC, so that the cluster can use the Route 53 zones that are attached to the VPC to resolve cluster's internal DNS records. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-support[DNS Support in Your VPC] in the AWS documentation.
+
If you prefer to use your own Route 53 hosted private zone, you must associate the existing hosted zone with your VPC prior to installing a cluster. You can define your hosted zone using the `platform.aws.hostedZone` and `platform.aws.hostedZoneRole` fields in the `install-config.yaml` file.
You can use a private hosted zone from another account by sharing it with the account where you install the cluster. If you use a private hosted zone from another account, you must use the `Passthrough` or `Manual` credentials mode.

If you are working in a disconnected environment, you are unable to reach the public IP addresses for EC2, ELB, and S3 endpoints. Depending on the level to which you want to restrict internet traffic during the installation, the following configuration options are available:


[discrete]
[id="create-vpc-endpoints_{context}"]
=== Option 1: Create VPC endpoints

Create a VPC endpoint and attach it to the subnets that the clusters are using. Name the endpoints as follows:

* `ec2.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com`
* `elasticloadbalancing.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com`
* `s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com`



With this option, network traffic remains private between your VPC and the required AWS services.

[discrete]
[id="create-proxy-without-vpc-endpoints_{context}"]
=== Option 2: Create a proxy without VPC endpoints
As part of the installation process, you can configure an HTTP or HTTPS proxy. With this option, internet traffic goes through the proxy to reach the required AWS services.

[discrete]
[id="create-proxy-with-vpc-endpoints_{context}"]
=== Option 3: Create a proxy with VPC endpoints
As part of the installation process, you can configure an HTTP or HTTPS proxy with VPC endpoints. Create a VPC endpoint and attach it to the subnets that the clusters are using. Name the endpoints as follows:

* `ec2.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com`
* `elasticloadbalancing.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com`
* `s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com`



When configuring the proxy in the `install-config.yaml` file, add these endpoints to the `noProxy` field. With this option, the proxy prevents the cluster from accessing the internet directly. However, network traffic remains private between your VPC and the required AWS services.

.Required VPC components

You must provide a suitable VPC and subnets that allow communication to your
machines.

[cols="2a,7a,3a,3a",options="header"]
|===

|Component
|AWS type
2+|Description

|VPC
|* `AWS::EC2::VPC`
* `AWS::EC2::VPCEndpoint`
2+|You must provide a public VPC for the cluster to use. The VPC uses an
endpoint that references the route tables for each subnet to improve communication with the registry that is hosted in S3.

|Public subnets
|* `AWS::EC2::Subnet`
* `AWS::EC2::SubnetNetworkAclAssociation`
2+|Your VPC must have public subnets for between 1 and 3 availability zones
and associate them with appropriate Ingress rules.

|Internet gateway
|
* `AWS::EC2::InternetGateway`
* `AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment`
* `AWS::EC2::RouteTable`
* `AWS::EC2::Route`
* `AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation`
* `AWS::EC2::NatGateway`
* `AWS::EC2::EIP`
2+|You must have a public internet gateway, with public routes, attached to the
VPC. In the provided templates, each public subnet has a NAT gateway with an EIP address. These NAT gateways allow cluster resources, like private subnet instances, to reach the internet and are not required for some restricted network or proxy scenarios.

.7+|Network access control
.7+| * `AWS::EC2::NetworkAcl`
* `AWS::EC2::NetworkAclEntry`
2+|You must allow the VPC to access the following ports:
h|Port
h|Reason

|`80`
|Inbound HTTP traffic

|`443`
|Inbound HTTPS traffic

|`22`
|Inbound SSH traffic

|`1024` - `65535`
|Inbound ephemeral traffic

|`0` - `65535`
|Outbound ephemeral traffic


|Private subnets
|* `AWS::EC2::Subnet`
* `AWS::EC2::RouteTable`
* `AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation`
2+|Your VPC can have private subnets. The provided CloudFormation templates
can create private subnets for between 1 and 3 availability zones.
If you use private subnets, you must provide appropriate routes and tables
for them.

|===

[id="installation-custom-aws-vpc-validation_{context}"]
== VPC validation

To ensure that the subnets that you provide are suitable, the installation program confirms the following data:

* All the subnets that you specify exist.
* You provide private subnets.
* The subnet CIDRs belong to the machine CIDR that you specified.
* You provide subnets for each availability zone. Each availability zone contains no more than one public and one private subnet. If you use a private cluster, provide only a private subnet for each availability zone. Otherwise, provide exactly one public and private subnet for each availability zone.
* You provide a public subnet for each private subnet availability zone. Machines are not provisioned in availability zones that you do not provide private subnets for.

If you destroy a cluster that uses an existing VPC, the VPC is not deleted. When you remove the {product-title} cluster from a VPC, the `kubernetes.io/cluster/.*: shared` tag is removed from the subnets that it used.

[id="installation-about-custom-aws-permissions_{context}"]
== Division of permissions

Starting with {product-title} 4.3, you do not need all of the permissions that are required for an installation program-provisioned infrastructure cluster to deploy a cluster. This change mimics the division of permissions that you might have at your company: some individuals can create different resource in your clouds than others. For example, you might be able to create application-specific items, like instances, buckets, and load balancers, but not networking-related components such as VPCs, subnets, or ingress rules.

The AWS credentials that you use when you create your cluster do not need the networking permissions that are required to make VPCs and core networking components within the VPC, such as subnets, routing tables, internet gateways, NAT, and VPN. You still need permission to make the application resources that the machines within the cluster require, such as ELBs, security groups, S3 buckets, and nodes.

[id="installation-custom-aws-vpc-isolation_{context}"]
== Isolation between clusters

If you deploy {product-title} to an existing network, the isolation of cluster services is reduced in the following ways:

* You can install multiple {product-title} clusters in the same VPC.
* ICMP ingress is allowed from the entire network.
* TCP 22 ingress (SSH) is allowed to the entire network.
//You can restrict ingress to the control plane and compute security groups by either adding the security groups to an SSH bastion instance or altering rules to allow the bastion.
* Control plane TCP 6443 ingress (Kubernetes API) is allowed to the entire network.
* Control plane TCP 22623 ingress (MCS) is allowed to the entire network.
//This should be restricted to the control plane and compute security groups, instead of the current by-VPC-CIDR logic to avoid leaking sensitive Ignition configs to non-cluster entities sharing the VPC.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="installation-aws-security-groups_{context}"]
= AWS security groups

By default, the installation program creates and attaches security groups to control plane and compute machines. The rules associated with the default security groups cannot be modified.

However, you can apply additional existing AWS security groups, which are associated with your existing VPC, to control plane and compute machines. Applying custom security groups can help you meet the security needs of your organization, in such cases where you need to control the incoming or outgoing traffic of these machines.

As part of the installation process, you apply custom security groups by modifying the `install-config.yaml` file before deploying the cluster.

For more information, see "Applying existing AWS security groups to the cluster".

[id="installation-aws-permissions-iam-shared-vpc_{context}"]
= Modifying trust policy when installing into a shared VPC
If you install your cluster using a shared VPC, you can use the `Passthrough` or `Manual` credentials mode. You must add the IAM role used to install the cluster as a principal in the trust policy of the account that owns the VPC.

If you use `Passthrough` mode, add the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the account that creates the cluster, such as `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/clustercreator`, to the trust policy as a principal.

If you use `Manual` mode, add the ARN of the account that creates the cluster as well as the ARN of the ingress operator role in the cluster owner account, such as `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/<cluster-name>-openshift-ingress-operator-cloud-credentials`, to the trust policy as principals.

You must add the following actions to the policy:

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="ssh-agent-using_{context}"]
= Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

During an {product-title} installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the {op-system-first} nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` list for the `core` user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the {op-system} nodes as the user `core`. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The `./openshift-install gather` command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
====

[NOTE]
====
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific
approaches such as
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[AWS key pairs].
====


.Procedure

. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name> <1>
----
<1> Specify the path and file name, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your `~/.ssh` directory.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you plan to install an {product-title} cluster that uses the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures, do not create a key that uses the `ed25519` algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the `rsa` or `ecdsa` algorithm.
====

. View the public SSH key:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
----
+
For example, run the following to view the `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` public key:
+
[source,termanal]
----
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
----

. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the `./openshift-install gather` command.
+
[NOTE]
====
On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_dsa` are managed automatically.
====
+
.. If the `ssh-agent` process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Agent pid 31874
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.
====

. Add your SSH private key to the `ssh-agent`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh-add <path>/<file_name> <1>
----
<1> Specify the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
----

.Next steps

* When you install {product-title}, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.

[id="installation-obtaining-installer_{context}"]
= Obtaining the installation program

Before you install {product-title}, download the installation file on
 your provisioning machine.
 the host you are using for installation.
//mpytlak: Added "private" in the context of a review for the IBM Cloud VPC private work. In an effort to keep updates to other platforms separate, I will open a doc story for each platform that supports a private install.

.Prerequisites

* You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with 500 MB of local disk space.

.Procedure

. Access the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install[Infrastructure Provider] page on the {cluster-manager} site. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.
. Select your infrastructure provider.
. Navigate to the page for your installation type, download the installation program that corresponds with your host operating system and architecture, and place the file in the directory where you will store the installation configuration files.

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both files are required to delete the cluster.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the {product-title} uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider.
====

. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux
operating system, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
----

. Download your installation {cluster-manager-url-pull}. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for {product-title} components.

[id="installation-initializing_{context}"]
= Creating the installation configuration file

You can customize the {product-title} cluster you install on
Amazon Web Services (AWS).

.Prerequisites

* You have the {product-title} installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

.Procedure

. Create the `install-config.yaml` file.
+
.. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir <installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.
+
When specifying the directory:
* Verify that the directory has the `execute` permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.
* Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier {product-title} version.
+
[NOTE]
=====
Always delete the `~/.powervs` directory to avoid reusing a stale configuration. Run the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
$ rm -rf ~/.powervs
----
=====
.. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
... Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.
====
... Select *AWS* as the platform to target.
... If you do not have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) profile stored on your computer, enter the AWS
access key ID and secret access key for the user that you configured to run the
installation program.
... Select the AWS region to deploy the cluster to.
... Select the base domain for the Route 53 service that you configured for your cluster.
... Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
+


. Modify the `install-config.yaml` file. You can find more information about the available parameters in the "Installation configuration parameters" section.






. Back up the `install-config.yaml` file so that you can use
it to install multiple clusters.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `install-config.yaml` file is consumed during the installation process. If
you want to reuse the file, you must back it up now.
====


You now have the file `install-config.yaml` in the directory that you specified.

1. One vCPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs.
2. {product-title} and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and faster storage is recommended, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes which require a 10 ms p99 fsync duration. Note that on many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to over-allocate storage volume to obtain sufficient performance.
3. As with all user-provisioned installations, if you choose to use {op-system-base} compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks. Use of {op-system-base} 7 compute machines is deprecated and has been removed in {product-title} 4.10 and later.
--


If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in {product-title}.

<1> Required. The installation program prompts you for this value.
<2> Optional: Add this parameter to force the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) to use the specified mode. By default, the CCO uses the root credentials in the `kube-system` namespace to dynamically try to determine the capabilities of the credentials. For details about CCO modes, see the "About the Cloud Credential Operator" section in the _Authentication and authorization_ guide.
<3> If you do not provide these parameters and values, the installation program
provides the default value.
<4> The `controlPlane` section is a single mapping, but the `compute` section is a
sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures,
the first line of the `compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`, and the
first line of the `controlPlane` section must not. Only one control plane pool is used.
<5> Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or
`hyperthreading`. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled
to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by
setting the parameter value to `Disabled`. If you disable simultaneous
multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster
machines.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning
accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance. Use larger
instance types, such as `m4.2xlarge` or `m5.2xlarge`, for your machines if you
disable simultaneous multithreading.
====
<6> To configure faster storage for etcd, especially for larger clusters, set the storage type as `io1` and set `iops` to `2000`.
<7> Whether to require the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html[Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service v2] (IMDSv2). To require IMDSv2, set the parameter value to `Required`. To allow the use of both IMDSv1 and IMDSv2, set the parameter value to `Optional`. If no value is specified, both IMDSv1 and IMDSv2 are allowed.
+
[NOTE]
====
The IMDS configuration for control plane machines that is set during cluster installation can only be changed by using the AWS CLI. The IMDS configuration for compute machines can be changed by using compute machine sets.
====
<8> The cluster network plugin to install. The supported values are `OVNKubernetes` and `OpenShiftSDN`. The default value is `OVNKubernetes`.
<9> If you provide your own VPC, specify subnets for each availability zone that your cluster uses.
<10> The ID of the AMI used to boot machines for the cluster. If set, the AMI
must belong to the same region as the cluster.
<11> The AWS service endpoints. Custom endpoints are required when installing to
an unknown AWS region. The endpoint URL must use the `https` protocol and the
host must trust the certificate.
<12> The ID of your existing Route 53 private hosted zone. Providing an existing hosted zone requires that you supply your own VPC and the hosted zone is already associated with the VPC prior to installing your cluster. If undefined, the installation program creates a new hosted zone.
<13> Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the {op-system-first} machines that {product-title} runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with {op-system} instead.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a {op-system-base-full} computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on RHEL, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/assembly_installing-the-system-in-fips-mode_security-hardening[Installing the system in FIPS mode]. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
====
<14> You can optionally provide the `sshKey` value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="installation-configure-proxy_{context}"]
= Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have
an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new {product-title}
cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the
`install-config.yaml` file.



.Prerequisites

* You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.
// TODO: xref (../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall)
* You reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the `Proxy` object's `spec.noProxy` field to bypass the proxy if necessary.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field is populated with the values of the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr`, `networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr`, and `networking.serviceNetwork[]` fields from your installation configuration.

For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and {rh-openstack-first}, the `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`).
====

.Procedure

. Edit your `install-config.yaml` file and add the proxy settings. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> <1>
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> <2>
  noProxy: ec2.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com,elasticloadbalancing.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com,s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com <3>
additionalTrustBundle: | <4>
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle> <5>
----
<1> A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The
URL scheme must be `http`.
<2> A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.
<3> A comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with `.` to match subdomains only. For example, `.y.com` matches `x.y.com`, but not `y.com`. Use `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations.
If you have added the Amazon `EC2`,`Elastic Load Balancing`, and `S3` VPC endpoints to your VPC, you must add these endpoints to the `noProxy` field.
<4> If provided, the installation program generates a config map that is named `user-ca-bundle` in
the `openshift-config` namespace that contains one or more additional CA
certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections. The Cluster Network
Operator then creates a `trusted-ca-bundle` config map that merges these contents
with the {op-system-first} trust bundle, and this config map is referenced in the `trustedCA` field of the `Proxy` object. The `additionalTrustBundle` field is required unless
the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the {op-system} trust
bundle.
<5> Optional: The policy to determine the configuration of the `Proxy` object to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map in the `trustedCA` field. The allowed values are `Proxyonly` and `Always`. Use `Proxyonly` to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map only when `http/https` proxy is configured. Use `Always` to always reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map. The default value is `Proxyonly`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The installation program does not support the proxy `readinessEndpoints` field.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
If the installer times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the `wait-for` command of the installer. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
----
====

. Save the file and reference it when installing {product-title}.

The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named `cluster` that uses the proxy
settings in the provided `install-config.yaml` file. If no proxy settings are
provided, a `cluster` `Proxy` object is still created, but it will have a nil
`spec`.

[NOTE]
====
Only the `Proxy` object named `cluster` is supported, and no additional
proxies can be created.

[id="installation-aws-vpc-security-groups_{context}"]
= Applying existing AWS security groups to the cluster

Applying existing AWS security groups to your control plane and compute machines can help you meet the security needs of your organization, in such cases where you need to control the incoming or outgoing traffic of these machines.

.Prerequisites
* You have created the security groups in AWS. For more information, see the AWS documentation about working with link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html[security groups].
* The security groups must be associated with the existing VPC that you are deploying the cluster to. The security groups cannot be associated with another VPC.
* You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.

.Procedure

. In the `install-config.yaml` file, edit the `compute.platform.aws.additionalSecurityGroupIDs` parameter to specify one or more custom security groups for your compute machines.
. Edit the `controlPlane.platform.aws.additionalSecurityGroupIDs` parameter to specify one or more custom security groups for your control plane machines.
. Save the file and reference it when deploying the cluster.

.Sample `install-config.yaml` file that specifies custom security groups

//For providers that support multiple modes of operation
The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) can be put into manual mode prior to installation in environments where the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not reachable, or the administrator prefers not to store an administrator-level credential secret in the cluster `kube-system` namespace.

//For providers who only support manual mode

.Procedure

. If you did not set the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` configuration file to `Manual`, modify the value as shown:
+
.Sample configuration file snippet
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
credentialsMode: Manual
# ...
----

. If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install create manifests
----

. Set a `$RELEASE_IMAGE` variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
----

. Extract the list of `CredentialsRequest` custom resources (CRs) from the {product-title} release image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \// <1>
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \// <2>
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> <3>
----
<1> The `--included` parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
<2> Specify the location of the `install-config.yaml` file.
<3> Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the `CredentialsRequest` objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.
+
This command creates a YAML file for each `CredentialsRequest` object.
+
.Sample `CredentialsRequest` object

==== Creating AWS resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

You have the following options when creating AWS resources:

* You can use the `ccoctl aws create-all` command to create the AWS resources automatically. This is the quickest way to create the resources. See xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-vpc.adoc#cco-ccoctl-creating-at-once_installing-aws-vpc[Creating AWS resources with a single command].

* If you need to review the JSON files that the `ccoctl` tool creates before modifying AWS resources, or if the process the `ccoctl` tool uses to create AWS resources automatically does not meet the requirements of your organization, you can create the AWS resources individually. See xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-vpc.adoc#cco-ccoctl-creating-individually_installing-aws-vpc[Creating AWS resources individually].

= Creating AWS resources with a single command

If the process the `ccoctl` tool uses to create AWS resources automatically meets the requirements of your organization, you can use the `ccoctl aws create-all` command to automate the creation of AWS resources.

Otherwise, you can create the AWS resources individually. For more information, see "Creating AWS resources individually".


[NOTE]
====
By default, `ccoctl` creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. To create the objects in a different directory, use the `--output-dir` flag. This procedure uses `<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>` to refer to this directory.
====

.Prerequisites

You must have:

* Extracted and prepared the `ccoctl` binary.

.Procedure

. Set a `$RELEASE_IMAGE` variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

----
<1> Specify the name used to tag any cloud resources that are created for tracking.
<2> Specify the AWS region in which cloud resources will be created.
<3> Specify the directory containing the files for the component `CredentialsRequest` objects.
<4> Optional: Specify the directory in which you want the `ccoctl` utility to create objects. By default, the utility creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run.
<5> Optional: By default, the `ccoctl` utility stores the OpenID Connect (OIDC) configuration files in a public S3 bucket and uses the S3 URL as the public OIDC endpoint. To store the OIDC configuration in a private S3 bucket that is accessed by the IAM identity provider through a public CloudFront distribution URL instead, use the `--create-private-s3-bucket` parameter.

= Creating AWS resources individually

You can use the `ccoctl` tool to create AWS resources individually. This option might be useful for an organization that shares the responsibility for creating these resources among different users or departments.

Otherwise, you can use the `ccoctl aws create-all` command to create the AWS resources automatically. For more information, see "Creating AWS resources with a single command".

[NOTE]
====
By default, `ccoctl` creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. To create the objects in a different directory, use the `--output-dir` flag. This procedure uses `<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>` to refer to this directory.

Some `ccoctl` commands make AWS API calls to create or modify AWS resources. You can use the `--dry-run` flag to avoid making API calls. Using this flag creates JSON files on the local file system instead. You can review and modify the JSON files and then apply them with the AWS CLI tool using the `--cli-input-json` parameters.
====

.Prerequisites

* Extract and prepare the `ccoctl` binary.

.Procedure

. Generate the public and private RSA key files that are used to set up the OpenID Connect provider for the cluster by running the following command:

----
+
where `serviceaccount-signer.private` and `serviceaccount-signer.public` are the generated key files.
+
This command also creates a private key that the cluster requires during installation in `/<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/tls/bound-service-account-signing-key.key`.

. Create an OpenID Connect identity provider and S3 bucket on AWS by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ccoctl aws create-identity-provider \
  --name=<name> \// <1>
  --region=<aws_region> \// <2>
  --public-key-file=<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/serviceaccount-signer.public <3>
----
<1> `<name>` is the name used to tag any cloud resources that are created for tracking.
<2> `<aws-region>` is the AWS region in which cloud resources will be created.
<3> `<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>` is the path to the public key file that the `ccoctl aws create-key-pair` command generated.

----
+
where `openid-configuration` is a discovery document and `keys.json` is a JSON web key set file.
+
This command also creates a YAML configuration file in `/<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests/cluster-authentication-02-config.yaml`. This file sets the issuer URL field for the service account tokens that the cluster generates, so that the AWS IAM identity provider trusts the tokens.

. Create IAM roles for each component in the cluster:

.. Set a `$RELEASE_IMAGE` variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
----

.. Extract the list of `CredentialsRequest` objects from the {product-title} release image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \// <1>
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \// <2>
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> <3>
----
<1> The `--included` parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
<2> Specify the location of the `install-config.yaml` file.
<3> Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the `CredentialsRequest` objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.

.. Use the `ccoctl` tool to process all `CredentialsRequest` objects by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ccoctl aws create-iam-roles \
  --name=<name> \
  --region=<aws_region> \
  --credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_credentials_requests_directory> \
  --identity-provider-arn=arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:oidc-provider/<name>-oidc.s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com
----
+
[NOTE]
====
For AWS environments that use alternative IAM API endpoints, such as GovCloud, you must also specify your region with the `--region` parameter.

If your cluster uses Technology Preview features that are enabled by the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set, you must include the `--enable-tech-preview` parameter.
====
+
For each `CredentialsRequest` object, `ccoctl` creates an IAM role with a trust policy that is tied to the specified OIDC identity provider, and a permissions policy as defined in each `CredentialsRequest` object from the {product-title} release image.

[id="cco-ccoctl-install-creating-manifests_{context}"]
= Incorporating the Cloud Credential Operator utility manifests

To implement short-term security credentials managed outside the cluster for individual components, you must move the manifest files that the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) created to the correct directories for the installation program.

.Prerequisites

* You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
* You have configured the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`).
* You have created the cloud provider resources that are required for your cluster with the `ccoctl` utility.

.Procedure

. If you did not set the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` configuration file to `Manual`, modify the value as shown:
+
.Sample configuration file snippet
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
credentialsMode: Manual
# ...
----

. If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install create manifests
----

. Copy the manifests that the `ccoctl` utility generated to the `manifests` directory that the installation program created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ cp /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests/* ./manifests/
----

. Copy the private key that the `ccoctl` utility generated in the `tls` directory to the installation directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ cp -a /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/tls .

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="installation-launching-installer_{context}"]
= Deploying the cluster

You can install {product-title} on a compatible cloud platform.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can run the `create cluster` command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.

* You have the {product-title} installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
* You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.

.Procedure

. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and initialize the cluster deployment:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \ <1>
    --log-level=info <2>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the
location of your customized `./install-config.yaml` file.
<2> To view different installation details, specify `warn`, `debug`, or
`error` instead of `info`.



. Optional: Remove or disable the `AdministratorAccess` policy from the IAM
account that you used to install the cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The elevated permissions provided by the `AdministratorAccess` policy are required only during installation.
====


.Verification
When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

* The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the `kubeadmin` user.
* Credential information also outputs to `<installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
====

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for _Recovering from expired control plane certificates_ for more information.

* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

= Telemetry access for {product-title}

In {product-title} {product-version}, the Telemetry service, which runs by default to provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, requires internet access. If your cluster is connected to the internet, Telemetry runs automatically, and your cluster is registered to {cluster-manager-url}.

After you confirm that your {cluster-manager-url} inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using {cluster-manager}, link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/subscription_central/2020-04/html/getting_started_with_subscription_watch/con-how-to-select-datacollection-tool_assembly-requirements-and-your-responsibilities-ctxt#red_hat_openshift[use subscription watch] to track your {product-title} subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level.
