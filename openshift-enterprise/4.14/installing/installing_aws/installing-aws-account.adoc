Before you can install {product-title}, you must configure an
Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="installation-aws-route53_{context}"]
= Configuring Route 53

To install {product-title}, the Amazon Web Services (AWS) account you use must
have a dedicated public hosted zone in your Route 53 service. This zone must be
authoritative for the domain. The Route 53 service provides
cluster DNS resolution and name lookup for external connections to the cluster.

.Procedure

. Identify your domain, or subdomain, and registrar. You can transfer an existing domain and
registrar or obtain a new one through AWS or another source.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you purchase a new domain through AWS, it takes time for the relevant DNS
changes to propagate. For more information about purchasing domains
through AWS, see
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar.html[Registering Domain Names Using Amazon Route 53]
in the AWS documentation.
====

. If you are using an existing domain and registrar, migrate its DNS to AWS. See
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html[Making Amazon Route 53 the DNS Service for an Existing Domain]
in the AWS documentation.

. Create a public hosted zone for your domain or subdomain. See
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/CreatingHostedZone.html[Creating a Public Hosted Zone]
in the AWS documentation.
+
Use an appropriate root domain, such as `openshiftcorp.com`, or subdomain,
such as `clusters.openshiftcorp.com`.

. Extract the new authoritative name servers from the hosted zone records. See
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/GetInfoAboutHostedZone.html[Getting the Name Servers for a Public Hosted Zone]
in the AWS documentation.

. Update the registrar records for the AWS Route 53 name servers that your domain
uses. For example, if you registered your domain to a Route 53 service in a
different accounts, see the following topic in the AWS documentation:
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-name-servers-glue-records.html#domain-name-servers-glue-records-procedure[Adding or Changing Name Servers or Glue Records].

. If you are using a subdomain, add its delegation records to the parent domain. This gives Amazon Route 53 responsibility for the subdomain. Follow the delegation procedure outlined by the DNS provider of the parent domain. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/CreatingNewSubdomain.html[Creating a subdomain that uses Amazon Route 53 as the DNS service without migrating the parent domain] in the AWS documentation for an example high level procedure.

[id="nw-endpoint-route53_{context}"]
= Ingress Operator endpoint configuration for AWS Route 53

If you install in either Amazon Web Services (AWS) GovCloud (US) US-West or US-East region, the Ingress Operator uses `us-gov-west-1` region for Route53 and tagging API clients.

The Ingress Operator uses `https://tagging.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com` as the tagging API endpoint if a tagging custom endpoint is configured that includes the string 'us-gov-east-1'.

For more information on AWS GovCloud (US) endpoints, see the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/using-govcloud-endpoints.html[Service Endpoints] in the AWS documentation about GovCloud (US).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Private, disconnected installations are not supported for AWS GovCloud when you install in the `us-gov-east-1` region.
====

.Example Route 53 configuration
[source,yaml]
----
platform:
  aws:
    region: us-gov-west-1
    serviceEndpoints:
    - name: ec2
      url: https://ec2.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com

      url: https://route53.us-gov.amazonaws.com <1>
    - name: tagging
      url: https://tagging.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com <2>
----
<1> Route 53 defaults to `https://route53.us-gov.amazonaws.com` for both AWS GovCloud (US) regions.
<2> Only the US-West region has endpoints for tagging. Omit this parameter if your cluster is in another region.

[id="installation-aws-limits_{context}"]
= AWS account limits

The {product-title} cluster uses a number of Amazon Web Services (AWS)
components, and the default
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html[Service Limits]
affect your ability to install {product-title} clusters. If you use certain
cluster configurations, deploy your cluster in certain AWS regions, or
run multiple clusters from your account, you might need
to request additional resources for your AWS account.

The following table summarizes the AWS components whose limits can impact your
ability to install and run {product-title} clusters.

[cols="2a,3a,3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Component |Number of clusters available by default| Default AWS limit |Description

|Instance Limits
|Varies
|Varies
|By default, each cluster creates the following instances:

* One bootstrap machine, which is removed after installation
* Three control plane nodes
* Three worker nodes

These instance type counts are within a new account's default limit. To deploy
more worker nodes, enable autoscaling, deploy large workloads, or use a
different instance type, review your account limits to ensure that your cluster
can deploy the machines that you need.

In most regions, the worker machines use an `m6i.large` instance
and the bootstrap and control plane machines use `m6i.xlarge` instances. In some regions, including
all regions that do not support these instance types, `m5.large` and `m5.xlarge`
instances are used instead.

|Elastic IPs (EIPs)
|0 to 1
|5 EIPs per account
|To provision the cluster in a highly available configuration, the installation program
creates a public and private subnet for each
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html[availability zone within a region].
Each private subnet requires a
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT Gateway],
and each NAT gateway requires a separate
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html[elastic IP].
Review the
link:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/[AWS region map] to
determine how many availability zones are in each region. To take advantage of
the default high availability, install the cluster in a region with at least
three availability zones. To install a cluster in a region with more than five
availability zones, you must increase the EIP limit.
[IMPORTANT]
====
To use the `us-east-1` region, you must increase the EIP limit for your account.
====

|Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)
|5
|5 VPCs per region
|Each cluster creates its own VPC.

|Elastic Load Balancing (ELB/NLB)
|3
|20 per region
|By default, each cluster creates internal and external network load balancers for the master
API server and a single Classic Load Balancer for the router. Deploying
more Kubernetes `Service` objects with type `LoadBalancer` will create additional
link:https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/[load balancers].


|NAT Gateways
|5
|5 per availability zone
|The cluster deploys one NAT gateway in each availability zone.

|Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)
|At least 12
|350 per region
|The default installation creates 21 ENIs and an ENI for each availability zone
in your region. For example, the `us-east-1` region contains six availability
zones, so a cluster that is deployed in that zone uses 27 ENIs. Review the
link:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/[AWS region map] to
determine how many availability zones are in each region.

Additional ENIs are created for additional machines and ELB load balancers
that are created by cluster usage and deployed workloads.

|VPC Gateway
|20
|20 per account
|Each cluster creates a single VPC Gateway for S3 access.


|S3 buckets
|99
|100 buckets per account
|Because the installation process creates a temporary bucket and the registry
component in each cluster creates a bucket, you can create only 99
{product-title} clusters per AWS account.

|Security Groups
|250
|2,500 per account
|Each cluster creates 10 distinct security groups.
                                                                                                                                        | Fail, optionally surfacing response body to the user

[id="installation-aws-permissions_{context}"]
= Required AWS permissions for the IAM user

[NOTE]
====
Your IAM user must have the permission `tag:GetResources` in the region `us-east-1` to delete the base cluster resources. As part of the AWS API requirement, the {product-title} installation program performs various actions in this region.
====

When you attach the `AdministratorAccess` policy to the IAM user that you create in Amazon Web Services (AWS),
you grant that user all of the required permissions. To deploy all components of an {product-title}
cluster, the IAM user requires the following permissions:

[id="installation-aws-iam-user_{context}"]
= Creating an IAM user

Each Amazon Web Services (AWS) account contains a root user account that is
based on the email address you used to create the account. This is a
highly-privileged account, and it is recommended to use it for only initial
account and billing configuration, creating an initial set of users, and
securing the account.

Before you install {product-title}, create a secondary IAM
administrative user. As you complete the
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html[Creating an IAM User in Your AWS Account]
procedure in the AWS documentation, set the following options:

.Procedure

. Specify the IAM user name and select `Programmatic access`.

. Attach the `AdministratorAccess` policy to ensure that the account has
sufficient permission to create the cluster. This policy provides the cluster
with the ability to grant credentials to each {product-title} component. The
cluster grants the components only the credentials that they require.
+
[NOTE]
====
While it is possible to create a policy that grants the all of the required
AWS permissions and attach it to the user, this is not the preferred option.
The cluster will not have the ability to grant additional credentials to
individual components, so the same credentials are used by all components.
====

. Optional: Add metadata to the user by attaching tags.

. Confirm that the user name that you specified is granted the
`AdministratorAccess` policy.

. Record the access key ID and secret access key values. You must use these
values when you configure your local machine to run the installation program.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot use a temporary session token that you generated while using a
multi-factor authentication device to authenticate to AWS when you deploy a
cluster. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to
create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must
use key-based, long-term credentials.

= IAM Policies and AWS authentication

By default, the installation program creates instance profiles for the bootstrap, control plane, and compute instances with the necessary permissions for the cluster to operate.

However, you can create your own IAM roles and specify them as part of the installation process. You might need to specify your own roles to deploy the cluster or to manage the cluster after installation. For example:

* Your organization's security policies require that you use a more restrictive set of permissions to install the cluster.
* After the installation, the cluster is configured with an Operator that requires access to additional services.

If you choose to specify your own IAM roles, you can take the following steps:

* Begin with the default policies and adapt as required. For more information, see "Default permissions for IAM instance profiles".
* Use the AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer (IAM Access Analyzer) to create a policy template that is based on the cluster's activity. For more information see, "Using AWS IAM Analyzer to create policy templates".

[id="specify-an-existing-iam-role_{context}"]
= Specifying an existing IAM role

Instead of allowing the installation program to create IAM instance profiles with the default permissions, you can use the `install-config.yaml` file to specify an existing IAM role for control plane and compute instances.

.Prerequisites

* You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.

.Procedure

. Update `compute.platform.aws.iamRole` with an existing role for the control plane machines.
+
.Sample `install-config.yaml` file with an IAM role for compute instances
[source,yaml]
----
compute:
- hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: worker
  platform:
    aws:
      iamRole: ExampleRole
----
. Update `controlPlane.platform.aws.iamRole` with an existing role for the compute machines.

----
. Save the file and reference it when installing the {product-title} cluster.

[id="create-custom-permissions-for-iam-instance-profiles_{context}"]
= Using AWS IAM Analyzer to create policy templates

The minimal set of permissions that the control plane and compute instance profiles require depends on how the cluster is configured for its daily operation.

One way to determine which permissions the cluster instances require is to use the AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer (IAM Access Analyzer) to create a policy template:

* A policy template contains the permissions the cluster has used over a specified period of time.
* You can then use the template to create policies with fine-grained permissions.

.Procedure

The overall process could be:

. Ensure that CloudTrail is enabled. CloudTrail records all of the actions and events in your AWS account, including the API calls that are required to create a policy template. For more information, see the AWS documentation for https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-getting-started.html[working with CloudTrail].
. Create an instance profile for control plane instances and an instance profile for compute instances. Be sure to assign each role a permissive policy, such as PowerUserAccess. For more information, see the AWS documentation for
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html[creating instance profile roles].
. Install the cluster in a development environment and configure it as required. Be sure to deploy all of applications the cluster will host in a production environment.
. Test the cluster thoroughly. Testing the cluster ensures that all of the required API calls are logged.
. Use the IAM Access Analyzer to create a policy template for each instance profile. For more information, see the AWS documentation for https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-generation.html[generating policies based on the CloudTrail logs].
. Create and add a fine-grained policy to each instance profile.
. Remove the permissive policy from each instance profile.
. Deploy a production cluster using the existing instance profiles with the new policies.

[NOTE]
====
You can add https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html[IAM Conditions] to your policy to make it more restrictive and compliant with your organization security requirements.
