toc::[]

You can configure MetalLB so that the IP address is advertised with layer 2 protocols, the BGP protocol, or both.
With layer 2, MetalLB provides a fault-tolerant external IP address. With BGP, MetalLB provides fault-tolerance for the external IP address and load balancing.

MetalLB supports advertising using L2 and BGP for the same set of IP addresses.

MetalLB provides the flexibility to assign address pools to specific BGP peers effectively to a subset of nodes on the network. This allows for more complex configurations, for example facilitating the isolation of nodes or the segmentation of the network.

= About the BGPAdvertisement custom resource

The fields for the `BGPAdvertisements` object are defined in the following table:

.BGPAdvertisements configuration
[cols="1,1,3a", options="header"]
|===

|Field
|Type
|Description

|`metadata.name`
|`string`
|Specifies the name for the BGP advertisement.

|`metadata.namespace`
|`string`
|Specifies the namespace for the BGP advertisement.
Specify the same namespace that the MetalLB Operator uses.

|`spec.aggregationLength`
|`integer`
|Optional: Specifies the number of bits to include in a 32-bit CIDR mask.
To aggregate the routes that the speaker advertises to BGP peers, the mask is applied to the routes for several service IP addresses and the speaker advertises the aggregated route.
For example, with an aggregation length of `24`, the speaker can aggregate several `10.0.1.x/32` service IP addresses and advertise a single `10.0.1.0/24` route.

|`spec.aggregationLengthV6`
|`integer`
|Optional: Specifies the number of bits to include in a 128-bit CIDR mask.
For example, with an aggregation length of `124`, the speaker can aggregate several `fc00:f853:0ccd:e799::x/128` service IP addresses and advertise a single `fc00:f853:0ccd:e799::0/124` route.

|`spec.communities`
|`string`
|Optional: Specifies one or more BGP communities.
Each community is specified as two 16-bit values separated by the colon character.
Well-known communities must be specified as 16-bit values:

* `NO_EXPORT`: `65535:65281`
* `NO_ADVERTISE`: `65535:65282`
* `NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED`: `65535:65283`
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also use community objects that are created along with the strings.
====

|`spec.localPref`
|`integer`
|Optional: Specifies the local preference for this advertisement.
This BGP attribute applies to BGP sessions within the Autonomous System.

|`spec.ipAddressPools`
|`string`
|Optional: The list of `IPAddressPools` to advertise with this advertisement, selected by name.

|`spec.ipAddressPoolSelectors`
|`string`
|Optional: A selector for the `IPAddressPools` that gets advertised with this advertisement. This is for associating the `IPAddressPool` to the advertisement based on the label assigned to the `IPAddressPool` instead of the name itself. If no `IPAddressPool` is selected by this or by the list, the advertisement is applied to all the `IPAddressPools`.

|`spec.nodeSelectors`
|`string`
|Optional: `NodeSelectors` allows to limit the nodes to announce as next hops for the load balancer IP. When empty, all the nodes are announced as next hops.

|`spec.peers`
|`string`
|Optional: Peers limits the BGP peer to advertise the IPs of the selected pools to. When empty, the load balancer IP is announced to all the BGP peers configured.

[id="nw-metallb-configure-BGP-advertisement-advanced-use-case_{context}"]
= Configuring MetalLB with a BGP advertisement and an advanced use case

Configure MetalLB as follows so that MetalLB assigns IP addresses to load-balancer services in the ranges between `203.0.113.200` and `203.0.113.203` and between `fc00:f853:ccd:e799::0` and `fc00:f853:ccd:e799::f`.

To explain the two BGP advertisements, consider an instance when MetalLB assigns the IP address of `203.0.113.200` to a service.
With that IP address as an example, the speaker advertises two routes to BGP peers:

* `203.0.113.200/32`, with `localPref` set to `100` and the community set to the numeric value of the `NO_ADVERTISE` community.
This specification indicates to the peer routers that they can use this route but they should not propagate information about this route to BGP peers.

* `203.0.113.200/30`, aggregates the load-balancer IP addresses assigned by MetalLB into a single route.
MetalLB advertises the aggregated route to BGP peers with the community attribute set to `8000:800`.
BGP peers propagate the `203.0.113.200/30` route to other BGP peers.
When traffic is routed to a node with a speaker, the `203.0.113.200/32` route is used to forward the traffic into the cluster and to a pod that is associated with the service.

As you add more services and MetalLB assigns more load-balancer IP addresses from the pool, peer routers receive one local route, `203.0.113.20x/32`, for each service, as well as the `203.0.113.200/30` aggregate route.
Each service that you add generates the `/30` route, but MetalLB deduplicates the routes to one BGP advertisement before communicating with peer routers.

= Advertising an IP address pool from a subset of nodes

To advertise an IP address from an IP addresses pool, from a specific set of nodes only, use the `.spec.nodeSelector` specification in the BGPAdvertisement custom resource. This specification associates a pool of IP addresses with a set of nodes in the cluster. This is useful when you have nodes on different subnets in a cluster and you want to advertise an IP addresses from an address pool from a specific subnet, for example a public-facing subnet only.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create an IP address pool by using a custom resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: pool1
spec:
  addresses:

    - 2001:100:4::200-2001:100:4::400
----

. Control which nodes in the cluster the IP address from `pool1` advertises from by defining the `.spec.nodeSelector` value in the BGPAdvertisement custom resource:

In this example, the IP address from `pool1` advertises from `NodeA` and `NodeB` only.

= Configuring MetalLB with an L2 advertisement for selected interfaces

By default, the IP addresses from IP address pool that has been assigned to the service, is advertised from all the network interfaces. The `interfaces` field in the `L2Advertisement` custom resource definition is used to restrict those network interfaces that advertise the IP address pool.

This example shows how to configure MetalLB so that the IP address pool is advertised only from the network interfaces listed in the `interfaces` field of all nodes.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You are logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create an IP address pool.

.. Create a file, such as `ipaddresspool.yaml`, and enter the configuration details like the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: doc-example-l2
spec:
  addresses:
    - 4.4.4.0/24
  autoAssign: false
----

.. Apply the configuration for the IP address pool like the following example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ipaddresspool.yaml
----

. Create a L2 advertisement advertising the IP with `interfaces` selector.

.. Create a YAML file, such as `l2advertisement.yaml`, and enter the configuration details like the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: l2advertisement
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
   - doc-example-l2
   interfaces:
   - interfaceA
   - interfaceB
----

.. Apply the configuration for the advertisement like the following example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f l2advertisement.yaml
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The interface selector does not affect how MetalLB chooses the node to announce a given IP by using L2. The chosen node does not announce the service if the node does not have the selected interface.
