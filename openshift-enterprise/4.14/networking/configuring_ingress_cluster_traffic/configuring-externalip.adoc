toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can designate an IP address block that is external to the cluster that can send traffic to services in the cluster.

This functionality is generally most useful for clusters installed on bare-metal hardware.

== Prerequisites

* Your network infrastructure must route traffic for the external IP addresses to your cluster.

:leveloffset: +1

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * networking/configuring_ingress_cluster_traffic/configuring-externalip.adoc

[id="nw-externalip-about_{context}"]
= About ExternalIP

For non-cloud environments, {product-title} supports the assignment of external IP addresses to a `Service` object `spec.externalIPs[]` field through the *ExternalIP* facility.
By setting this field, {product-title} assigns an additional virtual IP address to the service. The IP address can be outside the service network defined for the cluster.
A service configured with an ExternalIP functions similarly to a service with `type=NodePort`, allowing you to direct traffic to a local node for load balancing.

You must configure your networking infrastructure to ensure that the external IP address blocks that you define are routed to the cluster.

{product-title} extends the ExternalIP functionality in Kubernetes by adding the following capabilities:

- Restrictions on the use of external IP addresses by users through a configurable policy
- Allocation of an external IP address automatically to a service upon request

[WARNING]
====
Disabled by default, use of ExternalIP functionality can be a security risk, because in-cluster traffic to an external IP address is directed to that service.
This could allow cluster users to intercept sensitive traffic destined for external resources.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
This feature is supported only in non-cloud deployments.
For cloud deployments, use the load balancer services for automatic deployment of a cloud load balancer to target the endpoints of a service.
====

You can assign an external IP address in the following ways:

Automatic assignment of an external IP::
{product-title} automatically assigns an IP address from the `autoAssignCIDRs` CIDR block to the `spec.externalIPs[]` array when you create a `Service` object with `spec.type=LoadBalancer` set.
In this case, {product-title} implements a non-cloud version of the load balancer service type and assigns IP addresses to the services.
Automatic assignment is disabled by default and must be configured by a cluster administrator as described in the following section.

Manual assignment of an external IP::
{product-title} uses the IP addresses assigned to the `spec.externalIPs[]` array when you create a `Service` object. You cannot specify an IP address that is already in use by another service.

[id="configuration-externalip_{context}"]
== Configuration for ExternalIP

Use of an external IP address in {product-title} is governed by the following fields in the `Network.config.openshift.io` CR named `cluster`:

* `spec.externalIP.autoAssignCIDRs` defines an IP address block used by the load balancer when choosing an external IP address for the service. {product-title} supports only a single IP address block for automatic assignment. This can be simpler than having to manage the port space of a limited number of shared IP addresses when manually assigning ExternalIPs to services. If automatic assignment is enabled, a `Service` object with `spec.type=LoadBalancer` is allocated an external IP address.
* `spec.externalIP.policy` defines the permissible IP address blocks when manually specifying an IP address. {product-title} does not apply policy rules to IP address blocks defined by `spec.externalIP.autoAssignCIDRs`.

If routed correctly, external traffic from the configured external IP address block can reach service endpoints through any TCP or UDP port that the service exposes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As a cluster administrator, you must configure routing to externalIPs on both OpenShiftSDN and OVN-Kubernetes network types. You must also ensure that the IP address block you assign terminates at one or more nodes in your cluster. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#external-ips[*Kubernetes External IPs*].
====

{product-title} supports both the automatic and manual assignment of IP
addresses, and each address is guaranteed to be assigned to a maximum of one
service. This ensures that each service can expose its chosen ports regardless
of the ports exposed by other services.

[NOTE]
====
To use IP address blocks defined by `autoAssignCIDRs` in {product-title}, you must configure the necessary IP address assignment and routing for your host network.
====

The following YAML describes a service with an external IP address configured:

.Example `Service` object with `spec.externalIPs[]` set

[id="restrictions-on-ip-assignment_{context}"]
== Restrictions on the assignment of an external IP address

As a cluster administrator, you can specify IP address blocks to allow and to reject.

Restrictions apply only to users without `cluster-admin` privileges. A cluster administrator can always set the service `spec.externalIPs[]` field to any IP address.

You configure IP address policy with a `policy` object defined by specifying the `spec.ExternalIP.policy` field.
The policy object has the following shape:

[source,json]
----
{
  "policy": {
    "allowedCIDRs": [],
    "rejectedCIDRs": []
  }
}
----

When configuring policy restrictions, the following rules apply:

- If `policy={}` is set, then creating a `Service` object with `spec.ExternalIPs[]` set will fail. This is the default for {product-title}. The behavior when `policy=null` is set is identical.
- If `policy` is set and either `policy.allowedCIDRs[]` or `policy.rejectedCIDRs[]` is set, the following rules apply:

* If `allowedCIDRs[]` and `rejectedCIDRs[]` are both set, then `rejectedCIDRs[]` has precedence over `allowedCIDRs[]`.
* If `allowedCIDRs[]` is set, creating a `Service` object with `spec.ExternalIPs[]` will succeed only if the specified IP addresses are allowed.
* If `rejectedCIDRs[]` is set, creating a `Service` object with `spec.ExternalIPs[]` will succeed only if the specified IP addresses are not rejected.

[id="example-policy-objects_{context}"]
== Example policy objects

The examples that follow demonstrate several different policy configurations.

= ExternalIP address block configuration

The configuration for ExternalIP address blocks is defined by a Network custom resource (CR) named `cluster`. The Network CR is part of the `config.openshift.io` API group.

[IMPORTANT]
====
During cluster installation, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) automatically creates a Network CR named `cluster`.
Creating any other CR objects of this type is not supported.
====

The following YAML describes the ExternalIP configuration:

.Network.config.openshift.io CR named `cluster`
[source,yaml]
----

----
<1> Defines the IP address block in CIDR format that is available for automatic assignment of external IP addresses to a service.
Only a single IP address range is allowed.

<2> Defines restrictions on manual assignment of an IP address to a service.
If no restrictions are defined, specifying the `spec.externalIP` field in a `Service` object is not allowed.
By default, no restrictions are defined.

The following YAML describes the fields for the `policy` stanza:

.Network.config.openshift.io `policy` stanza

= Configure external IP address blocks for your cluster

As a cluster administrator, you can configure the following ExternalIP settings:

- An ExternalIP address block used by {product-title} to automatically populate the `spec.clusterIP` field for a `Service` object.
- A policy object to restrict what IP addresses may be manually assigned to the `spec.clusterIP` array of a `Service` object.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Optional: To display the current external IP configuration, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe networks.config cluster
----

. To edit the configuration, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit networks.config cluster
----

. Modify the ExternalIP configuration, as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  ...
  externalIP: <1>
  ...
----
<1> Specify the configuration for the `externalIP` stanza.

. To confirm the updated ExternalIP configuration, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get networks.config cluster -o go-template='{{.spec.externalIP}}{{"\n"}}'
