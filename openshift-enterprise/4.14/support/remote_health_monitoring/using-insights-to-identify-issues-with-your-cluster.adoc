= About Red Hat Insights Advisor for {product-title}

You can use Insights Advisor to assess and monitor the health of your {product-title} clusters. Whether you are concerned about individual clusters, or with your whole infrastructure, it is important to be aware of your exposure to issues that can affect service availability, fault tolerance, performance, or security.

Insights repeatedly analyzes the data that Insights Operator sends using a database of _recommendations_, which are sets of conditions that can leave your {product-title} clusters at risk. Your data is then uploaded to the Insights Advisor service on Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console where you can perform the following actions:

* See clusters impacted by a specific recommendation.
* Use robust filtering capabilities to refine your results to those recommendations.
* Learn more about individual recommendations, details about the risks they present, and get resolutions tailored to your individual clusters.
* Share results with other stakeholders.

= Understanding Insights Advisor recommendations

Insights Advisor bundles information about various cluster states and component configurations that can negatively affect the service availability, fault tolerance, performance, or security of your clusters. This information set is called a recommendation in Insights Advisor and includes the following information:

* *Name:* A concise description of the recommendation
* *Added:* When the recommendation was published to the Insights Advisor archive
* *Category:* Whether the issue has the potential to negatively affect service availability, fault tolerance, performance, or security
* *Total risk:* A value derived from the _likelihood_ that the condition will negatively affect your infrastructure, and the _impact_ on operations if that were to happen
* *Clusters:* A list of clusters on which a recommendation is detected
* *Description:* A brief synopsis of the issue, including how it affects your clusters
* *Link to associated topics:* More information from Red Hat about the issue

[id="displaying-potential-issues-with-your-cluster_{context}"]
= Displaying potential issues with your cluster

This section describes how to display the Insights report in *Insights Advisor* on {cluster-manager-url}.

Note that Insights repeatedly analyzes your cluster and shows the latest results. These results can change, for example, if you fix an issue or a new issue has been detected.

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster is registered on {cluster-manager-url}.
* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to {cluster-manager-url}.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Advisor* -> *Recommendations* on {cluster-manager-url}.
+
Depending on the result, Insights Advisor displays one of the following:
+
* *No matching recommendations found*, if Insights did not identify any issues.
+
* A list of issues Insights has detected, grouped by risk (low, moderate, important, and critical).
+
* *No clusters yet*, if Insights has not yet analyzed the cluster. The analysis starts shortly after the cluster has been installed, registered, and connected to the internet.

. If any issues are displayed, click the *>* icon in front of the entry for more details.
+
Depending on the issue, the details can also contain a link to more information from Red Hat about the issue.

[id="displaying-all-insights-advisor-recommendations_{context}"]
= Displaying all Insights Advisor recommendations

The Recommendations view, by default, only displays the recommendations that are detected on your clusters. However, you can view all of the recommendations in the advisor archive.

.Prerequisites

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* Your cluster is link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/register[registered] on Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.
* You are logged in to {cluster-manager-url}.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Advisor* -> *Recommendations* on {cluster-manager-url}.
. Click the *X* icons next to the *Clusters Impacted* and *Status* filters.
+
You can now browse through all of the potential recommendations for your cluster.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="disabling-insights-advisor-recommendations_{context}"]
= Disabling Insights Advisor recommendations

You can disable specific recommendations that affect your clusters, so that they no longer appear in your reports. It is possible to disable a recommendation for a single cluster or all of your clusters.

[NOTE]
====
Disabling a recommendation for all of your clusters also applies to any future clusters.
====

.Prerequisites

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* Your cluster is registered on {cluster-manager-url}.
* You are logged in to {cluster-manager-url}.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Advisor* -> *Recommendations* on {cluster-manager-url}.
. Optional: Use the *Clusters Impacted* and *Status* filters as needed.
. Disable an alert by using one of the following methods:
+
* To disable an alert:
.. Click the *Options* menu {kebab} for that alert, and then click *Disable recommendation*.
.. Enter a justification note and click *Save*.
+
* To view the clusters affected by this alert before disabling the alert:
.. Click the name of the recommendation to disable. You are directed to the single recommendation page.
.. Review the list of clusters in the *Affected clusters* section.
.. Click *Actions* -> *Disable recommendation* to disable the alert for all of your clusters.
.. Enter a justification note and click *Save*.

[id="enabling-insights-advisor-recommendations_{context}"]
= Enabling a previously disabled Insights Advisor recommendation

When a recommendation is disabled for all clusters, you no longer see the recommendation in the Insights Advisor. You can change this behavior.

.Prerequisites

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* Your cluster is registered on {cluster-manager-url}.
* You are logged in to {cluster-manager-url}.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Advisor* -> *Recommendations* on {cluster-manager-url}.
. Filter the recommendations to display on the disabled recommendations:
.. From the *Status* drop-down menu, select *Status*.
.. From the *Filter by status* drop-down menu, select *Disabled*.
.. Optional: Clear the *Clusters impacted* filter.
. Locate the recommendation to enable.
. Click the *Options* menu {kebab}, and then click *Enable recommendation*.

[id="displaying-the-insights-status-in-the-web-console_{context}"]
= Displaying the Insights status in the web console

Insights repeatedly analyzes your cluster and you can display the status of identified potential issues of your cluster in the {product-title} web console. This status shows the number of issues in the different categories and, for further details, links to the reports in {cluster-manager-url}.

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster is registered in {cluster-manager-url}.
* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Home* -> *Overview* in the {product-title} web console.

. Click *Insights* on the *Status* card.
+
The pop-up window lists potential issues grouped by risk. Click the individual categories or *View all recommendations in Insights Advisor* to display more details.
