The Insights Operator periodically gathers configuration and component failure status and, by default, reports that data every two hours to Red Hat. This information enables Red Hat to assess configuration and deeper failure data than is reported through Telemetry. Users of {product-title} can display the report in the {insights-advisor-url} service on {hybrid-console}.

[role="_additional-resources"]
.Additional resources

* The Insights Operator is installed and enabled by default. If you need to opt out of remote health reporting, see xref:../../support/remote_health_monitoring/opting-out-of-remote-health-reporting.adoc#opting-out-remote-health-reporting[Opting out of remote health reporting].

= Understanding Insights Operator alerts

The Insights Operator declares alerts through the Prometheus monitoring system to the Alertmanager. You can view these alerts in the Alerting UI in the {product-title} web console by using one of the following methods:

* In the *Administrator* perspective, click *Observe* -> *Alerting*.
* In the *Developer* perspective, click *Observe* -> <project_name> -> *Alerts* tab.

Currently, Insights Operator sends the following alerts when the conditions are met:

.Insights Operator alerts
[options="header"]
|====
|Alert|Description
|`InsightsDisabled`|Insights Operator is disabled.
|`SimpleContentAccessNotAvailable`|Simple content access is not enabled in Red Hat Subscription Management.
|`InsightsRecommendationActive`|Insights has an active recommendation for the cluster.

= Disabling Insights Operator alerts

To prevent the Insights Operator from sending alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance, you edit the `support` secret. If the `support` secret doesn't exist, you must create it when you first add custom configurations. Note that configurations within the `support` secret take precedence over the default settings defined in the `pod.yaml` file.
To prevent the Insights Operator from sending alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance, you edit the `support` secret. Note that this `secret` is created by default. The configurations stored in the support secret take precedence over any default settings specified in the `pod.yaml` file.

.Prerequisites

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as `cluster-admin`.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Workloads* -> *Secrets*.
. On the *Secrets* page, select *All Projects* from the *Project* list, and then set *Show default projects* to on.
. Select the *openshift-config* project from the *Projects* list.
. Search for the *support* secret by using the *Search by name* field.
+
* If the secret exists:
. Click the *Options* menu {kebab}, and then click *Edit Secret*.
. Click *Add Key/Value*.
.. In the *Key* field, enter `disableInsightsAlerts`.
.. In the *Value* field, enter `True`.
+
* If the secret does not exist:
.. Click *Create* -> *Key/value secret*.
... In the *Secret name* field, enter `support`.
... In the *Key* field, enter `disableInsightsAlerts`.
... In the *Value* field, enter `True`.
.. Click *Create*.

After you save the changes, Insights Operator no longer sends alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance.

Insights Operator stores gathered data in an archive located in the `openshift-insights` namespace of your cluster. You can download and review the data that is gathered by the Insights Operator.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Find the name of the running pod for the Insights Operator:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods --namespace=openshift-insights -o custom-columns=:metadata.name --no-headers  --field-selector=status.phase=Running

You can disable the Insights Operator gather operations. Disabling the gather operations gives you the ability to increase privacy for your organization as Insights Operator will no longer gather and send Insights cluster reports to Red Hat. This will disable Insights analysis and recommendations for your cluster without affecting other core functions that require communication with Red Hat such as cluster transfers. You can view a list of attempted gather operations for your cluster from the `/insights-operator/gathers.json` file in your Insights Operator archive. Be aware that some gather operations only occur when certain conditions are met and might not appear in your most recent archive.

== Running an Insights Operator gather operation

You can run Insights Operator data gather operations on demand. The following procedures describe how to run the default list of gather operations using the OpenShift web console or CLI. You can customize the on demand gather function to exclude any gather operations you choose.

If you have previously disabled Insights Operator gather operations in your cluster, this procedure will override those parameters.

= Configuring Insights Operator

You can configure Insights Operator to meet the needs of your organization. The Insights Operator is configured using a combination of the default configurations in the `pod.yaml` file in the Insights Operator `Config` directory and the configurations stored in the `support` secret in the `openshift-config` namespace. The `support` secret does not exist by default and must be created when adding custom configurations for the first time. Configurations in the `support` secret override the defaults set in the `pod.yaml` file.
