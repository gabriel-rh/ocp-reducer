* Access other product documentation.

To identify issues with your cluster, you can use Insights in {cluster-manager-url}. Insights provides details about issues and, if available, information on how to solve a problem.

// TODO: verify that these settings apply for Service Mesh and OpenShift virtualization, etc.
If you have a suggestion for improving this documentation or have found an
error, submit a link:https://issues.redhat.com/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=12332330&summary=Documentation_issue&issuetype=1&components=12367614&priority=10200&versions=12402533[Jira issue] for the most relevant documentation component. Please

. Ensure that the account information presented is as expected, and if not, amend accordingly.

. Check that the autofilled {product-title} Cluster ID is correct. If it is not, manually obtain your cluster ID.
+
* To manually obtain your cluster ID using the {product-title} web console:
.. Navigate to *Home* -> *Overview*.
.. Find the value in the *Cluster ID* field of the *Details* section.
+
* Alternatively, it is possible to open a new support case through the {product-title} web console and have your cluster ID autofilled.

.. The *Cluster ID* value is autofilled.
+
* To obtain your cluster ID using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`), run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion -o jsonpath='{.items[].spec.clusterID}{"\n"}'
----

. Complete the following questions where prompted and then click *Continue*:
+
* Where are you experiencing the behavior? What environment?
* When does the behavior occur? Frequency? Repeatedly? At certain times?
* What information can you provide around time-frames and the business impact?

. Upload relevant diagnostic data files and click *Continue*.
It is recommended to include data gathered using the `oc adm must-gather` command as a starting point, plus any issue specific data that is not collected by that command.
