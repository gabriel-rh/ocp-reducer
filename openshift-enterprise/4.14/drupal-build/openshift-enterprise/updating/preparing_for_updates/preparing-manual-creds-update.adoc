WARNING: This assembly has been moved into a subdirectory for 4.14+. Changes to this assembly for earlier versions should be done in separate PRs based off of their respective version branches. Otherwise, your cherry picks may fail.

To do: Remove this comment once 4.13 docs are EOL.
////

The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) `Upgradable` status for a cluster with manually maintained credentials is `False` by default.

* For minor releases, for example, from 4.12 to 4.13, this status prevents you from updating until you have addressed any updated permissions and annotated the `CloudCredential` resource to indicate that the permissions are updated as needed for the next version. This annotation changes the `Upgradable` status to `True`.

* For z-stream releases, for example, from 4.13.0 to 4.13.1, no permissions are added or changed, so the update is not blocked.

Before updating a cluster with manually maintained credentials, you must accommodate any new or changed credentials in the release image for the version of {product-title} you are updating to.
