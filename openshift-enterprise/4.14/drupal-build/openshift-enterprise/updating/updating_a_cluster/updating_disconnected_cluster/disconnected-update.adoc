WARNING: This assembly has been moved into a subdirectory for 4.14+. Changes to this assembly for earlier versions should be done in separate PRs based off of their respective version branches. Otherwise, your cherry picks may fail.

Use the following procedures to update a cluster in a disconnected environment without access to the OpenShift Update Service.

== Prerequisites

* You must have the `oc` command-line interface (CLI) tool installed.
* You must provision a local container image registry with the container images for your update, as described in xref:mirroring-ocp-image-repository[Mirroring {product-title} images].
* You must have access to the cluster as a user with `admin` privileges.
See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/authentication_and_authorization/#using-rbac[Using RBAC to define and apply permissions].
* You must have a recent link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/backup_and_restore/#backup-etcd[etcd backup] in case your update fails and you must link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/backup_and_restore/#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore your cluster to a previous state].
* You have updated all Operators previously installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to a version that is compatible with your target release. Updating the Operators ensures they have a valid update path when the default OperatorHub catalogs switch from the current minor version to the next during a cluster update. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/operators/#olm-upgrading-operators[Updating installed Operators] for more information on how to check compatibility and, if necessary, update the installed Operators.
* You must ensure that all machine config pools (MCPs) are running and not paused. Nodes associated with a paused MCP are skipped during the update process. You can pause the MCPs if you are performing a canary rollout update strategy.
* If your cluster uses manually maintained credentials, update the cloud provider resources for the new release. For more information, including how to determine if this is a requirement for your cluster, see xref:preparing-manual-creds-update[Preparing to update a cluster with manually maintained credentials].
* If you run an Operator or you have configured any application with the pod disruption budget, you might experience an interruption during the update process. If `minAvailable` is set to 1 in `PodDisruptionBudget`, the nodes are drained to apply pending machine configs which might block the eviction process. If several nodes are rebooted, all the pods might run on only one node, and the `PodDisruptionBudget` field can prevent the node drain.
