{VirtProductName} provides metrics that you can use to monitor the consumption of cluster infrastructure resources, including vCPU, network, storage, and guest memory swapping. You can also use metrics to query live migration status.

Use the {product-title} monitoring dashboard to query virtualization metrics.

[id="prerequisites_{context}"]
== Prerequisites

* To use the vCPU metric, the `schedstats=enable` kernel argument must be applied to the `MachineConfig` object. This kernel argument enables scheduler statistics used for debugging and performance tuning and adds a minor additional load to the scheduler. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/postinstallation_configuration/#nodes-nodes-kernel-arguments_post-install-machine-configuration-tasks[Adding kernel arguments to nodes].

* For guest memory swapping queries to return data, memory swapping must be enabled on the virtual guests.
