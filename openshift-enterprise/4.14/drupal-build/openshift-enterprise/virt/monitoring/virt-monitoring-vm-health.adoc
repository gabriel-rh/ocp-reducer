You can configure virtual machine (VM) health checks by defining readiness and liveness probes in the `VirtualMachine` resource.

== Defining a watchdog

You can define a watchdog to monitor the health of the guest operating system by performing the following steps:

. Configure a watchdog device for the virtual machine (VM).
. Install the watchdog agent on the guest.

The watchdog device monitors the agent and performs one of the following actions if the guest operating system is unresponsive:

* `poweroff`: The VM powers down immediately. If `spec.running` is set to `true` or `spec.runStrategy` is not set to `manual`, then the VM reboots.
* `reset`: The VM reboots in place and the guest operating system cannot react.
+
[NOTE]
====
The reboot time might cause liveness probes to time out. If cluster-level protections detect a failed liveness probe, the VM might be forcibly rescheduled, increasing the reboot time.
====

* `shutdown`: The VM gracefully powers down by stopping all services.

[NOTE]
====
Watchdog is not available for Windows VMs.
