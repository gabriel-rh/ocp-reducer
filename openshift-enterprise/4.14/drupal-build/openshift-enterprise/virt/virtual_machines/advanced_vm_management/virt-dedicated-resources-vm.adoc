include::../../includes/virt-about-dedicated-resources.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Prerequisites

* The link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/scalability_and_performance/#using-cpu-manager-and-topology-manager[CPU Manager]  must be configured on the node. Verify that the node has the `cpumanager = true` label before scheduling virtual machine workloads.

* The virtual machine must be powered off.
