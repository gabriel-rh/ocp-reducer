PXE booting, or network booting, is available in {VirtProductName}.
Network booting allows a computer to boot and load an
operating system or other program without requiring a locally attached
storage device. For example, you can use it to choose your desired OS
image from a PXE server when deploying a new host.

== Prerequisites

* A Linux bridge must be xref:virt-connecting-vm-to-linux-bridge[connected].

* The PXE server must be connected to the same VLAN as the bridge.
