By default, {VirtProductName} is installed with a single, internal pod network.

You can create a Linux bridge network and attach a virtual machine (VM) to the network by performing the following steps:

. xref:virt-creating-linux-bridge-nncp_virt-connecting-vm-to-linux-bridge[Create a Linux bridge node network configuration policy (NNCP)].
. Create a Linux bridge network attachment definition (NAD) by using the xref:virt-creating-linux-bridge-nad-web_virt-connecting-vm-to-linux-bridge[web console] or the xref:virt-creating-linux-bridge-nad-cli_virt-connecting-vm-to-linux-bridge[command line].
. Configure the VM to recognize the NAD by using the xref:virt-vm-creating-nic-web_virt-connecting-vm-to-linux-bridge[web console] or the xref:virt-attaching-vm-secondary-network-cli_virt-connecting-vm-to-linux-bridge[command line].
