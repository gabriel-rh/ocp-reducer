= Configuring log forwarding
:context: configuring-log-forwarding


By default, the {logging} sends container and infrastructure logs to the default internal log store defined in the `ClusterLogging` custom resource. However, it does not send audit logs to the internal store because it does not provide secure storage. If this default configuration meets your needs, you do not need to configure the Cluster Log Forwarder.

[NOTE]
====
To send audit logs to the internal Elasticsearch log store, use the Cluster Log Forwarder as described in xref:cluster-logging-elasticsearch-audit_logging-config-es-store[Forwarding audit logs to the log store].
