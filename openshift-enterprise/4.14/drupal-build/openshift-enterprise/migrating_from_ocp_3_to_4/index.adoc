{product-title} 4 clusters are different from {product-title} 3 clusters. {product-title} 4 clusters contain new technologies and functionality that result in a cluster that is self-managing, flexible, and automated. To learn more about migrating from {product-title} 3 to 4 see xref:about-migrating-from-3-to-4[About migrating from OpenShift Container Platform 3 to 4].

== Planning network considerations
Before migrating from {product-title} 3 to 4, review the xref:planning-migration-3-4[differences between {product-title} 3 and 4] for information about the following areas:

* xref:dns-considerations_planning-considerations-3-4[DNS considerations]
** xref:migration-isolating-dns-domain-of-target-cluster-from-clients_planning-considerations-3-4[Isolating the DNS domain of the target cluster from the clients].
** xref:migration-setting-up-target-cluster-to-accept-source-dns-domain_planning-considerations-3-4[Setting up the target cluster to accept the source DNS domain].

You can migrate stateful application workloads from {product-title} 3 to 4 at the granularity of a namespace. To learn more about MTC see xref:about-mtc-3-4[Understanding MTC].
