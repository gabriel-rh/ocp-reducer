You can use the {run-once-operator} to specify a maximum time limit that run-once pods can be active for. By enabling the run-once duration override on a namespace, all future run-once pods created or updated in that namespace have their `activeDeadlineSeconds` field set to the value specified by the {run-once-operator}.

//[NOTE]
//====
//If both the run-once pod and the {run-once-operator} have their `activeDeadlineSeconds` value set, the lower of the two values is used.
