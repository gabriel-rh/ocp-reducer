= Providing sensitive data to pods by using an external secrets store
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: nodes-pods-secrets-store


Some applications need sensitive information, such as passwords and user names, that you do not want developers to have.

As an alternative to using Kubernetes `Secret` objects to provide sensitive information, you can use an external secrets store to store the sensitive information. You can use the {secrets-store-operator} to integrate with an external secrets store and mount the secret content as a pod volume.

== Mounting secrets from an external secrets store to a CSI volume

After installing the {secrets-store-operator}, you can mount secrets from one of the following external secrets stores to a CSI volume:

* xref:secrets-store-aws_nodes-pods-secrets-store[AWS Secrets Manager]
* xref:secrets-store-aws_nodes-pods-secrets-store-parameter-store[AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store]
* xref:secrets-store-azure_nodes-pods-secrets-store[Azure Key Vault]
