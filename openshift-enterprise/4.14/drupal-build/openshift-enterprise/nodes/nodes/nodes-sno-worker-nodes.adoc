= Adding worker nodes to {sno} clusters
:context: add-workers
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]


{sno-caps} clusters reduce the host prerequisites for deployment to a single host. This is useful for deployments in constrained environments or at the network edge. However, sometimes you need to add additional capacity to your cluster, for example, in telecommunications and network edge scenarios. In these scenarios, you can add worker nodes to the single-node cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Unlike multi-node clusters, by default all ingress traffic is routed to the single control-plane node, even after adding additional worker nodes.
====

There are several ways that you can add worker nodes to a single-node cluster. You can add worker nodes to a cluster manually, using link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/assisted-installer/clusters[{cluster-manager-first}], or by using the Assisted Installer REST API directly.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Adding worker nodes does not expand the cluster control plane, and it does not provide high availability to your cluster. For {sno} clusters, high availability is handled by failing over to another site. It is not recommended to add a large number of worker nodes to a single-node cluster.
====

[NOTE]
====
To add worker nodes, you must have access to the {cluster-manager}. This method is not supported when using the Agent-based installer to install a cluster in a disconnected environment.

== Adding worker nodes using the Assisted Installer API

You can add worker nodes to {sno} clusters using the Assisted Installer REST API. Before you add worker nodes, you must log in to link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/show[{cluster-manager}] and authenticate against the API.
