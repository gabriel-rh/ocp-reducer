:platform: Nutanix


In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can choose one of the following options to install a cluster on your Nutanix instance:

**Using installer-provisioned infrastructure**: Use the procedures in the following sections to use installer-provisioned infrastructure. Installer-provisioned infrastructure is ideal for installing in connected or disconnected network environments. The installer-provisioned infrastructure includes an installation program that provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster.

**Using the Assisted Installer**: The link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform[{ai-full}] hosted at link:http://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com]. The {ai-full} cannot be used in disconnected environments. The {ai-full} does not provision the underlying infrastructure for the cluster, so you must provision the infrastructure before the running the {ai-full}. Installing with the {ai-full} also provides integration with Nutanix, enabling autoscaling. See xref:installing-on-prem-assisted[Installing an on-premise cluster using the {ai-full}] for additional details.

**Using user-provisioned infrastructure**: Complete the relevant steps outlined in the xref:installing-platform-agnostic[Installing a cluster on any platform] documentation.

== Prerequisites

* You have reviewed details about the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* The installation program requires access to port 9440 on Prism Central and Prism Element. You verified that port 9440 is accessible.
* If you use a firewall, you have met these prerequisites:
** You confirmed that port 9440 is accessible. Control plane nodes must be able to reach Prism Central and Prism Element on port 9440 for the installation to succeed.
** You configured the firewall to xref:configuring-firewall[grant access] to the sites that {product-title} requires. This includes the use of Telemetry.
* If your Nutanix environment is using the default self-signed SSL certificate, replace it with a certificate that is signed by a CA. The installation program requires a valid CA-signed certificate to access to the Prism Central API. For more information about replacing the self-signed certificate, see the  https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Nutanix-Security-Guide-v6_1:mul-security-ssl-certificate-pc-t.html[Nutanix AOS Security Guide].
+
If your Nutanix environment uses an internal CA to issue certificates, you must configure a cluster-wide proxy as part of the installation process. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/networking/#configuring-a-custom-pki[Configuring a custom PKI].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use 2048-bit certificates. The installation fails if you use 4096-bit certificates with Prism Central 2022.x.
