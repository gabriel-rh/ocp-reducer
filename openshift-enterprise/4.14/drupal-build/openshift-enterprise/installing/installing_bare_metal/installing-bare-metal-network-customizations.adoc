= Installing a user-provisioned bare metal cluster with network customizations
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: installing-bare-metal-network-customizations


In {product-title} {product-version}, you can install a cluster on bare
metal infrastructure that you provision with customized network configuration
options. By customizing your network configuration, your cluster can coexist
with existing IP address allocations in your environment and integrate with
existing MTU and VXLAN configurations.

When you customize {product-title} networking, you must set most of the network configuration parameters during installation. You can modify only `kubeProxy` network configuration parameters in a running
cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* If you use a firewall and plan to use the Telemetry service, you xref:configuring-firewall[configured the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

== Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure

For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all
of the required machines.

This section describes the requirements for deploying {product-title} on user-provisioned infrastructure.
