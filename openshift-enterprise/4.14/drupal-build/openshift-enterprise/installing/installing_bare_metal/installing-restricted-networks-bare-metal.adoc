= Installing a user-provisioned bare metal cluster on a restricted network
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: installing-restricted-networks-bare-metal


In {product-title} {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
bare metal infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While you might be able to follow this procedure to deploy a cluster on
virtualized or cloud environments, you must be aware of additional
considerations for non-bare metal platforms. Review the information in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4207611[guidelines for deploying {product-title} on non-tested platforms]
before you attempt to install an {product-title} cluster in such an environment.
====

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:installing-mirroring-installation-images[created a registry on your mirror host] and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror host, you can use that computer to complete all installation steps.
====
* You provisioned link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/storage/#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, your storage must provide ReadWriteMany access modes.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use the Telemetry service, you xref:configuring-firewall[configured the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
+
[NOTE]
====
Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.
