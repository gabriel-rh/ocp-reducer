In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a customized cluster on
{rh-openstack-first}. To customize the installation, modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` before you install the cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You verified that {product-title} {product-version} is compatible with your {rh-openstack} version by using the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#supported-platforms-for-openshift-clusters_architecture-installation[Supported platforms for OpenShift clusters] section. You can also compare platform support across different versions by viewing the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4679401[{product-title} on {rh-openstack} support matrix].
* You have a storage service installed in {rh-openstack}, such as block storage (Cinder) or object storage (Swift). Object storage is the recommended storage technology for {product-title} registry cluster deployment. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/scalability_and_performance/#optimizing-storage[Optimizing storage].
* You understand performance and scalability practices for cluster scaling, control plane sizing, and etcd. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/scalability_and_performance/#recommended-host-practices[Recommended practices for scaling the cluster].
* You have the metadata service enabled in {rh-openstack}.

[TIP]
====
You can add additional networks, including provider networks, to the `platform.openstack.additionalNetworkIDs` list.

After you deploy your cluster, you can attach pods to additional networks. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/networking/#understanding-multiple-networks[Understanding multiple networks].
