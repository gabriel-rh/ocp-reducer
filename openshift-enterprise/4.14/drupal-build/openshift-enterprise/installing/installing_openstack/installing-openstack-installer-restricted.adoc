In {product-title} {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
{rh-openstack-first} in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You verified that {product-title} {product-version} is compatible with your {rh-openstack} version by using the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#supported-platforms-for-openshift-clusters_architecture-installation[Supported platforms for OpenShift clusters] section. You can also compare platform support across different versions by viewing the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4679401[{product-title} on {rh-openstack} support matrix].
* You xref:installing-mirroring-installation-images[created a registry on your mirror host] and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror host, you can use that computer to complete all installation steps.
====
* You understand performance and scalability practices for cluster scaling, control plane sizing, and etcd. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/scalability_and_performance/#recommended-host-practices[Recommended practices for scaling the cluster].
* You have the metadata service enabled in {rh-openstack}.
