:context: installing-alibaba-vpc


In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster into an existing Alibaba Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Alibaba Cloud Services. The installation program provisions the required infrastructure, which can then be customized. To customize the VPC installation, modify the parameters in the 'install-config.yaml' file before you install the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The scope of the {product-title} installation configurations is intentionally narrow. It is designed for simplicity and ensured success. You can complete many more {product-title} configuration tasks after an installation completes.
