:context: installing-ibm-cloud-restricted


In {product-title} {product-version}, you can install a cluster in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content that is accessible to an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on {ibm-cloud-name}.

[id="prerequisites_installing-ibm-cloud-restricted"]
== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You xref:installing-ibm-cloud-account[configured an IBM Cloud account] to host the cluster.
* You have a container image registry that is accessible to the internet and your restricted network. The container image registry should mirror the contents of the {product-registry} and contain the installation media. For more information, see xref:installing-mirroring-disconnected[Mirroring images for a disconnected installation using the oc-mirror plugin].
* You have an existing VPC on {ibm-cloud-name} that meets the following requirements:
** The VPC contains the mirror registry or has firewall rules or a peering connection to access the mirror registry that is hosted elsewhere.
** The VPC can access {ibm-cloud-name} service endpoints using a public endpoint. If network restrictions limit access to public service endpoints, evaluate those services for alternate endpoints that might be available. For more information see xref:access-to-ibm-service-endpoints_installing-ibm-cloud-restricted[Access to IBM service endpoints].

+
You cannot use the VPC that the installation program provisions by default.
* If you plan on configuring endpoint gateways to use {ibm-cloud-name} Virtual Private Endpoints, consider the following requirements:
** Endpoint gateway support is currently limited to the `us-east` and `us-south` regions.
** The VPC must allow traffic to and from the endpoint gateways. You can use the VPCâ€™s default security group, or a new security group, to allow traffic on port 443. For more information, see xref:installation-ibm-cloud-configure-vpc-for-endpoint-gateways_installing-ibm-cloud-restricted[Allowing endpoint gateway traffic].
* If you use a firewall, you xref:configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* You configured the `ccoctl` utility before you installed the cluster. For more information, see xref:configuring-iam-ibm-cloud[Configuring IAM for IBM Cloud VPC].
