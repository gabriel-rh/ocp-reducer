In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a three-node cluster on VMware vSphere. A three-node cluster consists of three control plane machines, which also act as compute machines. This type of cluster provides a smaller, more resource efficient cluster, for cluster administrators and developers to use for testing, development, and production.

You can install a three-node cluster using either installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure.
