You can remove a cluster that you deployed in your VMware vSphere instance by using installer-provisioned infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
When you run the `openshift-install destroy cluster` command to uninstall {product-title}, vSphere volumes are not automatically deleted. The cluster administrator must manually find the vSphere volumes and delete them.
