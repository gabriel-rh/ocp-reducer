:context: installing-restricted-networks-installer-provisioned-vsphere


In {product-title} {product-version}, you can install a cluster on VMware vSphere infrastructure in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content.

[id="prerequisites_installing-restricted-networks-installer-provisioned-vsphere"]
== Prerequisites

* You have completed the tasks in xref:ipi-vsphere-preparing-to-install[Preparing to install a cluster using installer-provisioned infrastructure].
* You reviewed your VMware platform licenses. Red{nbsp}Hat does not place any restrictions on your VMware licenses, but some VMware infrastructure components require licensing.
* You reviewed details about the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:installing-mirroring-installation-images[created a registry on your mirror host] and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror host, you can use that computer to complete all installation steps.
====
* You provisioned link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/storage/#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, your storage must provide the ReadWriteMany access mode.
* The {product-title} installer requires access to port 443 on the vCenter and ESXi hosts. You verified that port 443 is accessible.
* If you use a firewall, you confirmed with the administrator that port 443 is accessible. Control plane nodes must be able to reach vCenter and ESXi hosts on port 443 for the installation to succeed.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use the Telemetry service, you xref:configuring-firewall[configured the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

== Creating registry storage

After you install the cluster, you must create storage for the Registry Operator.
