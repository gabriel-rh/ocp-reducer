In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on your
VMware vSphere instance by using installer-provisioned infrastructure.

include::../../includes/vcenter-support.adoc[]

== Prerequisites

* You have completed the tasks in xref:ipi-vsphere-preparing-to-install[Preparing to install a cluster using installer-provisioned infrastructure].
* You reviewed your VMware platform licenses. Red{nbsp}Hat does not place any restrictions on your VMware licenses, but some VMware infrastructure components require licensing.
* You reviewed details about the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You provisioned link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/storage/#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, your storage must provide
`ReadWriteMany` access modes.
* The {product-title} installer requires access to port 443 on the vCenter and ESXi hosts. You verified that port 443 is accessible.
* If you use a firewall, you confirmed with the administrator that port 443 is accessible. Control plane nodes must be able to reach vCenter and ESXi hosts on port 443 for the installation to succeed.
* If you use a firewall, you xref:configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
