= Installing a cluster on AWS in a restricted network

:context: installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned


In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content on an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

[id="prerequisites_installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned"]
== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:installation-about-mirror-registry_installing-mirroring-installation-images[mirrored the images for a disconnected installation] to your registry and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror host, you can use that computer to complete all installation steps.
====
* You have an existing VPC in AWS. When installing to a restricted network using installer-provisioned infrastructure, you cannot use the installer-provisioned VPC. You must use a user-provisioned VPC that satisfies one of the following requirements:
** Contains the mirror registry
** Has firewall rules or a peering connection to access the mirror registry hosted elsewhere
* You xref:installing-aws-account[configured an AWS account] to host the cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have an AWS profile stored on your computer, it must not use a temporary session token that you generated while using a multi-factor authentication device. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must use key-based, long-term credentials. To generate appropriate keys, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Managing Access Keys for IAM Users] in the AWS documentation. You can supply the keys when you run the installation program.
====
* You downloaded the AWS CLI and installed it on your computer. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-bundle.html[Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer (Linux, macOS, or Unix)] in the AWS documentation.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use the Telemetry service, you xref:configuring-firewall[configured the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

[NOTE]

If you are configuring a proxy, be sure to also review this site list.

== Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project

By default, administrator secrets are stored in the `kube-system` project. If you configured the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file to `Manual`, you must use one of the following alternatives:

* To manage long-term cloud credentials manually, follow the procedure in xref:manually-create-iam_installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned[Manually creating long-term credentials].

* To implement short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster for individual components, follow the procedures in xref:installing-aws-with-short-term-creds_installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned[Configuring an AWS cluster to use short-term credentials].

=== Configuring an AWS cluster to use short-term credentials

To install a cluster that is configured to use the AWS Security Token Service (STS), you must configure the CCO utility and create the required AWS resources for your cluster.

//Task part 2: Creating the required AWS resources
[id="sts-mode-create-aws-resources-ccoctl_{context}"]
==== Creating AWS resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

You have the following options when creating AWS resources:

* You can use the `ccoctl aws create-all` command to create the AWS resources automatically. This is the quickest way to create the resources. See xref:cco-ccoctl-creating-at-once_installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned[Creating AWS resources with a single command].

* If you need to review the JSON files that the `ccoctl` tool creates before modifying AWS resources, or if the process the `ccoctl` tool uses to create AWS resources automatically does not meet the requirements of your organization, you can create the AWS resources individually. See xref:cco-ccoctl-creating-individually_installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned[Creating AWS resources individually].
