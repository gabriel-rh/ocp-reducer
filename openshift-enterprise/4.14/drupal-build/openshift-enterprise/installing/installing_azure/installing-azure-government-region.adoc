:context: installing-azure-government-region


In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
Microsoft Azure into a government region. To configure the government region,
you modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before you install the
cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:installing-azure-account[configured an Azure account] to host the cluster and determined the tested and validated government region to deploy the cluster to.
* If you use a firewall, you xref:configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* If the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the `kube-system` namespace, you can xref:manually-create-iam_installing-azure-customizations[manually create and maintain long-term credentials].
* If you use customer-managed encryption keys, you xref:enabling-user-managed-encryption-azure[prepared your Azure environment for encryption].
