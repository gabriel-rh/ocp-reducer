:context: installing-restricted-networks-azure-installer-provisioned


In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on Microsoft Azure in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content on an existing Azure Virtual Network (VNet).

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can install an {product-title} cluster by using mirrored installation release content, but your cluster requires internet access to use the Azure APIs.

[id="prerequisites_installing-restricted-networks-azure-installer-provisioned"]
== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:installing-azure-account[configured an Azure account] to host the cluster and determined the tested and validated region to deploy the cluster.
* You xref:installation-about-mirror-registry_installing-mirroring-installation-images[mirrored the images for a disconnected installation] to your registry and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror host, you can use that computer to complete all installation steps.
====
* You have an existing VNet in Azure. While installing a cluster in a restricted network that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure, you cannot use the installer-provisioned VNet. You must use a user-provisioned VNet that satisfies one of the following requirements:
** The VNet contains the mirror registry
** The VNet has firewall rules or a peering connection to access the mirror registry hosted elsewhere
* If you use a firewall, you xref:configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* If you use customer-managed encryption keys, you xref:enabling-user-managed-encryption-azure[prepared your Azure environment for encryption].

== Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project

By default, administrator secrets are stored in the `kube-system` project. If you configured the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file to `Manual`, you must use one of the following alternatives:

* To manage long-term cloud credentials manually, follow the procedure in xref:manually-create-iam_installing-restricted-networks-azure-installer-provisioned[Manually creating long-term credentials].

* To implement short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster for individual components, follow the procedures in xref:installing-azure-with-short-term-creds_installing-restricted-networks-azure-installer-provisioned[Configuring an Azure cluster to use short-term credentials].

//Manually creating long-term credentials

=== Configuring an Azure cluster to use short-term credentials

To install a cluster that uses Azure AD Workload Identity, you must configure the Cloud Credential Operator utility and create the required Azure resources for your cluster.
