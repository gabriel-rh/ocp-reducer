= Installing a cluster on Azure using ARM templates
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: installing-azure-user-infra
:platform: Azure


In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on Microsoft Azure by using infrastructure that you provide.

Several link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview[Azure Resource Manager] (ARM) templates are provided to assist in completing these steps or to help model your own.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the cloud provider and the installation process of {product-title}. Several ARM templates are provided to assist in completing these steps or to help model your own. You are also free to create the required resources through other methods; the templates are just an example.
====

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:installing-azure-account[configured an Azure account] to host the cluster.
* You downloaded the Azure CLI and installed it on your computer. See link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest[Install the Azure CLI] in the Azure documentation. The documentation below was last tested using version `2.38.0` of the Azure CLI. Azure CLI commands might perform differently based on the version you use.
* If the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the `kube-system` namespace, see xref:installing-azure-manual-modes_installing-azure-customizations[Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project].
* If you use a firewall and plan to use the Telemetry service, you xref:configuring-firewall[configured the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

== Configuring your Azure project

Before you can install {product-title}, you must configure an Azure project to host it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All Azure resources that are available through public endpoints are subject to resource name restrictions, and you cannot create resources that use certain terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-reserved-resource-name[Resolve reserved resource name errors] in the Azure documentation.
