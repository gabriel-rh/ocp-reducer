In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a customized
cluster on infrastructure that the installation program provisions on
Microsoft Azure. To customize the installation, you modify
parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before you install the cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:installing-azure-account[configured an Azure account] to host the cluster and determined the tested and validated region to deploy the cluster to.
* If you use a firewall, you xref:configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* If you use customer-managed encryption keys, you xref:enabling-user-managed-encryption-azure[prepared your Azure environment for encryption].

== Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project

By default, administrator secrets are stored in the `kube-system` project. If you configured the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file to `Manual`, you must use one of the following alternatives:

* To manage long-term cloud credentials manually, follow the procedure in xref:manually-create-iam_installing-azure-customizations[Manually creating long-term credentials].

* To implement short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster for individual components, follow the procedures in xref:installing-azure-with-short-term-creds_installing-azure-customizations[Configuring an Azure cluster to use short-term credentials].

//Manually creating long-term credentials

=== Configuring an Azure cluster to use short-term credentials

To install a cluster that uses Azure AD Workload Identity, you must configure the Cloud Credential Operator utility and create the required Azure resources for your cluster.
