= Installing a cluster on {ibm-power-server-title} into an existing VPC
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: installing-ibm-powervs-vpc


In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster into an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on {ibm-cloud-name}. The installation program provisions the rest of the required infrastructure, which you can then further customize. To customize the installation, you modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before you install the cluster.
