== Requirements for installing {product-title} on {ibm-power-server-title}

Before installing {product-title} on {ibm-power-server-name} you must create a service account and configure an {ibm-cloud-name} account. See xref:installing-ibm-cloud-account-power-vs[Configuring an {ibm-cloud-name} account] for details about creating an account, configuring DNS and supported {ibm-power-server-name} regions.

You must manually manage your cloud credentials when installing a cluster to {ibm-power-server-name}. Do this by configuring the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) for manual mode before you install the cluster.

== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on {ibm-power-server-title}

You can install {product-title} on {ibm-power-server-name} using installer-provisioned infrastructure. This process involves using an installation program to provision the underlying infrastructure for your cluster. Installing {product-title} on {ibm-power-server-name} using user-provisioned infrastructure is not supported at this time.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#installation-process_architecture-installation[Installation process] for more information about installer-provisioned installation processes.

=== Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on {ibm-power-server-name} infrastructure that is provisioned by the {product-title} installation program by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:installing-ibm-power-vs-customizations[Installing a customized cluster on {ibm-power-server-name}]**: You can install a customized cluster on {ibm-power-server-name} infrastructure that the installation program provisions. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/postinstallation_configuration/#post-install-cluster-tasks[post-installation].

* **xref:installing-ibm-powervs-vpc[Installing a cluster on {ibm-power-server-name} into an existing VPC]**: You can install {product-title} on {ibm-power-server-name} into an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). You can use this installation method if you have constraints set by the guidelines of your company, such as limits when creating new accounts or infrastructure.

* **xref:installing-ibm-power-vs-private-cluster[Installing a private cluster on {ibm-power-server-name}]**: You can install a private cluster on {ibm-power-server-name}. You can use this method to deploy {product-title} on an internal network that is not visible to the internet.

* **xref:installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power-vs[Installing a cluster on {ibm-power-server-name} in a restricted network]**: You can install {product-title} on {ibm-power-server-name} on installer-provisioned infrastructure by using an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components.
