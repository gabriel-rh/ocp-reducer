= Installing a cluster on {ibm-power-server-title} in a restricted network
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power-vs


In {product-title} {product-version}, you can install a cluster on {ibm-cloud-name} in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content on an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on {ibm-cloud-name}.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:installing-ibm-cloud-account-power-vs[configured an {ibm-cloud-name} account] to host the cluster.
* You xref:installation-about-mirror-registry_installing-mirroring-installation-images[mirrored the images for a disconnected installation] to your registry and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror host, you can use that computer to complete all installation steps.
====
* You have an existing VPC in {ibm-cloud-name}. When installing a cluster in a restricted network, you cannot use the installer-provisioned VPC. You must use a user-provisioned VPC that satisfies one of the following requirements:
** Contains the mirror registry
** Has firewall rules or a peering connection to access the mirror registry hosted elsewhere
* If you use a firewall, you xref:configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* You configured the `ccoctl` utility before you installed the cluster. For more information, see xref:cco-ccoctl-configuring_preparing-to-install-on-ibm-power-vs[Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility].
