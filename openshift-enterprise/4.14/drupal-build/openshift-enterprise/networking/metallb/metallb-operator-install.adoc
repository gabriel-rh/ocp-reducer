:context: metallb-operator-install


As a cluster administrator, you can add the MetallB Operator so that the Operator can manage the lifecycle for an instance of MetalLB on your cluster.

MetalLB and IP failover are incompatible. If you configured IP failover for your cluster, perform the steps to xref:nw-ipfailover-remove_configuring-ipfailover[remove IP failover] before you install the Operator.
