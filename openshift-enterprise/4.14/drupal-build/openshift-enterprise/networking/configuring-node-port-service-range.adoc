As a cluster administrator, you can expand the available node port range. If your cluster uses of a large number of node ports, you might need to increase the number of available ports.

The default port range is `30000-32767`. You can never reduce the port range, even if you first expand it beyond the default range.

== Prerequisites

- Your cluster infrastructure must allow access to the ports that you specify within the expanded range. For example, if you expand the node port range to `30000-32900`, the inclusive port range of `32768-32900` must be allowed by your firewall or packet filtering configuration.
