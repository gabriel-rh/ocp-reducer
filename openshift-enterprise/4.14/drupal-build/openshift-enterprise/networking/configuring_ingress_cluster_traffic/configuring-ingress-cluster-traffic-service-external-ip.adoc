:context: configuring-ingress-cluster-traffic-service-external-ip


You can attach an external IP address to a service so that it is available to traffic outside the cluster.
This is generally useful only for a cluster installed on bare metal hardware.
The external network infrastructure must be configured correctly to route traffic to the service.
