The containerized Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) application is supported on {product-title}. You can use Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) network hardware with the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) and with remote direct memory access (RDMA).

For information about supported devices, see xref:supported-devices_about-sriov[Supported devices].
