[id="configuring-hardware-offloading-prerequisites"]
== Prerequisites

* Your cluster has at least one bare metal machine with a network interface controller that is supported for hardware offloading.
* You xref:installing-sr-iov-operator_installing-sriov-operator[installed the SR-IOV Network Operator].
* Your cluster uses the xref:about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes network plugin].
* In your xref:gatewayConfig-object_cluster-network-operator[OVN-Kubernetes network plugin configuration], the `gatewayConfig.routingViaHost` field is set to `false`.
