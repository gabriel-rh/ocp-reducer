= Azure Disk CSI Driver Operator
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: persistent-storage-csi-azure


== Overview

{product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Microsoft Azure Disk Storage.

Familiarity with xref:understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is recommended when working with a CSI Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to Azure Disk storage assets, {product-title} installs the Azure Disk CSI Driver Operator and the Azure Disk CSI driver by default in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace.

* The _Azure Disk CSI Driver Operator_ provides a storage class named `managed-csi` that you can use to create persistent volume claims (PVCs). The Azure Disk CSI Driver Operator supports dynamic volume provisioning by allowing storage volumes to be created on-demand, eliminating the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage. You can disable this default storage class if desired (see xref:persistent-storage-csi-sc-manage[Managing the default storage class]).

* The _Azure Disk CSI driver_ enables you to create and mount Azure Disk PVs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} defaults to using the CSI plugin to provision Azure Disk storage.

[NOTE]
====
If the OS (root) disk is encrypted, and there is no encrypted key defined in the storage class, Azure Disk CSI driver uses the OS disk encryption key by default to encrypt provisioned storage volumes.
