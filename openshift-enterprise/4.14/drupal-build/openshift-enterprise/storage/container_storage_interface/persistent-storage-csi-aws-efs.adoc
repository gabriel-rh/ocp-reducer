== Overview

{product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for AWS Elastic File Service (EFS).

Familiarity with xref:understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is recommended when working with a CSI Operator and driver.

After installing the AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator, {product-title} installs the AWS EFS CSI Operator and the AWS EFS CSI driver by default in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace. This allows the AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator to create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to AWS EFS assets.

* The _AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator_, after being installed, does not create a storage class by default to use to create persistent volume claims (PVCs). However, you can manually create the AWS EFS `StorageClass`.
The AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator supports dynamic volume provisioning by allowing storage volumes to be created on-demand.
This eliminates the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage.

* The _AWS EFS CSI driver_ enables you to create and mount AWS EFS PVs.

[NOTE]
====
AWS EFS only supports regional volumes, not zonal volumes.
