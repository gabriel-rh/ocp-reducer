[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, you can use the Shared Resource CSI Driver in {product-title} to provision inline ephemeral volumes that contain the contents of `Secret` or `ConfigMap` objects. This way, pods and other Kubernetes types that expose volume mounts, and {product-title} Builds can securely use the contents of those objects across potentially any namespace in the cluster. To accomplish this, there are currently two types of shared resources: a `SharedSecret` custom resource for `Secret` objects, and a `SharedConfigMap` custom resource for `ConfigMap` objects.

// The Shared Resource CSI Driver in {product-title}, as opposed to the driver for upstream Kubernetes...
