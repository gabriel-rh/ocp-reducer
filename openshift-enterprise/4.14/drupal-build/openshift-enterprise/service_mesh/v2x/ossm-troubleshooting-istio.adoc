== Troubleshooting the control plane

The Service Mesh _control plane_ is composed of Istiod, which consolidates several previous control plane components (Citadel, Galley, Pilot) into a single binary. Deploying the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` also creates the other components that make up {SMProductName} as described in the xref:ossm-architecture_ossm-architecture[architecture] topic.

== Troubleshooting the data plane

The _data plane_ is a set of intelligent proxies that intercept and control all inbound and outbound network communications between services in the service mesh.

{SMProductName} relies on a proxy sidecar within the applicationâ€™s pod to provide service mesh capabilities to the application.

include::../includes/ossm-troubleshooting-injection.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

For more information about sidecar injection, see xref:ossm-automatic-sidecar-injection_deploying-applications-ossm[Enabling automatic injection]
