=  Multiple regions and zones configuration for a cluster on vSphere
include::includes/common-attributes.adoc[]


As an administrator, you can specify multiple regions and zones for your {product-title} cluster that runs on a VMware vSphere instance. This configuration reduces the risk of a hardware failure or network outage causing your cluster to fail.

A failure domain configuration lists parameters that create a topology. The following list states some of these parameters:

* `computeCluster`

* `datacenter`

* `datastore`

* `networks`

* `resourcePool`

After you define multiple regions and zones for your {product-title} cluster, you can create or migrate nodes to another failure domain.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you want to migrate pre-existing {product-title} cluster compute nodes to a failure domain, you must define a new compute machine set for the compute node. This new machine set can scale up a compute node according to the topology of the failure domain, and scale down the pre-existing compute node.

The cloud provider adds `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` and `topology.kubernetes.io/region` labels to any compute node provisioned by a machine set resource.
