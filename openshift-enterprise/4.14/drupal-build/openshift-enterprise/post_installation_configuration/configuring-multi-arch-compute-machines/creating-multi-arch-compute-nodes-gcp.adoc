= Creating a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on GCP
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]


To create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you must first create a single-architecture GCP installer-provisioned cluster with the multi-architecture installer binary. For more information on AWS installations, refer to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/installing/#installing-a-cluster-on-gcp-with-customizations[Installing a cluster on GCP with customizations]. You can then add ARM64 compute machines sets to your GCP cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Secure booting is currently not supported on ARM64 machines for GCP
