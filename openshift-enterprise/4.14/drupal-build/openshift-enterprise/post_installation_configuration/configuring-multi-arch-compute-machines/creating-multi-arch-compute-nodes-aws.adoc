= Creating a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on AWS
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]


To create an AWS cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you must first create a single-architecture AWS installer-provisioned cluster with the multi-architecture installer binary. For more information on AWS installations, refer to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/installing/#installing-a-cluster-on-aws-with-customizations[Installing a cluster on AWS with customizations]. You can then add a ARM64 compute machine set to your AWS cluster.
