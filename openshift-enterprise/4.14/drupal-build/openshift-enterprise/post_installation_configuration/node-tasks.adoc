== Adding {op-system} compute machines to an {product-title} cluster

You can add more {op-system-first} compute machines to your {product-title} cluster on bare metal.

Before you add more compute machines to a cluster that you installed on bare metal infrastructure, you must create {op-system} machines for it to use. You can either use an ISO image or network PXE booting to create the machines.

//Prerequisites also in adding-bare-metal-compute-user-infra.adoc
=== Prerequisites

* You installed a cluster on bare metal.
* You have installation media and {op-system-first} images that you used to create your cluster. If you do not have these files, you must obtain them by following the instructions in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/installing/#installing-bare-metal[installation procedure].
