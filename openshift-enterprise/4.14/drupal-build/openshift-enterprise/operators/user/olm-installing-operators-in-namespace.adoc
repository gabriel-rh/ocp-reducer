== Prerequisites

* A cluster administrator must add certain permissions to your {product-title} user account to allow self-service Operator installation to a namespace. See xref:olm-creating-policy[Allowing non-cluster administrators to install Operators] for details.

* Ensure that you have downloaded the {cluster-manager-url-pull} as shown in _Obtaining the installation program_ in the installation documentation for your platform.
