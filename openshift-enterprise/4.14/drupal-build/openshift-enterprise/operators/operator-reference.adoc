This reference guide indexes the _cluster Operators_ shipped by Red Hat that serve as the architectural foundation for {product-title}. Cluster Operators are installed by default, unless otherwise noted, and are managed by the Cluster Version Operator (CVO). For more details on the control plane architecture, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#operators-overview_control-plane[Operators in {product-title}].

Cluster administrators can view cluster Operators in the {product-title} web console from the *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings* page.

[NOTE]
====
Cluster Operators are not managed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and OperatorHub. OLM and OperatorHub are part of the link:https://operatorframework.io/[Operator Framework] used in {product-title} for installing and running optional link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/architecture/#olm-operators_control-plane[add-on Operators].
====

Some of the following cluster Operators can be disabled prior to installation. For more information see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/installing/#cluster-capabilities[cluster capabilities].
