= Configuring Operator projects for multi-platform support
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: osdk-multi-arch


Operator projects that support multiple architectures and operating systems, or _platforms_, can run on more Kubernetes and {product-title} clusters than Operator projects that support only a single platform. Example architectures include `amd64`, `arm64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x`. Example operating systems include Linux and Windows.

Perform the following actions to ensure your Operator project can run on multiple {product-title} platforms:

* Build a manifest list that specifies the platforms that your Operator supports.
* Set your Operator's node affinity to support multi-architecture compute machines.
