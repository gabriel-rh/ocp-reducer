// This assembly is not included in the OSD and ROSA docs, because it is Tech Preview. However, once Java-based Operator SDK is GA, this assembly will still need to be excluded from OSD and ROSA if it continues to require cluster-admin permissions.


To demonstrate the basics of setting up and running a Java-based Operator using tools and libraries provided by the Operator SDK, Operator developers can build an example Java-based Operator for Memcached, a distributed key-value store, and deploy it to a cluster.
