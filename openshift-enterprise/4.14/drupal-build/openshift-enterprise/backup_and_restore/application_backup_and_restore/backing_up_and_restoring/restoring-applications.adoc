You restore application backups by creating a `Restore` custom resource (CR). See xref:oadp-creating-restore-cr_restoring-applications[Creating a Restore CR].

You can create restore hooks to run commands in a container in a pod by editing the `Restore` CR. See xref:oadp-creating-restore-hooks_restoring-applications[Creating restore hooks].
