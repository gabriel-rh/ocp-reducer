:context: graceful-restart-cluster


This document describes the process to restart your cluster after a graceful shutdown.

Even though the cluster is expected to be functional after the restart, the cluster might not recover due to unexpected conditions, for example:

* etcd data corruption during shutdown
* Node failure due to hardware
* Network connectivity issues

If your cluster fails to recover, follow the steps to xref:dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore to a previous cluster state].

== Prerequisites

* You have xref:graceful-shutdown-cluster[gracefully shut down your cluster].

* See xref:dr-restoring-cluster-state[Restoring to a previous cluster state] for how to use an etcd backup to restore if your cluster failed to recover after restarting.
