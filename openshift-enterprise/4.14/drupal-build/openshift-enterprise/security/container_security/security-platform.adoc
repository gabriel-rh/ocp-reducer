= Securing the container platform
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: security-platform


{product-title} and Kubernetes APIs are key to automating container management at scale. APIs are used to:

* Validate and configure the data for pods, services, and replication controllers.
* Perform project validation on incoming requests and invoke triggers on other
major system components.

Security-related features in {product-title} that are based on Kubernetes include:

* Multitenancy, which combines Role-Based Access Controls and network policies
to isolate containers at multiple levels.
* Admission plugins, which form boundaries between an API and those
making requests to the API.

{product-title} uses Operators to automate and simplify the management of
Kubernetes-level security features.
