= Recommended {sno} cluster configuration for vDU application workloads

:context: sno-configure-for-vdu


Use the following reference information to understand the {sno} configurations required to deploy virtual distributed unit (vDU) applications in the cluster. Configurations include cluster optimizations for high performance workloads, enabling workload partitioning, and minimizing the number of reboots required postinstallation.

== Recommended cluster install manifests

The ZTP pipeline applies the following custom resources (CRs) during cluster installation. These configuration CRs ensure that the cluster meets the feature and performance requirements necessary for running a vDU application.

[NOTE]
====
When using the {ztp} plugin and `SiteConfig` CRs for cluster deployment, the following `MachineConfig` CRs are included by default.
====

Use the `SiteConfig` `extraManifests` filter to alter the CRs that are included by default. For more information, see xref:ztp-advanced-install-ztp[Advanced managed cluster configuration with SiteConfig CRs].

== Recommended postinstallation cluster configurations

When the cluster installation is complete, the ZTP pipeline applies the following custom resources (CRs) that are required to run DU workloads.

[NOTE]
====
In {ztp} v4.10 and earlier, you configure UEFI secure boot with a `MachineConfig` CR. This is no longer required in {ztp} v4.11 and later. In v4.11, you configure UEFI secure boot for {sno} clusters by updating the `spec.clusters.nodes.bootMode` field in the `SiteConfig` CR that you use to install the cluster. For more information, see xref:ztp-deploying-a-site_ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites[Deploying a managed cluster with SiteConfig and {ztp}].
