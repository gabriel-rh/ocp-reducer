To use {rh-rhacm} in a disconnected environment, create a mirror registry that mirrors the {product-title} release images and Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) catalog that contains the required Operator images. OLM manages, installs, and upgrades Operators and their dependencies in the cluster. You can also use a disconnected mirror host to serve the {op-system} ISO and RootFS disk images that are used to provision the bare-metal hosts.
