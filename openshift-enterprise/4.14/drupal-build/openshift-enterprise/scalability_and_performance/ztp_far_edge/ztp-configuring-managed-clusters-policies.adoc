= Configuring managed clusters with policies and PolicyGenTemplate resources

:context: ztp-configuring-managed-clusters-policies


Applied policy custom resources (CRs) configure the managed clusters that you provision. You can customize how {rh-rhacm-first} uses `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs to generate the applied policy CRs.

[NOTE]
====
When managing large numbers of spoke clusters on the hub cluster, minimize the number of policies to reduce resource consumption.

Grouping multiple configuration CRs into a single or limited number of policies is one way to reduce the overall number of policies on the hub cluster. When using the common, group, and site hierarchy of policies for managing site configuration, it is especially important to combine site-specific configuration into a single policy.
