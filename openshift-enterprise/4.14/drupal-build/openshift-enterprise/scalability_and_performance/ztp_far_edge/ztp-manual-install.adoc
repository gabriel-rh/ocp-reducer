:context: ztp-manual-install


You can deploy a managed {sno} cluster by using {rh-rhacm-first} and the assisted service.

[NOTE]
====
If you are creating multiple managed clusters, use the `SiteConfig` method described in xref:ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites[Deploying far edge sites with ZTP].
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The target bare-metal host must meet the networking, firmware, and hardware requirements listed in xref:sno-configure-for-vdu[Recommended cluster configuration for vDU application workloads].
