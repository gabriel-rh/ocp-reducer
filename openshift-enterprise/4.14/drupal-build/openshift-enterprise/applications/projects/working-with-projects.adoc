isolation from other communities.

[NOTE]
====
Projects starting with `openshift-` and `kube-` are  link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/authentication_and_authorization/#rbac-default-projects_using-rbac[default projects]. These projects host cluster components that run as pods and other infrastructure components. As such, {product-title} does not allow you to create projects starting with `openshift-` or `kube-` using the `oc new-project` command. Cluster administrators can create these projects using the `oc adm new-project` command.
