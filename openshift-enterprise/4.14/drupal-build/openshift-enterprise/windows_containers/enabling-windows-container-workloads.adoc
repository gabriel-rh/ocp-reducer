Before adding Windows workloads to your cluster, you must install the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO), which is available in the {product-title} OperatorHub. The WMCO orchestrates the process of deploying and managing Windows workloads on a cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Dual NIC is not supported on WMCO-managed Windows instances.

== Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have installed your cluster using installer-provisioned infrastructure, or using user-provisioned infrastructure with the `platform: none` field set in your `install-config.yaml` file.

* You have configured hybrid networking with OVN-Kubernetes for your cluster. This must be completed during the installation of your cluster. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/networking/#configuring-hybrid-ovnkubernetes[Configuring hybrid networking].

* You are running an {product-title} cluster version 4.6.8 or later.

[NOTE]
====
Windows instances deployed by the WMCO are configured with the containerd container runtime. Because WMCO installs and manages the runtime, it is recommanded that you do not manually install containerd on nodes.
