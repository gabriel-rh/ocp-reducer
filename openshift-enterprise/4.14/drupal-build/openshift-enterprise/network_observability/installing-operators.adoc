:context: network_observability

Installing Loki is a recommended prerequisite for using the Network Observability Operator. You can choose to use xref:network-observability-without-loki_network_observability[Network Observability without Loki], but there are some considerations for doing this, described in the previously linked section.

The {loki-op} integrates a gateway that implements multi-tenancy and authentication with Loki for data flow storage. The `LokiStack` resource manages Loki, which is a scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system, and a web proxy with {product-title} authentication. The `LokiStack` proxy uses {product-title} authentication to enforce multi-tenancy and facilitate the saving and indexing of data in Loki log stores.

[NOTE]
====
The {loki-op} can also be used for link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/logging/#cluster-logging-loki[configuring the LokiStack log store]. The Network Observability Operator requires a dedicated LokiStack separate from the {logging}.

== Important Flow Collector configuration considerations
Once you create the `FlowCollector` instance, you can reconfigure it, but the pods are terminated and recreated again, which can be disruptive. Therefore, you can consider configuring the following options when creating the `FlowCollector` for the first time:

* xref:network-observability-flowcollector-kafka-config_network_observability[Configuring the Flow Collector resource with Kafka]
* xref:network-observability-enriched-flows_network_observability[Export enriched network flow data to Kafka or IPFIX]
* xref:network-observability-SR-IOV-config_network_observability[Configuring monitoring for SR-IOV interface traffic]
* xref:network-observability-working-with-conversations_nw-observe-network-traffic[Working with conversation tracking]
* xref:network-observability-dns-tracking_nw-observe-network-traffic[Working with DNS tracking]
* xref:network-observability-packet-drops_nw-observe-network-traffic[Working with packet drops]
