[WARNING]
====
Jaeger is deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing 3.0.
====

You can install {DTProductName} on {product-title} in either of two ways:

* You can install {DTProductName} as part of {SMProductName}. Distributed tracing is included by default in the Service Mesh installation. To install {DTProductName} as part of a service mesh, follow the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/service_mesh/#preparing-ossm-installation[Red Hat Service Mesh Installation] instructions. You must install {DTProductName} in the same namespace as your service mesh, that is, the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` and the {DTProductName} resources must be in the same namespace.

* If you do not want to install a service mesh, you can use the {DTProductName} Operators to install {DTShortName} by itself. To install {DTProductName} without a service mesh, use the following instructions.

[id="prerequisites"]
