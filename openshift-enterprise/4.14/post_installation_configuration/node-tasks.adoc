[id="rhel-compute-overview_{context}"]
= About adding RHEL compute nodes to a cluster

In {product-title} {product-version}, you have the option of using {op-system-base-full} machines as compute machines in your cluster if you use a user-provisioned or installer-provisioned infrastructure installation on the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures. You must use {op-system-first} machines for the control plane machines in your cluster.

If you choose to use {op-system-base} compute machines in your cluster, you are responsible for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance. You must perform system updates, apply patches, and complete all other required tasks.

For installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, you must manually add {op-system-base} compute machines because automatic scaling in installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters adds Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) compute machines by default.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Because removing {product-title} from a machine in the cluster requires destroying the operating system, you must use dedicated hardware for any {op-system-base} machines that you add to the cluster.

* Swap memory is disabled on all {op-system-base} machines that you add to your {product-title} cluster. You cannot enable swap memory on these machines.
====

You must add any {op-system-base} compute machines to the cluster after you initialize the control plane.

[id="rhel-compute-requirements_{context}"]
= System requirements for {op-system-base} compute nodes

The {op-system-base-full} compute machine hosts in your {product-title} environment must meet the following minimum hardware specifications and system-level requirements:

* You must have an active {product-title} subscription on your Red Hat account. If you do not, contact your sales representative for more information.

* Production environments must provide compute machines to support your expected workloads. As a cluster administrator, you must calculate the expected workload and add about 10% for overhead. For production environments, allocate enough resources so that a node host failure does not affect your maximum capacity.
* Each system must meet the following hardware requirements:
** Physical or virtual system, or an instance running on a public or private IaaS.
** NetworkManager 1.0 or later.
** 1 vCPU.
** Minimum 8 GB RAM.
** Minimum 15 GB hard disk space for the file system containing `/var/`.
** Minimum 1 GB hard disk space for the file system containing `/usr/local/bin/`.
** Minimum 1 GB hard disk space for the file system containing its temporary directory. The temporary system directory is determined according to the rules defined in the tempfile module in the Python standard library.
* Each system must meet any additional requirements for your system provider. For example, if you installed your cluster on VMware vSphere, your disks must be configured according to its link:https://vmware.github.io/vsphere-storage-for-kubernetes/documentation/index.html[storage guidelines] and the `disk.enableUUID=true` attribute must be set.

* Each system must be able to access the cluster's API endpoints by using DNS-resolvable hostnames. Any network security access control that is in place must allow system access to the cluster's API service endpoints.

[id="csr-management_{context}"]
= Certificate signing requests management

Because your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management when you use infrastructure that you provision, you must provide a mechanism for approving cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation. The `kube-controller-manager` only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The `machine-approver` cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests and approving them.

[id="rhel-preparing-playbook-machine_{context}"]
= Preparing the machine to run the playbook

Before you can add compute machines that use {op-system-base-full} as the operating system to an {product-title} {product-version} cluster, you must prepare a {op-system-base} 8 machine to run an Ansible playbook that adds the new node to the cluster. This machine is not part of the cluster but must be able to access it.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) on the machine that you run the playbook on.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. Ensure that the `kubeconfig` file for the cluster and the installation program that you used to install the cluster are on the {op-system-base} 8 machine. One way to accomplish this is to use the same machine that you used to install the cluster.

. Configure the machine to access all of the {op-system-base} hosts that you plan to use as compute machines. You can use any method that your company allows, including a bastion with an SSH proxy or a VPN.

. Configure a user on the machine that you run the playbook on that has SSH access to all of the {op-system-base} hosts.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you use SSH key-based authentication, you must manage the key with an SSH agent.
====

. If you have not already done so, register the machine with RHSM and attach a pool with an `OpenShift` subscription to it:
.. Register the machine with RHSM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager register --username=<user_name> --password=<password>
----

.. Pull the latest subscription data from RHSM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager refresh
----

.. List the available subscriptions:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager list --available --matches '*OpenShift*'
----

.. In the output for the previous command, find the pool ID for an {product-title} subscription and attach it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----

. Enable the repositories required by {product-title} {product-version}:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms" \
    --enable="rhocp-{product-version}-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms"
----

. Install the required packages, including `openshift-ansible`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# yum install openshift-ansible openshift-clients jq
----
+
The `openshift-ansible` package provides installation program utilities and pulls in other packages that you require to add a {op-system-base} compute node to your cluster, such as Ansible, playbooks, and related configuration files. The `openshift-clients` provides the `oc` CLI, and the `jq` package improves the display of JSON output on your command line.

[id="rhel-preparing-node_{context}"]
= Preparing a RHEL compute node

Before you add a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machine to your {product-title} cluster, you must register each host with Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM), attach an active {product-title} subscription, and enable the required repositories.

. On each host, register with RHSM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager register --username=<user_name> --password=<password>
----

. Pull the latest subscription data from RHSM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager refresh
----

. List the available subscriptions:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager list --available --matches '*OpenShift*'
----

. In the output for the previous command, find the pool ID for an {product-title} subscription and attach it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----

. Disable all yum repositories:
.. Disable all the enabled RHSM repositories:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="*"
----

.. List the remaining yum repositories and note their names under `repo id`, if any:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# yum repolist
----

.. Use `yum-config-manager` to disable the remaining yum repositories:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# yum-config-manager --disable <repo_id>
----
+
Alternatively, disable all repositories:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# yum-config-manager --disable \*
----
+
Note that this might take a few minutes if you have a large number of available repositories

. Enable only the repositories required by {product-title} {product-version}:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms" \
    --enable="rhocp-{product-version}-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms" \
    --enable="fast-datapath-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms"
----

. Stop and disable firewalld on the host:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# systemctl disable --now firewalld.service
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You must not enable firewalld later. If you do, you cannot access {product-title} logs on the worker.

== Adding {op-system} compute machines to an {product-title} cluster

You can add more {op-system-first} compute machines to your {product-title} cluster on bare metal.

Before you add more compute machines to a cluster that you installed on bare metal infrastructure, you must create {op-system} machines for it to use. You can either use an ISO image or network PXE booting to create the machines.

//Prerequisites also in adding-bare-metal-compute-user-infra.adoc
=== Prerequisites

* You installed a cluster on bare metal.
* You have installation media and {op-system-first} images that you used to create your cluster.

= Creating {op-system} machines using an ISO image

You can create more {op-system-first} compute machines for your bare metal cluster by using an ISO image to create the machines.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the URL of the Ignition config file for the compute machines for your cluster. You uploaded this file to your HTTP server during installation.
* You must have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`)  installed.

.Procedure

. Extract the Ignition config file from the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc extract -n openshift-machine-api secret/worker-user-data-managed --keys=userData --to=- > worker.ign
----

. Upload the `worker.ign` Ignition config file you exported from your cluster to your HTTP server. Note the URLs of these files.

. You can validate that the ignition files are available on the URLs. The following example gets the Ignition config files for the compute node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -k http://<HTTP_server>/worker.ign
----

. You can access the ISO image for booting your new machine by running to following command:

. Use the ISO file to install {op-system} on more compute machines. Use the same method that you used when you created machines before you installed the cluster:
** Burn the ISO image to a disk and boot it directly.
** Use ISO redirection with a LOM interface.

. Boot the {op-system} ISO image without specifying any options, or interrupting the live boot sequence. Wait for the installer to boot into a shell prompt in the {op-system} live environment.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can interrupt the {op-system} installation boot process to add kernel arguments. However, for this ISO procedure you must use the `coreos-installer` command as outlined in the following steps, instead of adding kernel arguments.
====

. Run the `coreos-installer` command and specify the options that meet your installation requirements. At a minimum, you must specify the URL that points to the Ignition config file for the node type, and the device that you are installing to:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo coreos-installer install --ignition-url=http://<HTTP_server>/<node_type>.ign <device> --ignition-hash=sha512-<digest> <1><2>
----
<1> You must run the `coreos-installer` command by using `sudo`, because the `core` user does not have the required root privileges to perform the installation.
<2> The `--ignition-hash` option is required when the Ignition config file is obtained through an HTTP URL to validate the authenticity of the Ignition config file on the cluster node. `<digest>` is the Ignition config file SHA512 digest obtained in a preceding step.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to provide your Ignition config files through an HTTPS server that uses TLS, you can add the internal certificate authority (CA) to the system trust store before running `coreos-installer`.
====
+
The following example initializes a bootstrap node installation to the `/dev/sda` device. The Ignition config file for the bootstrap node is obtained from an HTTP web server with the IP address 192.168.1.2:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo coreos-installer install --ignition-url=http://192.168.1.2:80/installation_directory/bootstrap.ign /dev/sda --ignition-hash=sha512-a5a2d43879223273c9b60af66b44202a1d1248fc01cf156c46d4a79f552b6bad47bc8cc78ddf0116e80c59d2ea9e32ba53bc807afbca581aa059311def2c3e3b
----

. Monitor the progress of the {op-system} installation on the console of the machine.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the installation is successful on each node before commencing with the {product-title} installation. Observing the installation process can also help to determine the cause of {op-system} installation issues that might arise.
====

. Continue to create more compute machines for your cluster.

= Creating {op-system} machines by PXE or iPXE booting

You can create more {op-system-first} compute machines for your bare metal cluster by using PXE or iPXE booting.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the URL of the Ignition config file for the compute machines for your cluster. You uploaded this file to your HTTP server during installation.
* Obtain the URLs of the {op-system} ISO image, compressed metal BIOS, `kernel`, and `initramfs` files that you uploaded to your HTTP server during cluster installation.
* You have access to the PXE booting infrastructure that you used to create the machines for your {product-title} cluster during installation. The machines must boot from their local disks after {op-system} is installed on them.
* If you use UEFI, you have access to the `grub.conf` file that you modified during {product-title} installation.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="installation-approve-csrs_{context}"]
= Approving the certificate signing requests for your machines

When you add machines to a cluster, two pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) are generated for each machine that you added. You must confirm that these CSRs are approved or, if necessary, approve them yourself. The client requests must be approved first, followed by the server requests.

.Prerequisites

* You added machines to your cluster.

.Procedure

. Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  63m  v1.27.3
master-1  Ready     master  63m  v1.27.3
master-2  Ready     master  64m  v1.27.3
----
+
The output lists all of the machines that you created.
+
[NOTE]
====
The preceding output might not include the compute nodes, also known as worker nodes, until some CSRs are approved.
====

. Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the `Pending` or `Approved` status for each machine that you added to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-8b2br   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
csr-8vnps   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
...
----
+
In this example, two machines are joining the cluster. You might see more approved CSRs in the list.

. If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:
+
[NOTE]
====
Because the CSRs rotate automatically, approve your CSRs within an hour of adding the machines to the cluster. If you do not approve them within an hour, the certificates will rotate, and more than two certificates will be present for each node. You must approve all of these certificates. After the client CSR is approved, the Kubelet creates a secondary CSR for the serving certificate, which requires manual approval. Then, subsequent serving certificate renewal requests are automatically approved by the `machine-approver` if the Kubelet requests a new certificate with identical parameters.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
For clusters running on platforms that are not machine API enabled, such as bare metal and other user-provisioned infrastructure, you must implement a method of automatically approving the kubelet serving certificate requests (CSRs). If a request is not approved, then the `oc exec`, `oc rsh`, and `oc logs` commands cannot succeed, because a serving certificate is required when the API server connects to the kubelet. Any operation that contacts the Kubelet endpoint requires this certificate approval to be in place. The method must watch for new CSRs, confirm that the CSR was submitted by the `node-bootstrapper` service account in the `system:node` or `system:admin` groups, and confirm the identity of the node.
====

** To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

** To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Some Operators might not become available until some CSRs are approved.
====

. Now that your client requests are approved, you must review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-bfd72   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-50-126.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
csr-c57lv   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-95-157.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
...
----

. If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

** To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

** To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
----

. After all client and server CSRs have been approved, the machines have the `Ready` status. Verify this by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  73m  v1.27.3
master-1  Ready     master  73m  v1.27.3
master-2  Ready     master  74m  v1.27.3
worker-0  Ready     worker  11m  v1.27.3
worker-1  Ready     worker  11m  v1.27.3
----
+
[NOTE]
====
It can take a few minutes after approval of the server CSRs for the machines to transition to the `Ready` status.

[id="machine-node-custom-partition_{context}"]
= Adding a new {op-system} worker node with a custom `/var` partition in AWS

{product-title} supports partitioning devices during installation by using machine configs that are processed during the bootstrap. However, if you use `/var` partitioning, the device name must be determined at installation and cannot be changed. You cannot add different instance types as nodes if they have a different device naming schema. For example, if you configured the `/var` partition with the default AWS device name for `m4.large` instances, `dev/xvdb`, you cannot directly add an AWS `m5.large` instance, as `m5.large` instances use a `/dev/nvme1n1` device by default. The device might fail to partition due to the different naming schema.

The procedure in this section shows how to add a new {op-system-first} compute node with an instance that uses a different device name from what was configured at installation. You create a custom user data secret and configure a new compute machine set. These steps are specific to an AWS cluster. The principles apply to other cloud deployments also. However, the device naming schema is different for other deployments and should be determined on a per-case basis.

.Procedure

. On a command line, change to the `openshift-machine-api` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project openshift-machine-api
----

. Create a new secret from the `worker-user-data` secret:

.. Export the `userData` section of the secret to a text file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secret worker-user-data --template='{{index .data.userData | base64decode}}' | jq > userData.txt
----

.. Edit the text file to add the `storage`, `filesystems`, and `systemd` stanzas for the partitions you want to use for the new node. You can specify any link:https://coreos.github.io/ignition/configuration-v3_2/[Ignition configuration parameters] as needed.
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not change the values in the `ignition` stanza.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can use the advanced machine management and scaling capabilities only in clusters where the Machine API is operational. Clusters with user-provisioned infrastructure require additional validation and configuration to use the Machine API.

Clusters with the infrastructure platform type `none` cannot use the Machine API. This limitation applies even if the compute machines that are attached to the cluster are installed on a platform that supports the feature. This parameter cannot be changed after installation.

To view the platform type for your cluster, run the following command:

[id="machine-health-checks-about_{context}"]
= About machine health checks

[NOTE]
====
You can only apply a machine health check to machines that are managed by compute machine sets or control plane machine sets.
====

To monitor machine health, create a resource to define the configuration for a controller. Set a condition to check, such as staying in the `NotReady` status for five minutes or displaying a permanent condition in the node-problem-detector, and a label for the set of machines to monitor.

The controller that observes a `MachineHealthCheck` resource checks for the defined condition. If a machine fails the health check, the machine is automatically deleted and one is created to take its place. When a machine is deleted, you see a `machine deleted` event.

To limit disruptive impact of the machine deletion, the controller drains and deletes only one node at a time. If there are more unhealthy machines than the `maxUnhealthy` threshold allows for in the targeted pool of machines, remediation stops and therefore enables manual intervention.

[NOTE]
====
Consider the timeouts carefully, accounting for workloads and requirements.

* Long timeouts can result in long periods of downtime for the workload on the unhealthy machine.
* Too short timeouts can result in a remediation loop. For example, the timeout for checking the `NotReady` status must be long enough to allow the machine to complete the startup process.
====

To stop the check, remove the resource.

[id="machine-health-checks-limitations_{context}"]
== Limitations when deploying machine health checks

There are limitations to consider before deploying a machine health check:

* Only machines owned by a machine set are remediated by a machine health check.
* If the node for a machine is removed from the cluster, a machine health check considers the machine to be unhealthy and remediates it immediately.
* If the corresponding node for a machine does not join the cluster after the `nodeStartupTimeout`, the machine is remediated.
* A machine is remediated immediately if the `Machine` resource phase is `Failed`.

The `MachineHealthCheck` resource for all cloud-based installation types, and other than bare metal, resembles the following YAML file:

[source,yaml]

----
<1> Specify the name of the machine health check to deploy.
<2> Specify a label for the machine pool that you want to check.
<3> Specify the machine set to track in `<cluster_name>-<label>-<zone>` format. For example, `prod-node-us-east-1a`.
<4> Specify the timeout duration for a node condition. If a condition is met for the duration of the timeout, the machine will be remediated. Long timeouts can result in long periods of downtime for a workload on an unhealthy machine.
<5> Specify the amount of machines allowed to be concurrently remediated in the targeted pool. This can be set as a percentage or an integer. If the number of unhealthy machines exceeds the limit set by `maxUnhealthy`, remediation is not performed.
<6> Specify the timeout duration that a machine health check must wait for a node to join the cluster before a machine is determined to be unhealthy.

[NOTE]
====
The `matchLabels` are examples only; you must map your machine groups based on your specific needs.
====

[id="machine-health-checks-short-circuiting_{context}"]
== Short-circuiting machine health check remediation

Short-circuiting ensures that machine health checks remediate machines only when the cluster is healthy.
Short-circuiting is configured through the `maxUnhealthy` field in the `MachineHealthCheck` resource.

If the user defines a value for the `maxUnhealthy` field, before remediating any machines, the `MachineHealthCheck` compares the value of `maxUnhealthy` with the number of machines within its target pool that it has determined to be unhealthy. Remediation is not performed if the number of unhealthy machines exceeds the `maxUnhealthy` limit.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If `maxUnhealthy` is not set, the value defaults to `100%` and the machines are remediated regardless of the state of the cluster.
====

The appropriate `maxUnhealthy` value depends on the scale of the cluster you deploy and how many machines the `MachineHealthCheck` covers. For example, you can use the `maxUnhealthy` value to cover multiple compute machine sets across multiple availability zones so that if you lose an entire zone, your `maxUnhealthy` setting prevents further remediation within the cluster. In global Azure regions that do not have multiple availability zones, you can use availability sets to ensure high availability.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you configure a `MachineHealthCheck` resource for the control plane, set the value of `maxUnhealthy` to `1`.

This configuration ensures that the machine health check takes no action when multiple control plane machines appear to be unhealthy. Multiple unhealthy control plane machines can indicate that the etcd cluster is degraded or that a scaling operation to replace a failed machine is in progress.

If the etcd cluster is degraded, manual intervention might be required. If a scaling operation is in progress, the machine health check should allow it to finish.
====

The `maxUnhealthy` field can be set as either an integer or percentage.
There are different remediation implementations depending on the `maxUnhealthy` value.

=== Setting maxUnhealthy by using an absolute value

If `maxUnhealthy` is set to `2`:

* Remediation will be performed if 2 or fewer nodes are unhealthy
* Remediation will not be performed if 3 or more nodes are unhealthy

These values are independent of how many machines are being checked by the machine health check.

=== Setting maxUnhealthy by using percentages

If `maxUnhealthy` is set to `40%` and there are 25 machines being checked:

* Remediation will be performed if 10 or fewer nodes are unhealthy
* Remediation will not be performed if 11 or more nodes are unhealthy

If `maxUnhealthy` is set to `40%` and there are 6 machines being checked:

* Remediation will be performed if 2 or fewer nodes are unhealthy
* Remediation will not be performed if 3 or more nodes are unhealthy

[NOTE]
====
The allowed number of machines is rounded down when the percentage of `maxUnhealthy` machines that are checked is not a whole number.

[id="machineset-manually-scaling_{context}"]
= Scaling a compute machine set manually

To add or remove an instance of a machine in a compute machine set, you can manually scale the compute machine set.

This guidance is relevant to fully automated, installer-provisioned infrastructure installations. Customized, user-provisioned infrastructure installations do not have compute machine sets.

.Prerequisites

* Install an {product-title} cluster and the `oc` command line.
* Log in to  `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. View the compute machine sets that are in the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
The compute machine sets are listed in the form of `<clusterid>-worker-<aws-region-az>`.

. View the compute machines that are in the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machine -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Set the annotation on the compute machine that you want to delete by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate machine/<machine_name> -n openshift-machine-api machine.openshift.io/delete-machine="true"
----

. Scale the compute machine set by running one of the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to scale the compute machine set:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata:
  name: <machineset>
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
  replicas: 2
----
====
+
You can scale the compute machine set up or down. It takes several minutes for the new machines to be available.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, the machine controller tries to drain the node that is backed by the machine until it succeeds. In some situations, such as with a misconfigured pod disruption budget, the drain operation might not be able to succeed. If the drain operation fails, the machine controller cannot proceed removing the machine.

You can skip draining the node by annotating `machine.openshift.io/exclude-node-draining` in a specific machine.
====

.Verification

* Verify the deletion of the intended machine by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machines

= Understanding the difference between compute machine sets and the machine config pool

`MachineSet` objects describe {product-title} nodes with respect to the cloud or machine provider.

The `MachineConfigPool` object allows `MachineConfigController` components to define and provide the status of machines in the context of upgrades.

The `MachineConfigPool` object allows users to configure how upgrades are rolled out to the {product-title} nodes in the machine config pool.

The `NodeSelector` object can be replaced with a reference to the `MachineSet` object.

[id="recommended-node-host-practices_{context}"]
= Recommended node host practices

The {product-title} node configuration file contains important options. For
example, two parameters control the maximum number of pods that can be scheduled
to a node: `podsPerCore` and `maxPods`.

When both options are in use, the lower of the two values limits the number of
pods on a node. Exceeding these values can result in:

* Increased CPU utilization.
* Slow pod scheduling.
* Potential out-of-memory scenarios, depending on the amount of memory in the node.
* Exhausting the pool of IP addresses.
* Resource overcommitting, leading to poor user application performance.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In Kubernetes, a pod that is holding a single container actually uses two
containers. The second container is used to set up networking prior to the
actual container starting. Therefore, a system running 10 pods will actually
have 20 containers running.
====

[NOTE]
====
Disk IOPS throttling from the cloud provider might have an impact on CRI-O and kubelet.
They might get overloaded when there are large number of I/O intensive pods running on
the nodes. It is recommended that you monitor the disk I/O on the nodes and use volumes
with sufficient throughput for the workload.
====

`podsPerCore` sets the number of pods the node can run based on the number of
processor cores on the node. For example, if `podsPerCore` is set to `10` on a
node with 4 processor cores, the maximum number of pods allowed on the node will
be `40`.

[source,yaml]
----
kubeletConfig:
  podsPerCore: 10
----

Setting `podsPerCore` to `0` disables this limit. The default is `0`.
`podsPerCore` cannot exceed `maxPods`.

`maxPods` sets the number of pods the node can run to a fixed value, regardless
of the properties of the node.

    maxPods: 250

[id="create-a-kubeletconfig-crd-to-edit-kubelet-parameters_{context}"]
= Creating a KubeletConfig CRD to edit kubelet parameters

The kubelet configuration is currently serialized as an Ignition configuration, so it can be directly edited. However, there is also a new `kubelet-config-controller` added to the Machine Config Controller (MCC). This lets you use a `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) to edit the kubelet parameters.

[NOTE]
====
As the fields in the `kubeletConfig` object are passed directly to the kubelet from upstream Kubernetes, the kubelet validates those values directly. Invalid values in the `kubeletConfig` object might cause cluster nodes to become unavailable. For valid values, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1/[Kubernetes documentation].
====

Consider the following guidance:

* Create one `KubeletConfig` CR for each machine config pool with all the config changes you want for that pool. If you are applying the same content to all of the pools, you need only one `KubeletConfig` CR for all of the pools.

* Edit an existing `KubeletConfig` CR to modify existing settings or add new settings, instead of creating a CR for each change. It is recommended that you create a CR only to modify a different machine config pool, or for changes that are intended to be temporary, so that you can revert the changes.

* As needed, create multiple `KubeletConfig` CRs with a limit of 10 per cluster. For the first `KubeletConfig` CR, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) creates a machine config appended with `kubelet`. With each subsequent CR, the controller creates another `kubelet` machine config with a numeric suffix. For example, if you have a `kubelet` machine config with a `-2` suffix, the next `kubelet` machine config is appended with `-3`.

If you want to delete the machine configs, delete them in reverse order to avoid exceeding the limit. For example, you delete the `kubelet-3` machine config before deleting the `kubelet-2` machine config.

[NOTE]
====
If you have a machine config with a `kubelet-9` suffix, and you create another `KubeletConfig` CR, a new machine config is not created, even if there are fewer than 10 `kubelet` machine configs.
====

The following procedure is an example to show how to configure the maximum number of pods per node on the worker nodes.

.Prerequisites

. Obtain the label associated with the static `MachineConfigPool` CR for the type of node you want to configure.
Perform one of the following steps:

.. View the machine config pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe machineconfigpool <name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe machineconfigpool worker
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2019-02-08T14:52:39Z
  generation: 1
  labels:
    custom-kubelet: set-max-pods <1>
----
<1> If a label has been added it appears under `labels`.

.. If the label is not present, add a key/value pair:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label machineconfigpool worker custom-kubelet=set-max-pods
----

.Procedure

. View the available machine configuration objects that you can select:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfig
----
+
By default, the two kubelet-related configs are `01-master-kubelet` and `01-worker-kubelet`.

. Check the current value for the maximum pods per node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node <node_name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node ci-ln-5grqprb-f76d1-ncnqq-worker-a-mdv94
----
+
Look for `value: pods: <value>` in the `Allocatable` stanza:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Allocatable:
 attachable-volumes-aws-ebs:  25

 pods:                        250
----

. Set the maximum pods per node on the worker nodes by creating a custom resource file that contains the kubelet configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: set-max-pods

  kubeletConfig:
    maxPods: 500 <2>
----
<1> Enter the label from the machine config pool.
<2> Add the kubelet configuration. In this example, use `maxPods` to set the maximum pods per node.
+
[NOTE]
====
The rate at which the kubelet talks to the API server depends on queries per second (QPS) and burst values. The default values, `50` for `kubeAPIQPS` and `100` for `kubeAPIBurst`, are sufficient if there are limited pods running on each node. It is recommended to update the kubelet QPS and burst rates if there are enough CPU and memory resources on the node.

[source,yaml]

  kubeletConfig:
    maxPods: <pod_count>
    kubeAPIBurst: <burst_rate>
    kubeAPIQPS: <QPS>
----
====
.. Update the machine config pool for workers with the label:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label machineconfigpool worker custom-kubelet=set-max-pods
----

.. Create the `KubeletConfig` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f change-maxPods-cr.yaml
----

.. Verify that the `KubeletConfig` object is created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get kubeletconfig
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                AGE
set-max-pods        15m
----
+
Depending on the number of worker nodes in the cluster, wait for the worker nodes to be rebooted one by one. For a cluster with 3 worker nodes, this could take about 10 to 15 minutes.

. Verify that the changes are applied to the node:

.. Check on a worker node that the `maxPods` value changed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node <node_name>
----

.. Locate the `Allocatable` stanza:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 ...
Allocatable:
  attachable-volumes-gce-pd:  127
  cpu:                        3500m

  hugepages-2Mi:              0
  memory:                     14225400Ki
  pods:                       500 <1>
 ...
----
<1> In this example, the `pods` parameter should report the value you set in the `KubeletConfig` object.

. Verify the change in the `KubeletConfig` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get kubeletconfigs set-max-pods -o yaml
----
+
This should show a status of `True` and `type:Success`, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:

= Modifying the number of unavailable worker nodes

By default, only one machine is allowed to be unavailable when applying the kubelet-related configuration to the available worker nodes. For a large cluster, it can take a long time for the configuration change to be reflected. At any time, you can adjust the number of machines that are updating to speed up the process.

.Procedure

. Edit the `worker` machine config pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineconfigpool worker
----

. Add the `maxUnavailable` field and set the value:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  maxUnavailable: <node_count>
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When setting the value, consider the number of worker nodes that can be
unavailable without affecting the applications running on the cluster.

=  Control plane node sizing

The control plane node resource requirements depend on the number and type of nodes and objects in the cluster. The following control plane node size recommendations are based on the results of a control plane density focused testing, or _Cluster-density_. This test creates the following objects across a given number of namespaces:

- 1 image stream
- 1 build
- 5 deployments, with 2 pod replicas in a `sleep` state, mounting 4 secrets, 4 config maps, and 1 downward API volume each
- 5 services, each one pointing to the TCP/8080 and TCP/8443 ports of one of the previous deployments
- 1 route pointing to the first of the previous services
- 10 secrets containing 2048 random string characters
- 10 config maps containing 2048 random string characters

The data from the table above is based on an {product-title} running on top of AWS, using r5.4xlarge instances as control-plane nodes and m5.2xlarge instances as worker nodes.

On a large and dense cluster with three control plane nodes, the CPU and memory usage will spike up when one of the nodes is stopped, rebooted, or fails. The failures can be due to unexpected issues with power, network, underlying infrastructure, or intentional cases where the cluster is restarted after shutting it down to save costs. The remaining two control plane nodes must handle the load in order to be highly available, which leads to increase in the resource usage. This is also expected during upgrades because the control plane nodes are cordoned, drained, and rebooted serially to apply the operating system updates, as well as the control plane Operators update. To avoid cascading failures, keep the overall CPU and memory resource usage on the control plane nodes to at most 60% of all available capacity to handle the resource usage spikes. Increase the CPU and memory on the control plane nodes accordingly to avoid potential downtime due to lack of resources.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The node sizing varies depending on the number of nodes and object counts in the cluster. It also depends on whether the objects are actively being created on the cluster. During object creation, the control plane is more active in terms of resource usage compared to when the objects are in the `running` phase.
====

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM ) runs on the control plane nodes and its memory footprint depends on the number of namespaces and user installed operators that OLM needs to manage on the cluster. Control plane nodes need to be sized accordingly to avoid OOM kills. Following data points are based on the results from cluster maximums testing.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can modify the control plane node size in a running {product-title} {product-version} cluster for the following configurations only:

* Clusters installed with a user-provisioned installation method.
* AWS clusters installed with an installer-provisioned infrastructure installation method.
* Clusters that use a control plane machine set to manage control plane machines.

For all other configurations, you must estimate your total node count and use the suggested control plane node size during installation.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The recommendations are based on the data points captured on {product-title} clusters with OpenShift SDN as the network plugin.
====

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} {product-version}, half of a CPU core (500 millicore) is now reserved by the system by default compared to {product-title} 3.11 and previous versions. The sizes are determined taking that into consideration.

= Setting up CPU Manager

.Procedure

. Optional: Label a node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc label node perf-node.example.com cpumanager=true
----

. Edit the `MachineConfigPool` of the nodes where CPU Manager should be enabled. In this example, all workers have CPU Manager enabled:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc edit machineconfigpool worker
----

. Add a label to the worker machine config pool:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2020-xx-xxx
  generation: 3
  labels:
    custom-kubelet: cpumanager-enabled
----

. Create a `KubeletConfig`, `cpumanager-kubeletconfig.yaml`, custom resource (CR). Refer to the label created in the previous step to have the correct nodes updated with the new kubelet config. See the `machineConfigPoolSelector` section:
+
[source,yaml]

  kubeletConfig:
     cpuManagerPolicy: static <1>
     cpuManagerReconcilePeriod: 5s <2>
----
<1> Specify a policy:
* `none`. This policy explicitly enables the existing default CPU affinity scheme, providing no affinity beyond what the scheduler does automatically. This is the default policy.
* `static`. This policy allows containers in guaranteed pods with integer CPU requests. It also limits access to exclusive CPUs on the node. If `static`, you must use a lowercase `s`.
<2> Optional. Specify the CPU Manager reconcile frequency. The default is `5s`.

. Create the dynamic kubelet config:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc create -f cpumanager-kubeletconfig.yaml
----
+
This adds the CPU Manager feature to the kubelet config and, if needed, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) reboots the node. To enable CPU Manager, a reboot is not needed.

. Check for the merged kubelet config:
+

[id="what-huge-pages-do_{context}"]
= What huge pages do

Memory is managed in blocks known as pages. On most systems, a page is 4Ki. 1Mi
of memory is equal to 256 pages; 1Gi of memory is 256,000 pages, and so on. CPUs
have a built-in memory management unit that manages a list of these pages in
hardware. The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is a small hardware cache of
virtual-to-physical page mappings. If the virtual address passed in a hardware
instruction can be found in the TLB, the mapping can be determined quickly. If
not, a TLB miss occurs, and the system falls back to slower, software-based
address translation, resulting in performance issues. Since the size of the TLB
is fixed, the only way to reduce the chance of a TLB miss is to increase the
page size.

A huge page is a memory page that is larger than 4Ki. On x86_64 architectures,
there are two common huge page sizes: 2Mi and 1Gi. Sizes vary on other
architectures. To use huge pages, code must be written so that
applications are aware of them. Transparent Huge Pages (THP) attempt to automate
the management of huge pages without application knowledge, but they have
limitations. In particular, they are limited to 2Mi page sizes. THP can lead to
performance degradation on nodes with high memory utilization or fragmentation
due to defragmenting efforts of THP, which can lock memory pages. For this
reason, some applications may be designed to (or recommend) usage of
pre-allocated huge pages instead of THP.

[id="how-huge-pages-are-consumed-by-apps_{context}"]
= How huge pages are consumed by apps

Nodes must pre-allocate huge pages in order for the node to report its huge page
capacity. A node can only pre-allocate huge pages for a single size.

Huge pages can be consumed through container-level resource requirements using the
resource name `hugepages-<size>`, where size is the most compact binary
notation using integer values supported on a particular node. For example, if a
node supports 2048KiB page sizes, it exposes a schedulable resource
`hugepages-2Mi`. Unlike CPU or memory, huge pages do not support over-commitment.

<1> Specify the amount of memory for `hugepages` as the exact amount to be
allocated. Do not specify this value as the amount of memory for `hugepages`
multiplied by the size of the page. For example, given a huge page size of 2MB,
if you want to use 100MB of huge-page-backed RAM for your application, then you
would allocate 50 huge pages. {product-title} handles the math for you. As in
the above example, you can specify `100MB` directly.

*Allocating huge pages of a specific size*

Some platforms support multiple huge page sizes. To allocate huge pages of a
specific size, precede the huge pages boot command parameters with a huge page
size selection parameter `hugepagesz=<size>`. The `<size>` value must be
specified in bytes with an optional scale suffix [`kKmMgG`]. The default huge
page size can be defined with the `default_hugepagesz=<size>` boot parameter.

*Huge page requirements*

* Huge page requests must equal the limits. This is the default if limits are
specified, but requests are not.

* Huge pages are isolated at a pod scope. Container isolation is planned in a
future iteration.

* `EmptyDir` volumes backed by huge pages must not consume more huge page memory
than the pod request.

* Applications that consume huge pages via `shmget()` with `SHM_HUGETLB` must run
with a supplemental group that matches *_proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group_*.

= Configuring huge pages at boot time

Nodes must pre-allocate huge pages used in an {product-title} cluster. There are two ways of reserving huge pages: at boot time and at run time. Reserving at boot time increases the possibility of success because the memory has not yet been significantly fragmented. The Node Tuning Operator currently supports boot time allocation of huge pages on specific nodes.

.Procedure

To minimize node reboots, the order of the steps below needs to be followed:

. Label all nodes that need the same huge pages setting by a label.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node_using_hugepages> node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-hp=

----
<1> Set the `name` of the Tuned resource to `hugepages`.
<2> Set the `profile` section to allocate huge pages.
<3> Note the order of parameters is important as some platforms support huge pages of various sizes.
<4> Enable machine config pool based matching.

. Create the Tuned `hugepages` object
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f hugepages-tuned-boottime.yaml

. Create the machine config pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f hugepages-mcp.yaml

Given enough non-fragmented memory, all the nodes in the `worker-hp` machine config pool should now have 50 2Mi huge pages allocated.

.Procedure

. Label the node so that the Node Tuning Operator knows on which node to apply the tuned profile, which describes how many huge pages should be allocated:
+
[source,terminal]

. Create the custom `hugepages` tuned profile by using the `hugepages-tuned-runtime.yaml` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f hugepages-tuned-runtime.yaml

. After creating the profile, the Operator applies the new profile to the correct
node and allocates huge pages. Check the logs of a tuned pod on a node using
huge pages to verify:

= Understanding device plugins

The device plugin provides a consistent and portable solution to consume hardware
devices across clusters. The device plugin provides support for these devices
through an extension mechanism, which makes these devices available to
Containers, provides health checks of these devices, and securely shares them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} supports the device plugin API, but the device plugin
Containers are supported by individual vendors.
====

A device plugin is a gRPC service running on the nodes (external to
the `kubelet`) that is responsible for managing specific
hardware resources. Any device plugin must support following remote procedure
calls (RPCs):

[source,golang]
----
service DevicePlugin {
      // GetDevicePluginOptions returns options to be communicated with Device
      // Manager
      rpc GetDevicePluginOptions(Empty) returns (DevicePluginOptions) {}

      // ListAndWatch returns a stream of List of Devices
      // Whenever a Device state change or a Device disappears, ListAndWatch
      // returns the new list
      rpc ListAndWatch(Empty) returns (stream ListAndWatchResponse) {}

      // Allocate is called during container creation so that the Device
      // Plug-in can run device specific operations and instruct Kubelet
      // of the steps to make the Device available in the container
      rpc Allocate(AllocateRequest) returns (AllocateResponse) {}

      // PreStartcontainer is called, if indicated by Device Plug-in during
      // registration phase, before each container start. Device plug-in
      // can run device specific operations such as reseting the device
      // before making devices available to the container
      rpc PreStartcontainer(PreStartcontainerRequest) returns (PreStartcontainerResponse) {}
}

[id="methods-for-deploying-a-device-plugin_{context}"]
== Methods for deploying a device plugin

* Daemon sets are the recommended approach for device plugin deployments.
* Upon start, the device plugin will try to create a UNIX domain socket at
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugin/_* on the node to serve RPCs from Device Manager.
* Since device plugins must manage hardware resources, access to the host
file system, as well as socket creation, they must be run in a privileged
security context.
* More specific details regarding deployment steps can be found with each device
plugin implementation.

= Understanding the Device Manager

Device Manager provides a mechanism for advertising specialized node hardware resources
with the help of plugins known as device plugins.

You can advertise specialized hardware without requiring any upstream code changes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} supports the device plugin API, but the device plugin
Containers are supported by individual vendors.
====

Device Manager advertises devices as *Extended Resources*. User pods can consume
devices, advertised by Device Manager, using the same *Limit/Request* mechanism,
which is used for requesting any other *Extended Resource*.

Upon start, the device plugin registers itself with Device Manager invoking `Register` on the
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/kubelet.sock_* and starts a gRPC service at
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/<plugin>.sock_* for serving Device Manager
requests.

Device Manager, while processing a new registration request, invokes
`ListAndWatch` remote procedure call (RPC) at the device plugin service. In
response, Device Manager gets a list of *Device* objects from the plugin over a
gRPC stream. Device Manager will keep watching on the stream for new updates
from the plugin. On the plugin side, the plugin will also keep the stream
open and whenever there is a change in the state of any of the devices, a new
device list is sent to the Device Manager over the same streaming connection.

While handling a new pod admission request, Kubelet passes requested `Extended
Resources` to the Device Manager for device allocation. Device Manager checks in
its database to verify if a corresponding plugin exists or not. If the plugin exists
and there are free allocatable devices as well as per local cache, `Allocate`
RPC is invoked at that particular device plugin.

Additionally, device plugins can also perform several other device-specific
operations, such as driver installation, device initialization, and device
resets. These functionalities vary from implementation to implementation.

= Understanding taints and tolerations

A _taint_ allows a node to refuse a pod to be scheduled unless that pod has a matching _toleration_.

You apply taints to a node through the `Node` specification (`NodeSpec`) and apply tolerations to a pod through the `Pod` specification (`PodSpec`). When you apply a taint a node, the scheduler cannot place a pod on that node unless the pod can tolerate the taint.

[id="nodes-scheduler-taints-tolerations-about-seconds_{context}"]
== Understanding how to use toleration seconds to delay pod evictions

You can specify how long a pod can remain bound to a node before being evicted by specifying the `tolerationSeconds` parameter in the `Pod` specification or `MachineSet` object. If a taint with the `NoExecute` effect is added to a node, a pod that does tolerate the taint, which has the `tolerationSeconds` parameter, the pod is not evicted until that time period expires.

.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1

metadata:
  name: my-pod
#...
spec:
  tolerations:

    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value1"
    effect: "NoExecute"
    tolerationSeconds: 3600
#...
----

Here, if this pod is running but does not have a matching toleration, the pod stays bound to the node for 3,600 seconds and then be evicted. If the taint is removed before that time, the pod is not evicted.

[id="nodes-scheduler-taints-tolerations-about-multiple_{context}"]
== Understanding how to use multiple taints

You can put multiple taints on the same node and multiple tolerations on the same pod. {product-title} processes multiple taints and tolerations as follows:

. Process the taints for which the pod has a matching toleration.
. The remaining unmatched taints have the indicated effects on the pod:
+
* If there is at least one unmatched taint with effect `NoSchedule`, {product-title} cannot schedule a pod onto that node.
* If there is no unmatched taint with effect `NoSchedule` but there is at least one unmatched taint with effect `PreferNoSchedule`, {product-title} tries to not schedule the pod onto the node.
* If there is at least one unmatched taint with effect `NoExecute`, {product-title} evicts the pod from the node if it is already running on the node, or the pod is not scheduled onto the node if it is not yet running on the node.
+
** Pods that do not tolerate the taint are evicted immediately.
+
** Pods that tolerate the taint without specifying `tolerationSeconds` in their `Pod` specification remain bound forever.
+
** Pods that tolerate the taint with a specified `tolerationSeconds` remain bound for the specified amount of time.

For example:

* Add the following taints to the node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoExecute
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 key2=value2:NoSchedule
----

* The pod has the following tolerations:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
#...
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: "key1"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value1"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  - key: "key1"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value1"
    effect: "NoExecute"
#...
----

In this case, the pod cannot be scheduled onto the node, because there is no toleration matching the third taint. The pod continues running if it is already running on the node when the taint is added, because the third taint is the only
one of the three that is not tolerated by the pod.

[id="nodes-scheduler-taints-tolerations-about-taintNodesByCondition_{context}"]
== Understanding pod scheduling and node conditions (taint node by condition)

The Taint Nodes By Condition feature, which is enabled by default, automatically taints nodes that report conditions such as memory pressure and disk pressure. If a node reports a condition, a taint is added until the condition clears. The taints have the `NoSchedule` effect, which means no pod can be scheduled on the node unless the pod has a matching toleration.

The scheduler checks for these taints on nodes before scheduling pods. If the taint is present, the pod is scheduled on a different node. Because the scheduler checks for taints and not the actual node conditions, you configure the scheduler to ignore some of these node conditions by adding appropriate pod tolerations.

To ensure backward compatibility, the daemon set controller automatically adds the following tolerations to all daemons:

* node.kubernetes.io/memory-pressure
* node.kubernetes.io/disk-pressure
* node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable (1.10 or later)
* node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable (host network only)

You can also add arbitrary tolerations to daemon sets.

[NOTE]
====
The control plane also adds the `node.kubernetes.io/memory-pressure` toleration on pods that have a QoS class. This is because Kubernetes manages pods in the `Guaranteed` or `Burstable` QoS classes. The new `BestEffort` pods do not get scheduled onto the affected node.
====

[id="nodes-scheduler-taints-tolerations-about-taintBasedEvictions_{context}"]
== Understanding evicting pods by condition (taint-based evictions)

The Taint-Based Evictions feature, which is enabled by default, evicts pods from a node that experiences specific conditions, such as `not-ready` and `unreachable`.
When a node experiences one of these conditions, {product-title} automatically adds taints to the node, and starts evicting and rescheduling the pods on different nodes.

Taint Based Evictions have a `NoExecute` effect, where any pod that does not tolerate the taint is evicted immediately and any pod that does tolerate the taint will never be evicted, unless the pod uses the `tolerationSeconds` parameter.

The `tolerationSeconds` parameter allows you to specify how long a pod stays bound to a node that has a node condition. If the condition still exists after the `tolerationSeconds` period, the taint remains on the node and the pods with a matching toleration are evicted. If the condition clears before the `tolerationSeconds` period, pods with matching tolerations are not removed.

If you use the `tolerationSeconds` parameter with no value, pods are never evicted because of the not ready and unreachable node conditions.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} evicts pods in a rate-limited way to prevent massive pod evictions in scenarios such as the master becoming partitioned from the nodes.

By default, if more than 55% of nodes in a given zone are unhealthy, the node lifecycle controller changes that zone's state to `PartialDisruption` and the rate of pod evictions is reduced. For small clusters (by default, 50 nodes or less) in this state, nodes in this zone are not tainted and evictions are stopped.

For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#rate-limits-on-eviction[Rate limits on eviction] in the Kubernetes documentation.
====

{product-title} automatically adds a toleration for `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` and `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` with `tolerationSeconds=300`, unless the `Pod` configuration specifies either toleration.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
#...
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoExecute
    tolerationSeconds: 300 <1>
  - key: node.kubernetes.io/unreachable
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoExecute
    tolerationSeconds: 300
#...
----

<1> These tolerations ensure that the default pod behavior is to remain bound for five minutes after one of these node conditions problems is detected.

You can configure these tolerations as needed. For example, if you have an application with a lot of local state, you might want to keep the pods bound to node for a longer time in the event of network partition, allowing for the partition to recover and avoiding pod eviction.

Pods spawned by a daemon set are created with `NoExecute` tolerations for the following taints with no `tolerationSeconds`:

* `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable`
* `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready`

As a result, daemon set pods are never evicted because of these node conditions.

[id="nodes-scheduler-taints-tolerations-all_{context}"]
== Tolerating all taints

You can configure a pod to tolerate all taints by adding an `operator: "Exists"` toleration with no `key` and `values` parameters.

If you want ensure the pods are scheduled to only those tainted nodes, also add a label to the same set of nodes and add a node affinity to the pods so that the pods can only be scheduled onto nodes with that label.

.Procedure

To configure a node so that users can use only that node:

. Add a corresponding taint to those nodes:
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 dedicated=groupName:NoSchedule
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the taint:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Node
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-node
#...
spec:
  taints:
    - key: dedicated
      value: groupName
      effect: NoSchedule
#...
----
====

. Add a toleration to the pods by writing a custom admission controller.

= Controlling nodes with special hardware using taints and tolerations

In a cluster where a small subset of nodes have specialized hardware, you can use taints and tolerations to keep pods that do not need the specialized hardware off of those nodes, leaving the nodes for pods that do need the specialized hardware. You can also require pods that need specialized hardware to use specific nodes.

You can achieve this by adding a toleration to pods that need the special hardware and tainting the nodes that have the specialized hardware.

.Procedure

To ensure nodes with specialized hardware are reserved for specific pods:

. Add a toleration to pods that need the special hardware.

[id="topology_manager_policies_{context}"]
= Topology Manager policies

Topology Manager aligns `Pod` resources of all Quality of Service (QoS) classes by collecting topology hints from Hint Providers, such as CPU Manager and Device Manager, and using the collected hints to align the `Pod` resources.

Topology Manager supports four allocation policies, which you assign in the `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) named `cpumanager-enabled`:

`none` policy::

This is the default policy and does not perform any topology alignment.

`best-effort` policy::

For each container in a pod with the `best-effort` topology management policy, kubelet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource
availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager stores the preferred NUMA Node affinity for that container. If the affinity is not preferred, Topology Manager stores this and admits the pod to the node.

`restricted` policy::

For each container in a pod with the `restricted` topology management policy, kubelet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource
availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager stores the preferred NUMA Node affinity for that container. If the affinity is not
preferred, Topology Manager rejects this pod from the node, resulting in a pod in a `Terminated` state with a pod admission failure.

`single-numa-node` policy::

For each container in a pod with the `single-numa-node` topology management policy, kubelet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager determines if a single NUMA Node affinity is possible. If it is, the pod is admitted to the node. If a single NUMA Node affinity is not possible, the Topology Manager rejects the pod from the node. This results in a pod in a Terminated state with a pod admission failure.

[id="pod-interactions-with-topology-manager_{context}"]
= Pod interactions with Topology Manager policies

The example `Pod` specs below help illustrate pod interactions with Topology Manager.

The following pod runs in the `BestEffort` QoS class because no resource requests or limits are specified.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
----

The next pod runs in the `Burstable` QoS class because requests are less than limits.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
      requests:
        memory: "100Mi"
----

If the selected policy is anything other than `none`, Topology Manager would not consider either of these `Pod` specifications.

The last example pod below runs in the Guaranteed QoS class because requests are equal to limits.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
        example.com/device: "1"
      requests:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
        example.com/device: "1"
----

Topology Manager would consider this pod. The Topology Manager would consult the hint providers, which are CPU Manager and Device Manager, to get topology hints for the pod.

Topology Manager will use this information to store the best topology for this container. In the case of this pod, CPU Manager and Device Manager will use this stored information at the resource allocation stage.

[id="nodes-cluster-overcommit-resource-requests_{context}"]
= Resource requests and overcommitment

For each compute resource, a container may specify a resource request and limit.
Scheduling decisions are made based on the request to ensure that a node has
enough capacity available to meet the requested value. If a container specifies
limits, but omits requests, the requests are defaulted to the limits. A
container is not able to exceed the specified limit on the node.

The enforcement of limits is dependent upon the compute resource type. If a
container makes no request or limit, the container is scheduled to a node with
no resource guarantees. In practice, the container is able to consume as much of
the specified resource as is available with the lowest local priority. In low
resource situations, containers that specify no resource requests are given the
lowest quality of service.

Scheduling is based on resources requested, while quota and hard limits refer
to resource limits, which can be set higher than requested resources. The
difference between request and limit determines the level of overcommit;
for instance, if a container is given a memory request of 1Gi and a memory limit
of 2Gi, it is scheduled based on the 1Gi request being available on the node,
but could use up to 2Gi; so it is 200% overcommitted.

[id="nodes-cluster-resource-override_{context}"]
= Cluster-level overcommit using the Cluster Resource Override Operator

The Cluster Resource Override Operator is an admission webhook that allows you to control the level of overcommit and manage
container density across all the nodes in your cluster. The Operator controls how nodes in specific projects can exceed defined memory and CPU limits.

You must install the Cluster Resource Override Operator using the {product-title} console or CLI as shown in the following sections.
During the installation, you create a `ClusterResourceOverride` custom resource (CR), where you set the level of overcommit, as shown in the
following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.autoscaling.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterResourceOverride
metadata:
    name: cluster <1>
spec:
  podResourceOverride:
    spec:
      memoryRequestToLimitPercent: 50 <2>
      cpuRequestToLimitPercent: 25 <3>
      limitCPUToMemoryPercent: 200 <4>
# ...
----
<1> The name must be `cluster`.
<2> Optional. If a container memory limit has been specified or defaulted, the memory request is overridden to this percentage of the limit, between 1-100. The default is 50.
<3> Optional. If a container CPU limit has been specified or defaulted, the CPU request is overridden to this percentage of the limit, between 1-100. The default is 25.
<4> Optional. If a container memory limit has been specified or defaulted, the CPU limit is overridden to a percentage of the memory limit, if specified. Scaling 1Gi of RAM at 100 percent is equal to 1 CPU core. This is processed prior to overriding the CPU request (if configured). The default is 200.

[NOTE]
====
The Cluster Resource Override Operator overrides have no effect if limits have not
been set on containers. Create a `LimitRange` object with default limits per individual project
or configure limits in `Pod` specs for the overrides to apply.
====

When configured, overrides can be enabled per-project by applying the following
label to the Namespace object for each project:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:

# ...

  labels:
    clusterresourceoverrides.admission.autoscaling.openshift.io/enabled: "true"

# ...
----

The Operator watches for the `ClusterResourceOverride` CR and ensures that the `ClusterResourceOverride` admission webhook is installed into the same namespace as the operator.

A container is guaranteed the amount of CPU it requests and is additionally able
to consume excess CPU available on the node, up to any limit specified by the

distributed based on the amount of CPU requested by each container.

For example, if one container requested 500m of CPU time and another container
requested 250m of CPU time, then any extra CPU time available on the node is
distributed among the containers in a 2:1 ratio. If a container specified a
limit, it will be throttled not to use more CPU than the specified limit.
CPU requests are enforced using the CFS shares support in the Linux kernel. By
default, CPU limits are enforced using the CFS quota support in the Linux kernel
over a 100ms measuring interval, though this can be disabled.

[id="understanding-memory-requests-container_{context}"]
== Understanding container memory requests

A container is guaranteed the amount of memory it requests. A container can use
more memory than requested, but once it exceeds its requested amount, it could
be terminated in a low memory situation on the node.
If a container uses less memory than requested, it will not be terminated unless
system tasks or daemons need more memory than was accounted for in the node's
resource reservation. If a container specifies a limit on memory, it is
immediately terminated if it exceeds the limit amount.

The {product-title} cluster uses ephemeral storage to store information that does not have to persist after the cluster is destroyed.
====

A container is guaranteed the amount of ephemeral storage it requests. A
container can use more ephemeral storage than requested, but once it exceeds its

too low.

If a container uses less ephemeral storage than requested, it will not be
terminated unless system tasks or daemons need more local ephemeral storage than
was accounted for in the node's resource reservation. If a container specifies a
limit on ephemeral storage, it is immediately terminated if it exceeds the limit
amount.

[id="nodes-cluster-overcommit-qos-about_{context}"]
= Understanding overcomitment and quality of service classes

A node is _overcommitted_ when it has a pod scheduled that makes no request, or
when the sum of limits across all pods on that node exceeds available machine
capacity.

In an overcommitted environment, it is possible that the pods on the node will
attempt to use more compute resource than is available at any given point in
time. When this occurs, the node must give priority to one pod over another. The
facility used to make this decision is referred to as a Quality of Service (QoS)
Class.

A pod is designated as one of three QoS classes with decreasing order of priority:

.Quality of Service Classes
[options="header",cols="1,1,5"]
|===
|Priority |Class Name |Description

|1 (highest)
|*Guaranteed*
|If limits and optionally requests are set (not equal to 0) for all resources
and they are equal, then the pod is classified as *Guaranteed*.

|2
|*Burstable*
|If requests and optionally limits are set (not equal to 0) for all resources,
and they are not equal, then the pod is classified as *Burstable*.

|3 (lowest)
|*BestEffort*
|If requests and limits are not set for any of the resources, then the pod
is classified as *BestEffort*.
|===

Memory is an incompressible resource, so in low memory situations, containers
that have the lowest priority are terminated first:

- *Guaranteed* containers are considered top priority, and are guaranteed to
only be terminated if they exceed their limits, or if the system is under memory
pressure and there are no lower priority containers that can be evicted.
- *Burstable* containers under system memory pressure are more likely to be
terminated once they exceed their requests and no other *BestEffort* containers
exist.
- *BestEffort* containers are treated with the lowest priority. Processes in
these containers are first to be terminated if the system runs out of memory.

[id="qos-about-reserve_{context}"]
== Understanding how to reserve memory across quality of service tiers

You can use the `qos-reserved` parameter to specify a percentage of memory to be reserved
by a pod in a particular QoS level. This feature attempts to reserve requested resources to exclude pods
from lower OoS classes from using resources requested by pods in higher QoS classes.

{product-title} uses the `qos-reserved` parameter as follows:

- A value of `qos-reserved=memory=100%` will prevent the `Burstable` and `BestEffort` QoS classes from consuming memory
that was requested by a higher QoS class. This increases the risk of inducing OOM
on `BestEffort` and `Burstable` workloads in favor of increasing memory resource guarantees
for `Guaranteed` and `Burstable` workloads.

- A value of `qos-reserved=memory=50%` will allow the `Burstable` and `BestEffort` QoS classes
to consume half of the memory requested by a higher QoS class.

- A value of `qos-reserved=memory=0%`
will allow a `Burstable` and `BestEffort` QoS classes to consume up to the full node
allocatable amount if available, but increases the risk that a `Guaranteed` workload
will not have access to requested memory. This condition effectively disables this feature.

[id="nodes-qos-about-swap_{context}"]
= Understanding swap memory and QOS

You can disable swap by default on your nodes to preserve quality of
service (QOS) guarantees. Otherwise, physical resources on a node can oversubscribe,
affecting the resource guarantees the Kubernetes scheduler makes during pod
placement.

For example, if two guaranteed pods have reached their memory limit, each
container could start using swap memory. Eventually, if there is not enough swap
space, processes in the pods can be terminated due to the system being
oversubscribed.

Failing to disable swap results in nodes not recognizing that they are
experiencing *MemoryPressure*, resulting in pods not receiving the memory they
made in their scheduling request. As a result, additional pods are placed on the
node to further increase memory pressure, ultimately increasing your risk of
experiencing a system out of memory (OOM) event.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If swap is enabled, any out-of-resource handling eviction thresholds for available memory will not work as
expected. Take advantage of out-of-resource handling to allow pods to be evicted
from a node when it is under memory pressure, and rescheduled on an alternative
node that has no such pressure.

[id="nodes-cluster-overcommit-configure-nodes_{context}"]
= Understanding nodes overcommitment

In an overcommitted environment, it is important to properly configure your node to provide best system behavior.

When the node starts, it ensures that the kernel tunable flags for memory
management are set properly. The kernel should never fail memory allocations
unless it runs out of physical memory.

To ensure this behavior, {product-title} configures the kernel to always overcommit
memory by setting the `vm.overcommit_memory` parameter to `1`, overriding the
default operating system setting.

{product-title} also configures the kernel not to panic when it runs out of memory
by setting the `vm.panic_on_oom` parameter to `0`. A setting of 0 instructs the
kernel to call oom_killer in an Out of Memory (OOM) condition, which kills
processes based on priority

You can view the current setting by running the following commands on your nodes:

[source,terminal]
----
$ sysctl -a |grep commit
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
#...
vm.overcommit_memory = 0
#...
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ sysctl -a |grep panic
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
#...
vm.panic_on_oom = 0
#...
----

[NOTE]
====
The above flags should already be set on nodes, and no further action is
required.
====

You can also perform the following configurations for each node:

* Disable or enforce CPU limits using CPU CFS quotas

* Reserve resources for system processes

* Reserve memory across quality of service tiers

= Disabling or enforcing CPU limits using CPU CFS quotas

Nodes by default enforce specified CPU limits using the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) quota support in the Linux kernel.

If you disable CPU limit enforcement, it is important to understand the impact on your node:

* If a container has a CPU request, the request continues to be enforced by CFS shares in the Linux kernel.
* If a container does not have a CPU request, but does have a CPU limit, the CPU request defaults to the specified CPU limit, and is enforced by CFS shares in the Linux kernel.
* If a container has both a CPU request and limit, the CPU request is enforced by CFS shares in the Linux kernel, and the CPU limit has no impact on the node.

To provide more reliable scheduling and minimize node resource overcommitment,
each node can reserve a portion of its resources for use by system daemons
that are required to run on your node for your cluster to function.
In particular, it is recommended that you reserve resources for incompressible resources such as memory.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="nodes-nodes-garbage-collection-containers_{context}"]
= Understanding how terminated containers are removed through garbage collection

Container garbage collection removes terminated containers by using eviction thresholds.

When eviction thresholds are set for garbage collection, the node tries to keep any container for any pod accessible from the API. If the pod has been deleted, the containers will be as well. Containers are preserved as long the pod is not deleted and the eviction threshold is not reached. If the node is under disk pressure, it will remove containers and their logs will no longer be accessible using `oc logs`.

* *eviction-soft* - A soft eviction threshold pairs an eviction threshold with a required administrator-specified grace period.

* *eviction-hard* - A hard eviction threshold has no grace period, and if observed, {product-title} takes immediate action.

The following table lists the eviction thresholds:

.Variables for configuring container garbage collection
|===
| Node condition | Eviction signal | Description

| MemoryPressure
| `memory.available`
| The available memory on the node.

| DiskPressure
a| * `nodefs.available`
  * `nodefs.inodesFree`
  * `imagefs.available`
  * `imagefs.inodesFree`
| The available disk space or inodes on the node root file system, `nodefs`, or image file system, `imagefs`.
|===

[NOTE]
====
For `evictionHard` you must specify all of these parameters.  If you do not specify all parameters, only the specified parameters are applied and the garbage collection will not function properly.
====

If a node is oscillating above and below a soft eviction threshold, but not exceeding its associated grace period, the corresponding node would constantly oscillate between `true` and `false`. As a consequence, the scheduler could make poor scheduling decisions.

To protect against this oscillation, use the `eviction-pressure-transition-period` flag to control how long {product-title} must wait before transitioning out of a pressure condition. {product-title} will not set an eviction threshold as being met for the specified pressure condition for the period specified before toggling the condition back to false.

[id="nodes-nodes-garbage-collection-images_{context}"]
= Understanding how images are removed through garbage collection

Image garbage collection removes images that are not referenced by any running pods.

{product-title} determines which images to remove from a node based on the disk usage that is reported by *cAdvisor*.

The policy for image garbage collection is based on two conditions:

* The percent of disk usage (expressed as an integer) which triggers image
garbage collection. The default is *85*.

* The percent of disk usage (expressed as an integer) to which image garbage
collection attempts to free. Default is *80*.

For image garbage collection, you can modify any of the following variables using
a custom resource.

.Variables for configuring image garbage collection

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===

|Setting |Description

|`imageMinimumGCAge`
|The minimum age for an unused image before the image is removed by garbage collection. The default is *2m*.

|`imageGCHighThresholdPercent`
|The percent of disk usage, expressed as an integer, which triggers image
garbage collection. The default is *85*.

|`imageGCLowThresholdPercent`
|The percent of disk usage, expressed as an integer, to which image garbage
collection attempts to free. The default is *80*.
|===

Two lists of images are retrieved in each garbage collector run:

1. A list of images currently running in at least one pod.
2. A list of images available on a host.

As new containers are run, new images appear. All images are marked with a time
stamp. If the image is running (the first list above) or is newly detected (the
second list above), it is marked with the current time. The remaining images are
already marked from the previous spins. All images are then sorted by the time
stamp.

Once the collection starts, the oldest images get deleted first until the
stopping criterion is met.

[discrete]
== Purpose


The Node Tuning Operator helps you manage node-level tuning by orchestrating the TuneD daemon and achieves low latency performance by using the Performance Profile controller. The majority of high-performance applications require some level of kernel tuning. The Node Tuning Operator provides a unified management interface to users of node-level sysctls and more flexibility to add custom tuning specified by user needs.


The Operator manages the containerized TuneD daemon for {product-title} as a Kubernetes daemon set. It ensures the custom tuning specification is passed to all containerized TuneD daemons running in the cluster in the format that the daemons understand. The daemons run on all nodes in the cluster, one per node.

Node-level settings applied by the containerized TuneD daemon are rolled back on an event that triggers a profile change or when the containerized TuneD daemon is terminated gracefully by receiving and handling a termination signal.

The Node Tuning Operator uses the Performance Profile controller to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for {product-title} applications.

The cluster administrator configures a performance profile to define node-level settings such as the following:

* Updating the kernel to kernel-rt.
* Choosing CPUs for housekeeping.
* Choosing CPUs for running workloads.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, disabling CPU load balancing is not supported by cgroup v2. As a result, you might not get the desired behavior from performance profiles if you have cgroup v2 enabled. Enabling cgroup v2 is not recommended if you are using performance profiles.
====

The Node Tuning Operator is part of a standard {product-title} installation in version 4.1 and later.

[NOTE]
====
In earlier versions of {product-title}, the Performance Addon Operator was used to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for OpenShift applications. In {product-title} 4.11 and later, this functionality is part of the Node Tuning Operator.

The default CR is meant for delivering standard node-level tuning for the {product-title} platform and it can only be modified to set the Operator Management state. Any other custom changes to the default CR will be overwritten by the Operator. For custom tuning, create your own Tuned CRs. Newly created CRs will be combined with the default CR and custom tuning applied to {product-title} nodes based on node or pod labels and profile priorities.

[WARNING]
====
While in certain situations the support for pod labels can be a convenient way of automatically delivering required tuning, this practice is discouraged and strongly advised against, especially in large-scale clusters. The default Tuned CR ships without pod label matching. If a custom profile is created with pod label matching, then the functionality will be enabled at that time. The pod label functionality will be deprecated in future versions of the Node Tuning Operator.

[id="custom-tuning-specification_{context}"]
= Custom tuning specification

The custom resource (CR) for the Operator has two major sections. The first section, `profile:`, is a list of TuneD profiles and their names. The second, `recommend:`, defines the profile selection logic.

Multiple custom tuning specifications can co-exist as multiple CRs in the Operator's namespace. The existence of new CRs or the deletion of old CRs is detected by the Operator. All existing custom tuning specifications are merged and appropriate objects for the containerized TuneD daemons are updated.

*Management state*

The Operator Management state is set by adjusting the default Tuned CR. By default, the Operator is in the Managed state and the `spec.managementState` field is not present in the default Tuned CR. Valid values for the Operator Management state are as follows:

  * Managed: the Operator will update its operands as configuration resources are updated
  * Unmanaged: the Operator will ignore changes to the configuration resources
  * Removed: the Operator will remove its operands and resources the Operator provisioned

*Profile data*

The `profile:` section lists TuneD profiles and their names.

<9> Turn `reapply_sysctl` functionality on or off for the TuneD daemon. Options are `true` for on and `false` for off.

`<match>` is an optional list recursively defined as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
- label: <label_name> <1>
  value: <label_value> <2>
  type: <label_type> <3>
    <match> <4>
----
<1> Node or pod label name.
<2> Optional node or pod label value. If omitted, the presence of `<label_name>` is enough to match.
<3> Optional object type (`node` or `pod`). If omitted, `node` is assumed.
<4> An optional `<match>` list.

If `<match>` is not omitted, all nested `<match>` sections must also evaluate to `true`. Otherwise, `false` is assumed and the profile with the respective `<match>` section will not be applied or recommended. Therefore, the nesting (child `<match>` sections) works as logical AND operator. Conversely, if any item of the `<match>` list matches, the entire `<match>` list evaluates to `true`. Therefore, the list acts as logical OR operator.

If `machineConfigLabels` is defined, machine config pool based matching is turned on for the given `recommend:` list item. `<mcLabels>` specifies the labels for a machine config. The machine config is created automatically to apply host settings, such as kernel boot parameters, for the profile `<tuned_profile_name>`. This involves finding all machine config pools with machine config selector matching `<mcLabels>` and setting the profile `<tuned_profile_name>` on all nodes that are assigned the found machine config pools. To target nodes that have both master and worker roles, you must use the master role.

The list items `match` and `machineConfigLabels` are connected by the logical OR operator. The `match` item is evaluated first in a short-circuit manner. Therefore, if it evaluates to `true`, the `machineConfigLabels` item is not considered.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using machine config pool based matching, it is advised to group nodes with the same hardware configuration into the same machine config pool. Not following this practice might result in TuneD operands calculating conflicting kernel parameters for two or more nodes sharing the same machine config pool.
====

.Example: node or pod label based matching

[source,yaml]
----
- match:
  - label: tuned.openshift.io/elasticsearch
    match:
    - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
    type: pod
  priority: 10
  profile: openshift-control-plane-es
- match:
  - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
  - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
  priority: 20
  profile: openshift-control-plane
- priority: 30
  profile: openshift-node
----

The CR above is translated for the containerized TuneD daemon into its `recommend.conf` file based on the profile priorities. The profile with the highest priority (`10`) is `openshift-control-plane-es` and, therefore, it is considered first. The containerized TuneD daemon running on a given node looks to see if there is a pod running on the same node with the `tuned.openshift.io/elasticsearch` label set. If not, the entire `<match>` section evaluates as `false`. If there is such a pod with the label, in order for the `<match>` section to evaluate to `true`, the node label also needs to be `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` or `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra`.

If the labels for the profile with priority `10` matched, `openshift-control-plane-es` profile is applied and no other profile is considered. If the node/pod label combination did not match, the second highest priority profile (`openshift-control-plane`) is considered. This profile is applied if the containerized TuneD pod runs on a node with labels `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` or `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra`.

Finally, the profile `openshift-node` has the lowest priority of `30`. It lacks the `<match>` section and, therefore, will always match. It acts as a profile catch-all to set `openshift-node` profile, if no other profile with higher priority matches on a given node.

*Cloud provider-specific TuneD profiles*

With this functionality, all Cloud provider-specific nodes can conveniently be assigned a TuneD profile specifically tailored to a given Cloud provider on a {product-title} cluster. This can be accomplished without adding additional node labels or grouping nodes into machine config pools.

This functionality takes advantage of `spec.providerID` node object values in the form of `<cloud-provider>://<cloud-provider-specific-id>` and writes the file `/var/lib/tuned/provider` with the value `<cloud-provider>` in NTO operand containers.  The content of this file is then used by TuneD to load `provider-<cloud-provider>` profile if such profile exists.

The `openshift` profile that both `openshift-control-plane` and `openshift-node` profiles inherit settings from is now updated to use this functionality through the use of conditional profile loading. Neither NTO nor TuneD currently include any Cloud provider-specific profiles. However, it is possible to create a custom profile `provider-<cloud-provider>` that will be applied to all Cloud provider-specific cluster nodes.

= Configuring the maximum number of pods per node

Two parameters control the maximum number of pods that can be scheduled to a node: `podsPerCore` and `maxPods`. If you use both options, the lower of the two limits the number of pods on a node.

For example, if `podsPerCore` is set to `10` on a node with 4 processor cores, the maximum number of pods allowed on the node will be 40.

.Prerequisites

. Obtain the label associated with the static `MachineConfigPool` CRD for the type of node you want to configure by entering the following command:

After you configure a machine set to request a static IP address for a machine, the machine controller creates an `IPAddressClaim` resource in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace. The external controller then creates an `IPAddress` resource and binds any static IP addresses to the `IPAddressClaim` resource.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Your organization might use numerous types of IP address management (IPAM) services. If you want to enable a particular IPAM service on {product-title}, you might need to manually create the `IPAddressClaim` resource in a YAML definition and then bind a static IP address to this resource by entering the following command in your `oc` CLI:

[source, terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <ipaddressclaim_filename>
----
====

The following demonstrates an example of an `IPAddressClaim` resource:

[source, yaml]
----
kind: IPAddressClaim
metadata:

spec:
  poolRef:
    apiGroup: ipamcontroller.example.io
    kind: IPPool
    name: static-ci-pool
status: {}
----

The machine controller updates the machine with a status of `IPAddressClaimed` to indicate that a static IP address has succesfully bound to the `IPAddressClaim` resource. The machine controller applies the same status to a machine with multiple `IPAddressClaim` resources that each contain a bound static IP address.The machine controller then creates a virtual machine and applies static IP addresses to any nodes listed in the `providerSpec` of a machine's configuration.

The machine controller accesses static IP addresses listed in the machine set's configuration and then allocates each address to each machine.
<2> Lists a nameserver. You must specify a nameserver for nodes that receive static IP address, because the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) network configuration does not support static IP addresses.

. Scale the machine set by entering the following commands in your `oc` CLI:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Or:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
After each machine is scaled up, the machine controller creates an `IPAddresssClaim` resource.

. Optional: Check that the `IPAddressClaim` resource exists in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace by entering the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get ipaddressclaims.ipam.cluster.x-k8s.io -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
.Example `oc` CLI output that lists two IP pools listed in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace
[source, terminal]
----
NAME                                         POOL NAME        POOL KIND
cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-claim-0-0   static-ci-pool   IPPool
cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-wdqkt-claim-0-0   static-ci-pool   IPPool
----

. Create an `IPAddress` resource by entering the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc create -f ipaddress.yaml
----
+
The following example shows an `IPAddress` resource with defined network configuration information and one defined static IP address:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ipam.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: IPAddress
metadata:
  name: cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-ipaddress-0-0
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
  address: 192.168.204.129
  claimRef: <1>
    name: cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-claim-0-0
  gateway: 192.168.204.1
  poolRef: <2>
    apiGroup: ipamcontroller.example.io
    kind: IPPool
    name: static-ci-pool
  prefix: 23
----
<1> The name of the target `IPAddressClaim` resource.
<2> Details information about the static IP address or addresses from your nodes.
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, the external controller automatically scans any resources in the machine set for recognizable address pool types. When the external controller finds `kind: IPPool` defined in the `IPAddress` resource, the controller binds any static IP addresses to the `IPAddressClaim` resource.
====

. Update the `IPAddressClaim` status with a reference to the `IPAddress` resource:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc --type=merge patch IPAddressClaim cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-claim-0-0 -p='{"status":{"addressRef": {"name": "cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-ipaddress-0-0"}}}' -n openshift-machine-api --subresource=status
