{productwinc} provides built-in support for running Microsoft Windows Server containers on {product-title}. For those that administer heterogeneous environments with a mix of Linux and Windows workloads, {product-title} allows you to deploy Windows workloads running on Windows Server containers while also providing traditional Linux workloads hosted on {op-system-first} or {op-system-base-full}.

[NOTE]
====
Multi-tenancy for clusters that have Windows nodes is not supported. Hostile multi-tenant usage introduces security concerns in all Kubernetes environments. Additional security features like link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/[pod security policies], or more fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) for nodes, make exploits more difficult. However, if you choose to run hostile multi-tenant workloads, a hypervisor is the only security option you should use. The security domain for Kubernetes encompasses the entire cluster, not an individual node. For these types of hostile multi-tenant workloads, you should use physically isolated clusters.

Windows Server Containers provide resource isolation using a shared kernel but are not intended to be used in hostile multitenancy scenarios. Scenarios that involve hostile multitenancy should use Hyper-V Isolated Containers to strongly isolate tenants.

== Supported networking

Hybrid networking with OVN-Kubernetes is the only supported networking configuration. See the additional resources below for more information on this functionality. The following tables outline the type of networking configuration and Windows Server versions to use based on your platform. You must specify the network configuration when you install the cluster.

[NOTE]

The WMCO does not support OVN-Kubernetes without hybrid networking or OpenShift SDN.

[id="windows-workload-management_{context}"]
= Windows workload management

To run Windows workloads in your cluster, you must first install the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO). The WMCO is a Linux-based Operator that runs on Linux-based control plane and compute nodes. The WMCO orchestrates the process of deploying and managing Windows workloads on a cluster.

.WMCO design
image::wmco-design.png[WMCO workflow]

Before deploying Windows workloads, you must create a Windows compute node and have it join the cluster. The Windows node hosts the Windows workloads in a cluster, and can run alongside other Linux-based compute nodes. You can create a Windows compute node by creating a Windows compute machine set to host Windows Server compute machines. You must apply a Windows-specific label to the compute machine set that specifies a Windows OS image.

The WMCO watches for machines with the Windows label. After a Windows compute machine set is detected and its respective machines are provisioned, the WMCO configures the underlying Windows virtual machine (VM) so that it can join the cluster as a compute node.

.Mixed Windows and Linux workloads
image::mixed-windows-linux-workloads.png[Mixed Windows and Linux workloads]

The WMCO expects a predetermined secret in its namespace containing a private key that is used to interact with the Windows instance. WMCO checks for this secret during boot up time and creates a user data secret which you must reference in the Windows `MachineSet` object that you created. Then the WMCO populates the user data secret with a public key that corresponds to the private key. With this data in place, the cluster can connect to the Windows VM using an SSH connection.

After the cluster establishes a connection with the Windows VM, you can manage the Windows node using similar practices as you would a Linux-based node.

[NOTE]
====
The {product-title} web console provides most of the same monitoring capabilities for Windows nodes that are available for Linux nodes. However, the ability to monitor workload graphs for pods running on Windows nodes is not available at this time.
====

Scheduling Windows workloads to a Windows node can be done with typical pod scheduling practices like taints, tolerations, and node selectors; alternatively, you can differentiate your Windows workloads from Linux workloads and other Windows-versioned workloads by using a `RuntimeClass` object.

[id="windows-containers-release-notes-limitations_{context}"]
= Known limitations

Note the following limitations when working with Windows nodes managed by the WMCO (Windows nodes):

* The following {product-title} features are not supported on Windows nodes:
// ** Red Hat OpenShift Developer CLI (odo)
** Image builds
** OpenShift Pipelines
** OpenShift Service Mesh
** OpenShift monitoring of user-defined projects
** {ServerlessProductName}
** Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
** Vertical Pod Autoscaling

* The following Red Hat features are not supported on Windows nodes:
** link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/cost_management_service/2022/html/getting_started_with_cost_management/assembly-introduction-cost-management?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001OH74AAG#about-cost-management_getting-started[Red Hat cost management]
** link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Local]

* Windows nodes do not support pulling container images from private registries. You can use images from public registries or pre-pull the images.

* Windows nodes do not support workloads created by using deployment configs. You can use a deployment or other method to deploy workloads.

* Windows nodes are not supported in clusters that use a cluster-wide proxy. This is because the WMCO is not able to route traffic through the proxy connection for the workloads.

* Windows nodes are not supported in clusters that are in a disconnected environment.

* {productwinc} does not support adding Windows nodes to a cluster through a trunk port. The only supported networking configuration for adding Windows nodes is through an access port that carries traffic for the VLAN.

* {productwinc} supports only in-tree storage drivers for all cloud providers.

* Kubernetes has identified the following link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/windows/intro/#limitations[node feature limitations] :
** Huge pages are not supported for Windows containers.
** Privileged containers are not supported for Windows containers.

* Kubernetes has identified link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/windows/intro/#api[several API compatibility issues].
