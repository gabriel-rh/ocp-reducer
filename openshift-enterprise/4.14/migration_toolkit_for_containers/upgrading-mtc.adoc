You can upgrade the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) on {product-title} {product-version} by using Operator Lifecycle Manager.

You can upgrade {mtc-short} on {product-title} 4.5, and earlier versions, by reinstalling the legacy {mtc-full} Operator.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading from {mtc-short} version 1.3, you must perform an additional procedure to update the `MigPlan` custom resource (CR).

= Upgrading the {mtc-full} on {product-title} {product-version}

You can upgrade the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) on {product-title} {product-version} by using the Operator Lifecycle Manager.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When upgrading the {mtc-short} by using the Operator Lifecycle Manager, you must use a supported migration path.
====

.Migration paths
* Migrating from {product-title} 3 to {product-title} 4 requires a legacy {mtc-short} Operator and {mtc-short} 1.7.x.
* Migrating from {mtc-short} 1.7.x to {mtc-short} 1.8.x is not supported.
* You must use {mtc-short} 1.7.x to migrate anything with a source of {product-title} 4.9 or earlier.
** {mtc-short} 1.7.x must be used on both source and destination.
* MTC 1.8.x only supports migrations from {product-title} 4.10 or later to {product-title} 4.10 or later. For migrations only involving cluster versions 4.10 and later, either 1.7.x or 1.8.x may be used. However, it must be the same MTC version on both source & destination.
** Migration from source {mtc-short} 1.7.x to destination {mtc-short} 1.8.x is unsupported.
** Migration from source {mtc-short} 1.8.x to destination {mtc-short} 1.7.x is unsupported.
** Migration from source {mtc-short} 1.7.x to destination {mtc-short} 1.7.x is supported.
** Migration from source {mtc-short} 1.8.x to destination {mtc-short} 1.8.x is supported

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
+
Operators that have a pending upgrade display an *Upgrade available* status.

. Click *{mtc-full} Operator*.
. Click the *Subscription* tab. Any upgrades requiring approval are displayed next to *Upgrade Status*. For example, it might display *1 requires approval*.
. Click *1 requires approval*, then click *Preview Install Plan*.
. Review the resources that are listed as available for upgrade and click *Approve*.
. Navigate back to the *Operators -> Installed Operators* page to monitor the progress of the upgrade. When complete, the status changes to *Succeeded* and *Up to date*.
. Click *Workloads* -> *Pods* to verify that the {mtc-short} pods are running.

= Upgrading the {mtc-full} on {product-title} versions 4.2 to 4.5

You can upgrade {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) on {product-title} versions 4.2 to 4.5 by manually installing the legacy {mtc-full} Operator.

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You must have access to `registry.redhat.io`.
* You must have `podman` installed.

.Procedure

. Log in to `registry.redhat.io` with your Red Hat Customer Portal credentials by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
----

. Download the `operator.yml` file by entering the following command:

----
$ podman cp $(podman create \
  registry.redhat.io/rhmtc/openshift-migration-legacy-rhel8-operator:v{mtc-version}):/operator.yml ./
----

. Replace the {mtc-full} Operator by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc replace --force -f operator.yml
----

. Scale the `migration-operator` deployment to `0` to stop the deployment by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale -n openshift-migration --replicas=0 deployment/migration-operator
----

. Scale the `migration-operator` deployment to `1` to start the deployment and apply the changes by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale -n openshift-migration --replicas=1 deployment/migration-operator
----

. Verify that the `migration-operator` was upgraded by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -o yaml -n openshift-migration get deployment/migration-operator | grep image: | awk -F ":" '{ print $NF }'
----

. Download the `controller.yml` file by entering the following command:

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="migration-upgrading-from-mtc-1-3_{context}"]
= Upgrading {mtc-short} 1.3 to {mtc-version}

If you are upgrading {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) version 1.3.x to {mtc-version}, you must update the `MigPlan` custom resource (CR) manifest on the cluster on which the `MigrationController` pod is running.

Because the `indirectImageMigration` and `indirectVolumeMigration` parameters do not exist in {mtc-short} 1.3, their default value in version 1.4 is `false`, which means that direct image migration and direct volume migration are enabled. Because the direct migration requirements are not fulfilled, the migration plan cannot reach a `Ready` state unless these parameter values are changed to `true`.

[IMPORTANT]

====
* Migrating from {product-title} 3 to {product-title} 4 requires a legacy {mtc-short} Operator and {mtc-short} 1.7.x.
* Upgrading MTC 1.7.x to 1.8.x requires manually updating the OADP channel from `stable-1.0` to `stable-1.2` in order to successfully complete the upgrade from 1.7.x to 1.8.x.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Log in to the cluster on which the `MigrationController` pod is running.
. Get the `MigPlan` CR manifest:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get migplan <migplan> -o yaml -n openshift-migration
----

. Update the following parameter values and save the file as `migplan.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  indirectImageMigration: true
  indirectVolumeMigration: true
----

. Replace the `MigPlan` CR manifest to apply the changes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc replace -f migplan.yaml -n openshift-migration
----

. Get the updated `MigPlan` CR manifest to verify the changes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get migplan <migplan> -o yaml -n openshift-migration
