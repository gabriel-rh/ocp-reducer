OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) features provide options for backing up and restoring applications.

The default plugins enable Velero to integrate with certain cloud providers and to back up and restore {product-title} resources.

:_mod-docs-content-type: CONCEPT
[id="oadp-features_{context}"]
= OADP features

OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) supports the following features:

Backup::
You can use OADP to back up all applications on the OpenShift Platform, or you can filter the resources by type, namespace, or label.
+
OADP backs up Kubernetes objects and internal images by saving them as an archive file on object storage. OADP backs up persistent volumes (PVs) by creating snapshots with the native cloud snapshot API or with the Container Storage Interface (CSI). For cloud providers that do not support snapshots, OADP backs up resources and PV data with Restic.

+
[NOTE]
====
You must exclude Operators from the backup of an application for backup and restore to succeed.
====


Restore::
You can restore resources and PVs from a backup. You can restore all objects in a backup or filter the objects by namespace, PV, or label.

+
[NOTE]
====
You must exclude Operators from the backup of an application for backup and restore to succeed.
====

Schedule::
You can schedule backups at specified intervals.

Hooks::
You can use hooks to run commands in a container on a pod, for example, `fsfreeze` to freeze a file system. You can configure a hook to run before or after a backup or restore. Restore hooks can run in an init container or in the application container.

= OADP plugins

The {oadp-first} provides default Velero plugins that are integrated with storage providers to support backup and snapshot operations. You can create link:https://{velero-domain}/docs/v{velero-version}/custom-plugins/[custom plugins] based on the Velero plugins.

OADP also provides plugins for {product-title} resource backups, OpenShift Virtualization resource backups, and Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.

2. Virtual machine disks are backed up with CSI snapshots or Restic.
3. The `csi` plugin uses the link:https://velero.io/docs/main/csi/[Velero CSI beta snapshot API].

= About OADP Velero plugins

You can configure two types of plugins when you install Velero:

* Default cloud provider plugins
* Custom plugins

Both types of plugin are optional, but most users configure at least one cloud provider plugin.

== Default Velero cloud provider plugins

You can install any of the following default Velero cloud provider plugins when you configure the `oadp_v1alpha1_dpa.yaml` file during deployment:

* `aws` (Amazon Web Services)
* `gcp` (Google Cloud Platform)
* `azure` (Microsoft Azure)
* `openshift` (OpenShift Velero plugin)
* `csi` (Container Storage Interface)
* `kubevirt` (KubeVirt)

You specify the desired default plugins in the `oadp_v1alpha1_dpa.yaml` file during deployment.

.Example file

The following `.yaml` file installs the `openshift`, `aws`, `azure`, and `gcp` plugins:

[source,yaml]
----
 apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
 kind: DataProtectionApplication
 metadata:
   name: dpa-sample
 spec:
   configuration:
     velero:
       defaultPlugins:
       - openshift
       - aws
       - azure
       - gcp
----

== Custom Velero plugins

You can install a custom Velero plugin by specifying the plugin `image` and `name` when you configure the `oadp_v1alpha1_dpa.yaml` file during deployment.

You specify the desired custom plugins in the `oadp_v1alpha1_dpa.yaml` file during deployment.

.Example file

The following `.yaml` file installs the default `openshift`, `azure`, and `gcp` plugins and a custom plugin that has the name `custom-plugin-example` and the image `quay.io/example-repo/custom-velero-plugin`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:

 configuration:

     defaultPlugins:

{oadp-first} supports the following architectures:

* AMD64
* ARM64
* PPC64le
* s390x

[NOTE]
====
OADP 1.2.0 and later versions support the ARM64 architecture.

== OADP support for IBM Power and {ibmzProductName}

OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) is platform neutral. The information that follows relates only to IBM Power and to {ibmzProductName}.

OADP 1.1.0 was tested successfully against {product-title} 4.11 for both IBM Power and {ibmzProductName}. The sections that follow give testing and support information for OADP 1.1.0 in terms of backup locations for these systems.

IBM Power running with {product-title} 4.11 and 4.12, and OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.1.2 was tested successfully against an AWS S3 backup location target. Although the test involved only an AWS S3 target, Red Hat supports running IBM Power with {product-title} 4.11 and 4.12, and OADP 1.1.2 against all non-AWS S3 backup location targets as well.
