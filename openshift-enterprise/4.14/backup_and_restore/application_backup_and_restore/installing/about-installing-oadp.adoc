====
Starting from OADP 1.0.4, all OADP 1.0._z_ versions can only be used as a dependency of the MTC Operator and are not available as a standalone Operator.
====

To back up Kubernetes resources and internal images, you must have object storage as a backup location, such as one of the following storage types:

You can back up persistent volumes (PVs) by using snapshots or Restic.

To back up PVs with snapshots, you must have a cloud provider that supports either a native snapshot API or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots, such as one of the following cloud providers:

[NOTE]
====
If you want to use CSI backup on OCP 4.11 and later, install OADP 1.1._x_.

OADP 1.0._x_ does not support CSI backup on OCP 4.11 and later. OADP 1.0._x_ includes Velero 1.7._x_ and expects the API group `snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1`, which is not present on OCP 4.11 and later.
====

If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your storage is NFS, you can back up applications with xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/oadp-backing-up-applications-restic-doc.adoc#backing-up-applications[Restic backups] on object storage.

You create a default `Secret` and then you install the Data Protection Application.

[id="about-oadp-update-channels_{context}"]
= About OADP update channels

When you install an OADP Operator, you choose an _update channel_. This channel determines which upgrades to the OADP Operator and to Velero you receive. You can switch channels at any time.

The following update channels are available:

* The *stable* channel is now deprecated. The *stable* channel contains the patches (z-stream updates) of OADP `ClusterServiceVersion` for `oadp.v1.1.z` and older versions from `oadp.v1.0.z`.

* The *stable-1.0* channel contains `oadp.v1.0._z_`, the most recent OADP 1.0 `ClusterServiceVersion`.

* The *stable-1.1* channel contains `oadp.v1.1._z_`, the most recent OADP 1.1 `ClusterServiceVersion`.

* The *stable-1.2* channel contains `oadp.v1.2._z_`, the most recent OADP 1.2 `ClusterServiceVersion`.

*Which update channel is right for you?*

* The *stable* channel is now deprecated.  If you are already using the stable channel, you will continue to get updates from `oadp.v1.1._z_`.

* Choose the *stable-1._y_* update channel to install OADP 1._y_ and to continue receiving patches for it. If you choose this channel, you will receive all z-stream patches for version 1._y_._z_.

*When must you switch update channels?*

* If you have OADP 1._y_ installed, and you want to receive patches only for that y-stream, you must switch from the *stable* update channel to the *stable-1._y_* update channel. You will then receive all z-stream patches for version 1._y_._z_.

* If you have OADP 1.0 installed, want to upgrade to OADP 1.1, and then receive patches only for OADP 1.1, you must switch from the *stable-1.0* update channel to the *stable-1.1* update channel. You will then receive all z-stream patches for version 1.1._z_.

* If you have OADP 1._y_ installed, with _y_ greater than 0, and want to switch to OADP 1.0, you must _uninstall_ your OADP Operator and then reinstall it using the *stable-1.0* update channel. You will then receive all z-stream patches for version 1.0._z_.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot switch from OADP 1._y_ to OADP 1.0 by switching update channels. You must uninstall the Operator and then reinstall it.

[id="about-installing-oadp-on-multiple-namespaces_{context}"]
= Installation of OADP on multiple namespaces

You can install OADP into multiple namespaces on the same cluster so that multiple project owners can manage their own OADP instance. This use case has been validated with Restic and CSI.

You install each instance of OADP as specified by the per-platform procedures contained in this document with the following additional requirements:

* All deployments of OADP on the same cluster must be the same version, for example, 1.1.4. Installing different versions of OADP on the same cluster is *not* supported.
* Each individual deployment of OADP must have a unique set of credentials and a unique `BackupStorageLocation` configuration.
* By default, each OADP deployment has cluster-level access across namespaces. {product-title} administrators need to review security and RBAC settings carefully and make any necessary changes to them to ensure that each OADP instance has the correct permissions.

= Velero CPU and memory requirements based on collected data

The following recommendations are based on observations of performance made in the scale and performance lab. The backup and restore resources can be impacted by the type of plugin, the amount of resources required by that backup or restore, and the respective data contained in the persistent volumes (PVs) related to those resources.


== CPU and memory requirement for configurations
|===
|Configuration types | ^[1]^ Average usage |^[2]^ Large usage |resourceTimeouts

--
1. Average usage - use these settings for most usage situations.

2. Large usage - use these settings for large usage situations, such as a large PV (500GB Usage), multiple namespaces (100+), or many pods within a single namespace (2000 pods+), and for optimal performance for backup and restore involving large datasets.

3. Restic resource usage corresponds to the amount of data, and type of data. For example, many small files or large amounts of data can cause Restic to utilize large amounts of resources. The https://velero.io/docs/v1.11/customize-installation/#customize-resource-requests-and-limits/[Velero] documentation references 500m as a supplied default, for most of our testing we found 200m request suitable with 1000m limit.  As cited in the Velero documentation, exact CPU and memory usage is dependent on the scale of files and directories, in addition to environmental limitations.

4. Increasing the CPU has a significant impact on improving backup and restore times.

5. DataMover - DataMover default resourceTimeout is 10m. Our tests show that for restoring a large PV (500GB usage), it is required to increase the resourceTimeout to 60m.
--

[NOTE]
====
The resource requirements listed throughout the guide are for average usage only. For large usage, adjust the settings as described in the table above.
