== Resolved issues

The following highlighted issues are resolved in OADP 1.2.3:


.Multiple HTTP/2 enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (Rapid Reset Attack)

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, the HTTP/2 protocol was susceptible to a denial of service attack because request cancellation could reset multiple streams quickly. The server had to set up and tear down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection. This resulted in a denial of service due to server resource consumption. For a list of all OADP issues associated with this CVE, see the following link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2868?filter=12421248[Jira list].

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-39325[CVE-2023-39325 (Rapid Reset Attack)].

== Resolved issues

The following highlighted issues are resolved in OADP 1.2.2:


.Restic restore partially failed due to a Pod Security standard

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, {OCP} 4.14 enforced a pod security admission (PSA) policy that hindered the readiness of pods during a Restic restore process.

This issue has been resolved in the release of OADP 1.2.2, and also OADP 1.1.6. Therefore, it is recommended that users upgrade to these releases.

For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting.html#oadp-restic-restore-failing-psa-policy_oadp-troubleshooting[Restic restore partially failing on OCP 4.14 due to changed PSA policy]. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2094[(OADP-2094)]


.Backup of an app with internal images partially failed with plugin panicked error

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, the backup of an application with internal images partially failed with plugin panicked error returned. The backup partially fails with this error in the Velero logs:

----

This issue has been resolved in OADP 1.2.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-1057[(OADP-1057)].


.ACM cluster restore was not functioning as expected due to restore order

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, ACM cluster restore was not functioning as expected due to restore order. ACM applications were removed and re-created on managed clusters after restore activation. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2505[(OADP-2505)]


.VM's using filesystemOverhead failed when backing up and restoring due to volume size mismatch

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, due to storage provider implementation choices, whenever there was a difference between the application persistent volume claims (PVCs) storage request and the snapshot size of the same PVC, VM's using filesystemOverhead failed when backing up and restoring. This issue has been resolved in the Data Mover of OADP 1.2.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2144[(OADP-2144)]


.OADP did not contain an option to set VolSync replication source prune interval

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, there was no option to set the VolSync replication source `pruneInterval`. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2052[(OADP-2052)]


.Possible pod volume backup failure if Velero was installed in multiple namespaces

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, there was a possibility of pod volume backup failure if Velero was installed in multiple namespaces. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2409[(OADP-2409)]


.Backup Storage Locations moved to unavailable phase when VSL uses custom secret

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, Backup Storage Locations moved to unavailable phase when Volume Snapshot Location used custom secret. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-1737[(OADP-1737)]

The following issues have been highlighted as known issues in the release of OADP 1.2.2:

.Must-gather command fails to remove ClusterRoleBinding resources

The `oc adm must-gather` command fails to remove `ClusterRoleBinding` resources, which are left on cluster due to admission webhook. Therefore, requests for the removal of the `ClusterRoleBinding` resources are denied. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2773[(OADP-27730)]

[source,terminal]
----
admission webhook "clusterrolebindings-validation.managed.openshift.io" denied the request: Deleting ClusterRoleBinding must-gather-p7vwj is not allowed

.DataMover Restic retain and prune policies do not work as expected

The retention and prune features provided by VolSync and Restic are not working as expected. Because there is no working option to set the prune interval on VolSync replication, you have to manage and prune remotely stored backups on S3 storage outside of OADP. For more details, see:

== Resolved issues

.Restic restore partially failing due to Pod Security standard

OCP 4.14 introduced pod security standards that meant the `privileged` profile is `enforced`. In previous releases of OADP, this profile caused the pod to receive `permission denied` errors. This issue was caused because of the restore order. The pod was created before the security context constraints (SCC) resource. As this pod violated the pod security standard, the pod was denied and subsequently failed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2420[OADP-2420]


.Restore partially failing for job resource

In previous releases of OADP, the restore of job resource was partially failing in OCP 4.14. This issue was not seen in older OCP versions. The issue was caused by an additional label being to the job resource, which was not present in older OCP versions. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2530[OADP-2530]

.Data Mover can restore from an incorrect snapshot when there was more than one VSR for the restore name and pvc name

In previous releases of OADP, OADP Data Mover could restore from an incorrect snapshot if there was more than one Volume Snapshot Restore (VSR) resource in the cluster for the same Velero `restore` name and PersistentVolumeClaim (pvc) name. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-1822[OADP-1822]


.Cloud Storage API BSLs need OwnerReference

In previous releases of OADP, ACM BackupSchedules failed validation because of a missing `OwnerReference` on Backup Storage Locations (BSLs) created with `dpa.spec.backupLocations.bucket`. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-1511[OADP-1511]

[id="known-issues1.1.4_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

.OADP backups might fail because a UID/GID range might have changed on the cluster

OADP backups might fail because a UID/GID range might have changed on the cluster where the application has been restored, with the result that OADP does not back up and restore {product-title} UID/GID range metadata. To avoid the issue, if the backed application requires a specific UUID, ensure the range is available when restored. An additional workaround is to allow OADP to create the namespace in the restore operation.

.A restoration might fail if ArgoCD is used during the process due to a label used by ArgoCD

A restoration might fail if ArgoCD is used during the process due to a label used by ArgoCD, `app.kubernetes.io/instance`. This label identifies which resources ArgoCD needs to manage, which can create a conflict with OADP's procedure for managing resources on restoration. To work around this issue, set `.spec.resourceTrackingMethod` on the ArgoCD YAML to `annotation+label` or `annotation`. If the issue continues to persist, then disable ArgoCD before beginning to restore, and enable it again when restoration is finished.

[id="known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* OADP currently does not support backup and restore of AWS EFS volumes using restic in Velero (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-778[*OADP-778*]).

* CSI backups might fail due to a Ceph limitation of `VolumeSnapshotContent` snapshots per PVC.
+
You can create many snapshots of the same persistent volume claim (PVC) but cannot schedule periodic creation of snapshots:
+
--
** For CephFS, you can create up to 100 snapshots per PVC. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-804[*OADP-804*])
** For RADOS Block Device (RBD), you can create up to 512 snapshots for each PVC. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-975[*OADP-975*])

= OADP 1.1.1 release notes

The OADP 1.1.1 release notes include product recommendations and descriptions of known issues.

== Product recommendations

Before you install OADP 1.1.1, it is recommended to either install VolSync 0.5.1 or to upgrade to it.

== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* Multiple HTTP/2 enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (Rapid Reset Attack)
+
The HTTP/2 protocol is susceptible to a denial of service attack because request cancellation can reset multiple streams quickly. The server has to set up and tear down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection. This results in a denial of service due to server resource consumption. For a list of all OADP issues associated with this CVE, see the following link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2868?filter=12421248[Jira list].
+
It is advised to upgrade to OADP 1.1.7 or 1.2.3, which resolve this issue.
+
For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-39325[CVE-2023-39325 (Rapid Reset Attack)].
