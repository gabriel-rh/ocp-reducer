To restore the cluster to a previous state, you must have previously xref:../../../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backing-up-etcd-data_backup-etcd[backed up etcd data] by creating a snapshot. You will use this snapshot to restore the cluster state.

= About restoring cluster state

You can use an etcd backup to restore your cluster to a previous state. This can be used to recover from the following situations:

* The cluster has lost the majority of control plane hosts (quorum loss).
* An administrator has deleted something critical and must restore to recover the cluster.

[WARNING]
====
Restoring to a previous cluster state is a destructive and destablizing action to take on a running cluster. This should only be used as a last resort.

If you are able to retrieve data using the Kubernetes API server, then etcd is available and you should not restore using an etcd backup.
====

Restoring etcd effectively takes a cluster back in time and all clients will experience a conflicting, parallel history. This can impact the behavior of watching components like kubelets, Kubernetes controller managers, SDN controllers, and persistent volume controllers.

It can cause Operator churn when the content in etcd does not match the actual content on disk, causing Operators for the Kubernetes API server, Kubernetes controller manager, Kubernetes scheduler, and etcd to get stuck when files on disk conflict with content in etcd. This can require manual actions to resolve the issues.

In extreme cases, the cluster can lose track of persistent volumes, delete critical workloads that no longer exist, reimage machines, and rewrite CA bundles with expired certificates.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="dr-scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state_{context}"]
= Restoring to a previous cluster state

You can use a saved etcd backup to restore a previous cluster state or restore a cluster that has lost the majority of control plane hosts.

[NOTE]
====
If your cluster uses a control plane machine set, see "Troubleshooting the control plane machine set" for a more simple etcd recovery procedure.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you restore your cluster, you must use an etcd backup that was taken from the same z-stream release. For example, an {product-title} 4.7.2 cluster must use an etcd backup that was taken from 4.7.2.
====

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role through a certificate-based `kubeconfig` file, like the one that was used during installation.
* A healthy control plane host to use as the recovery host.
* SSH access to control plane hosts.
* A backup directory containing both the etcd snapshot and the resources for the static pods, which were from the same backup. The file names in the directory must be in the following formats: `snapshot_<datetimestamp>.db` and `static_kuberesources_<datetimestamp>.tar.gz`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For non-recovery control plane nodes, it is not required to establish SSH connectivity or to stop the static pods. You can delete and recreate other non-recovery, control plane machines, one by one.
====

.Procedure

. Select a control plane host to use as the recovery host. This is the host that you will run the restore operation on.

. Establish SSH connectivity to each of the control plane nodes, including the recovery host.
+
The Kubernetes API server becomes inaccessible after the restore process starts, so you cannot access the control plane nodes. For this reason, it is recommended to establish SSH connectivity to each control plane host in a separate terminal.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not complete this step, you will not be able to access the control plane hosts to complete the restore procedure, and you will be unable to recover your cluster from this state.
====

. Copy the etcd backup directory to the recovery control plane host.
+
This procedure assumes that you copied the `backup` directory containing the etcd snapshot and the resources for the static pods to the `/home/core/` directory of your recovery control plane host.

. Stop the static pods on any other control plane nodes.
+
[NOTE]
====
You do not need to stop the static pods on the recovery host.
====

.. Access a control plane host that is not the recovery host.

.. Move the existing etcd pod file out of the kubelet manifest directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd-pod.yaml /tmp
----

.. Verify that the etcd pods are stopped.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo crictl ps | grep etcd | egrep -v "operator|etcd-guard"
----
+
The output of this command should be empty. If it is not empty, wait a few minutes and check again.

.. Move the existing Kubernetes API server pod file out of the kubelet manifest directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver-pod.yaml /tmp
----

.. Verify that the Kubernetes API server pods are stopped.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver | egrep -v "operator|guard"
----
+
The output of this command should be empty. If it is not empty, wait a few minutes and check again.

.. Move the etcd data directory to a different location:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mv /var/lib/etcd/ /tmp
----

.. Repeat this step on each of the other control plane hosts that is not the recovery host.

. Access the recovery control plane host.

. If the cluster-wide proxy is enabled, be sure that you have exported the `NO_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.
+
[TIP]
====
You can check whether the proxy is enabled by reviewing the output of `oc get proxy cluster -o yaml`. The proxy is enabled if the `httpProxy`, `httpsProxy`, and `noProxy` fields have values set.
====

. Run the restore script on the recovery control plane host and pass in the path to the etcd backup directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo -E /usr/local/bin/cluster-restore.sh /home/core/backup
----
+

. If you are using the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, restart the Open Virtual Network (OVN) Kubernetes pods on all the nodes one by one. Use the following steps to restart OVN-Kubernetes pods on each node:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
.Restart OVN-Kubernetes pods in the following order:
. The recovery control plane host
. The other control plane hosts (if available)
. The other nodes
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Validating and mutating admission webhooks can reject pods. If you add any additional webhooks with the `failurePolicy` set to `Fail`, then they can reject pods and the restoration process can fail. You can avoid this by saving and deleting webhooks while restoring the cluster state. After the cluster state is restored successfully, you can enable the webhooks again.

Alternatively, you can temporarily set the `failurePolicy` to `Ignore` while restoring the cluster state. After the cluster state is restored successfully, you can set the `failurePolicy` to `Fail`.
====

.. Remove the northbound database (nbdb) and southbound database (sbdb). Access the recovery host and the remaining control plane nodes by using Secure Shell (SSH) and run the following command:

+
[NOTE]
====
It might take several minutes for the pods to restart.

To ensure that all workloads return to normal operation following a recovery procedure, restart each pod that stores Kubernetes API information. This includes {product-title} components such as routers, Operators, and third-party components.

[NOTE]
====
On completion of the previous procedural steps, you might need to wait a few minutes for all services to return to their restored state. For example, authentication by using `oc login` might not immediately work until the OAuth server pods are restarted.

Consider using the `system:admin` `kubeconfig` file for immediate authentication. This method basis its authentication on SSL/TLS client certificates as against OAuth tokens. You can authenticate with this file by issuing the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig
----

Issue the following command to display your authenticated user name:

[source,terminal]

$ oc whoami

[id="dr-scenario-cluster-state-issues_{context}"]
= Issues and workarounds for restoring a persistent storage state

If your {product-title} cluster uses persistent storage of any form, a state of the cluster is typically stored outside etcd. It might be an Elasticsearch cluster running in a pod or a database running in a `StatefulSet` object. When you restore from an etcd backup, the status of the workloads in {product-title} is also restored. However, if the etcd snapshot is old, the status might be invalid or outdated.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The contents of persistent volumes (PVs) are never part of the etcd snapshot. When you restore an {product-title} cluster from an etcd snapshot, non-critical workloads might gain access to critical data, or vice-versa.
====

The following are some example scenarios that produce an out-of-date status:

* MySQL database is running in a pod backed up by a PV object. Restoring {product-title} from an etcd snapshot does not bring back the volume on the storage provider, and does not produce a running MySQL pod, despite the pod repeatedly attempting to start. You must manually restore this pod by restoring the volume on the storage provider, and then editing the PV to point to the new volume.

* Pod P1 is using volume A, which is attached to node X. If the etcd snapshot is taken while another pod uses the same volume on node Y, then when the etcd restore is performed, pod P1 might not be able to start correctly due to the volume still being attached to node Y. {product-title} is not aware of the attachment, and does not automatically detach it. When this occurs, the volume must be manually detached from node Y so that the volume can attach on node X, and then pod P1 can start.

* Cloud provider or storage provider credentials were updated after the etcd snapshot was taken. This causes any CSI drivers or Operators that depend on the those credentials to not work. You might have to manually update the credentials required by those drivers or Operators.

* A device is removed or renamed from {product-title} nodes after the etcd snapshot is taken. The Local Storage Operator creates symlinks for each PV that it manages from `/dev/disk/by-id` or `/dev` directories. This situation might cause the local PVs to refer to devices that no longer exist.
+
To fix this problem, an administrator must:

. Manually remove the PVs with invalid devices.
. Remove symlinks from respective nodes.
. Delete `LocalVolume` or `LocalVolumeSet` objects (see _Storage_ -> _Configuring persistent storage_ -> _Persistent storage using local volumes_ -> _Deleting the Local Storage Operator Resources_).
