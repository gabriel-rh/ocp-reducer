toc::[]

This document describes the process to replace a single unhealthy etcd member.

This process depends on whether the etcd member is unhealthy because the machine is not running or the node is not ready, or whether it is unhealthy because the etcd pod is crashlooping.

[NOTE]
====
If you have lost the majority of your control plane hosts, follow the disaster recovery procedure to xref:../../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore to a previous cluster state] instead of this procedure.

If the control plane certificates are not valid on the member being replaced, then you must follow the procedure to xref:../../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-3-expired-certs.adoc#dr-recovering-expired-certs[recover from expired control plane certificates] instead of this procedure.

If a control plane node is lost and a new one is created, the etcd cluster Operator handles generating the new TLS certificates and adding the node as an etcd member.
====

== Prerequisites

* Take an xref:../../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backing-up-etcd-data_backup-etcd[etcd backup] prior to replacing an unhealthy etcd member.

// Identifying an unhealthy etcd member
:leveloffset: +1

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * backup_and_restore/replacing-unhealthy-etcd-member.adoc

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="restore-identify-unhealthy-etcd-member_{context}"]
= Identifying an unhealthy etcd member

You can identify if your cluster has an unhealthy etcd member.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Check the status of the `EtcdMembersAvailable` status condition using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get etcd -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="EtcdMembersAvailable")]}{.message}{"\n"}'
----

. Review the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
2 of 3 members are available, ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal is unhealthy
----
+
This example output shows that the `ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal` etcd member is unhealthy.

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="restore-determine-state-etcd-member_{context}"]
= Determining the state of the unhealthy etcd member

The steps to replace an unhealthy etcd member depend on which of the following states your etcd member is in:

* The machine is not running or the node is not ready
* The etcd pod is crashlooping

This procedure determines which state your etcd member is in. This enables you to know which procedure to follow to replace the unhealthy etcd member.

[NOTE]
====
If you are aware that the machine is not running or the node is not ready, but you expect it to return to a healthy state soon, then you do not need to perform a procedure to replace the etcd member. The etcd cluster Operator will automatically sync when the machine or node returns to a healthy state.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have identified an unhealthy etcd member.

.Procedure

. Determine if the *machine is not running*:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machines -A -ojsonpath='{range .items[*]}{@.status.nodeRef.name}{"\t"}{@.status.providerStatus.instanceState}{"\n"}' | grep -v running
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal  stopped <1>
----
<1> This output lists the node and the status of the node's machine. If the status is anything other than `running`, then the *machine is not running*.
+
// TODO: xref
If the *machine is not running*, then follow the _Replacing an unhealthy etcd member whose machine is not running or whose node is not ready_ procedure.


. Determine if the *node is not ready*.
+
If either of the following scenarios are true, then the *node is not ready*.

** If the machine is running, then check whether the node is unreachable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{range .spec.taints[*]}{.key}{" "}' | grep unreachable
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal	node-role.kubernetes.io/master node.kubernetes.io/unreachable node.kubernetes.io/unreachable <1>
----
<1> If the node is listed with an `unreachable` taint, then the *node is not ready*.

** If the node is still reachable, then check whether the node is listed as `NotReady`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master | grep "NotReady"
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal   NotReady   master   122m   v1.27.3 <1>
----
<1> If the node is listed as `NotReady`, then the *node is not ready*.

+
// TODO: xref
If the *node is not ready*, then follow the _Replacing an unhealthy etcd member whose machine is not running or whose node is not ready_ procedure.


. Determine if the *etcd pod is crashlooping*.
+
If the machine is running and the node is ready, then check whether the etcd pod is crashlooping.

.. Verify that all control plane nodes are listed as `Ready`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

== Replacing the unhealthy etcd member

Depending on the state of your unhealthy etcd member, use one of the following procedures:

* xref:../../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/replacing-unhealthy-etcd-member.adoc#restore-replace-stopped-etcd-member_replacing-unhealthy-etcd-member[Replacing an unhealthy etcd member whose machine is not running or whose node is not ready]

// * backup_and_restore/replacing-unhealthy-etcd-member.adoc

:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="restore-replace-stopped-etcd-member_{context}"]
= Replacing an unhealthy etcd member whose machine is not running or whose node is not ready

This procedure details the steps to replace an etcd member that is unhealthy either because the machine is not running or because the node is not ready.

[NOTE]
====
If your cluster uses a control plane machine set, see "Recovering a degraded etcd Operator" in "Troubleshooting the control plane machine set" for a more simple etcd recovery procedure.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have identified the unhealthy etcd member.
* You have verified that either the machine is not running or the node is not ready.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must wait if the other control plane nodes are powered off. The control plane nodes must remain powered off until the replacement of an unhealthy etcd member is complete.
====
+
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have taken an etcd backup.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to take an etcd backup before performing this procedure so that your cluster can be restored if you encounter any issues.
====

.Procedure

. Remove the unhealthy member.

.. Choose a pod that is _not_ on the affected node:
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-etcd get pods -l k8s-app=etcd
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
etcd-ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal                3/3     Running     0          123m
etcd-ip-10-0-164-97.ec2.internal                 3/3     Running     0          123m
etcd-ip-10-0-154-204.ec2.internal                3/3     Running     0          124m
----

.. Connect to the running etcd container, passing in the name of a pod that is not on the affected node:
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-ip-10-0-154-204.ec2.internal
----

.. View the member list:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl member list -w table

+------------------+---------+------------------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
----
+
Take note of the ID and the name of the unhealthy etcd member, because these values are needed later in the procedure. The `$ etcdctl endpoint health` command will list the removed member until the procedure of replacement is finished and a new member is added.

.. Remove the unhealthy etcd member by providing the ID to the `etcdctl member remove` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl member remove 6fc1e7c9db35841d
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Member 6fc1e7c9db35841d removed from cluster ead669ce1fbfb346
----

.. View the member list again and verify that the member was removed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl member list -w table
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

+------------------+---------+------------------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
----
+
You can now exit the node shell.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
After you remove the member, the cluster might be unreachable for a short time while the remaining etcd instances reboot.
====

. Turn off the quorum guard by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch etcd/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"unsupportedConfigOverrides": {"useUnsupportedUnsafeNonHANonProductionUnstableEtcd": true}}}'
----
+
This command ensures that you can successfully re-create secrets and roll out the static pods.

. Remove the old secrets for the unhealthy etcd member that was removed.

.. List the secrets for the unhealthy etcd member that was removed.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secrets -n openshift-etcd | grep ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal <1>
----
<1> Pass in the name of the unhealthy etcd member that you took note of earlier in this procedure.
+
There is a peer, serving, and metrics secret as shown in the following output:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

----

.. Delete the secrets for the unhealthy etcd member that was removed.

... Delete the peer secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret -n openshift-etcd etcd-peer-ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal
----

... Delete the serving secret:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret -n openshift-etcd etcd-serving-ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal
----

... Delete the metrics secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret -n openshift-etcd etcd-serving-metrics-ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal
----

. Delete and recreate the control plane machine. After this machine is recreated, a new revision is forced and etcd scales up automatically.
+
If you are running installer-provisioned infrastructure, or you used the Machine API to create your machines, follow these steps. Otherwise, you must create the new master using the same method that was used to originally create it.

.. Obtain the machine for the unhealthy member.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:

[id="restore-replace-crashlooping-etcd-member_{context}"]
= Replacing an unhealthy etcd member whose etcd pod is crashlooping

This procedure details the steps to replace an etcd member that is unhealthy because the etcd pod is crashlooping.

.Prerequisites

* You have identified the unhealthy etcd member.
* You have verified that the etcd pod is crashlooping.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have taken an etcd backup.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to take an etcd backup before performing this procedure so that your cluster can be restored if you encounter any issues.
====

.Procedure

. Stop the crashlooping etcd pod.

.. Debug the node that is crashlooping.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal <1>
----
<1> Replace this with the name of the unhealthy node.

.. Change your root directory to `/host`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# chroot /host
----

.. Move the existing etcd pod file out of the kubelet manifest directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# mkdir /var/lib/etcd-backup
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd-pod.yaml /var/lib/etcd-backup/
----

.. Move the etcd data directory to a different location:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# mv /var/lib/etcd/ /tmp
----
+
You can now exit the node shell.

. Remove the unhealthy member.

.. Choose a pod that is _not_ on the affected node.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-etcd get pods -l k8s-app=etcd

This procedure details the steps to replace a bare metal etcd member that is unhealthy either because the machine is not running or because the node is not ready.

If you are running installer-provisioned infrastructure or you used the Machine API to create your machines, follow these steps. Otherwise you must create the new control plane node using the same method that was used to originally create it.

.Prerequisites

* You have identified the unhealthy bare metal etcd member.
* You have verified that either the machine is not running or the node is not ready.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have taken an etcd backup.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must take an etcd backup before performing this procedure so that your cluster can be restored if you encounter any issues.
====

.Procedure

. Verify and remove the unhealthy member.

.. Choose a pod that is _not_ on the affected node:
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-etcd get pods -l k8s-app=etcd -o wide
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

----
.. Connect to the running etcd container, passing in the name of a pod that is not on the affected node:
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-openshift-control-plane-0
----

.. View the member list:
+
[source,terminal]

----
+
Take note of the ID and the name of the unhealthy etcd member, because these values are required later in the procedure. The `etcdctl endpoint health` command will list the removed member until the replacement procedure is completed and the new member is added.

.. Remove the unhealthy etcd member by providing the ID to the `etcdctl member remove` command:
+
[WARNING]
====
Be sure to remove the correct etcd member; removing a good etcd member might lead to quorum loss.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After you remove the member, the cluster might be unreachable for a short time while the remaining etcd instances reboot.
====

. Turn off the quorum guard by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch etcd/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"unsupportedConfigOverrides": {"useUnsupportedUnsafeNonHANonProductionUnstableEtcd": true}}}'
----
+
This command ensures that you can successfully re-create secrets and roll out the static pods.

. Remove the old secrets for the unhealthy etcd member that was removed by running the following commands.

.. List the secrets for the unhealthy etcd member that was removed.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secrets -n openshift-etcd | grep openshift-control-plane-2
----
Pass in the name of the unhealthy etcd member that you took note of earlier in this procedure.
+
There is a peer, serving, and metrics secret as shown in the following output:
+

If you reuse the `BareMetalHost` object definition from an existing control plane host, do not leave the `externallyProvisioned` field set to `true`.

Existing control plane `BareMetalHost` objects may have the `externallyProvisioned` flag set to `true` if they were provisioned by the {product-title} installation program.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch etcd/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"unsupportedConfigOverrides": null}}'

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get etcd/cluster -oyaml

.Verification

. Verify that all etcd pods are running properly.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-etcd get pods -l k8s-app=etcd
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
etcd-openshift-control-plane-0      5/5     Running     0     105m
etcd-openshift-control-plane-1      5/5     Running     0     107m
etcd-openshift-control-plane-2      5/5     Running     0     103m
----
+
If the output from the previous command only lists two pods, you can manually force an etcd redeployment. In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch etcd cluster -p='{"spec": {"forceRedeploymentReason": "recovery-'"$( date --rfc-3339=ns )"'"}}' --type=merge <1>
----
+
<1> The `forceRedeploymentReason` value must be unique, which is why a timestamp is appended.
+
To verify there are exactly three etcd members, connect to the running etcd container, passing in the name of a pod that was not on the affected node. In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-openshift-control-plane-0
----
+
. View the member list:
