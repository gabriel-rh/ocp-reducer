== Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[our CTO Chris Wright's message].


== About Red Hat {VirtProductName}

Red Hat {VirtProductName} enables you to bring traditional virtual machines (VMs) into {product-title} where they run alongside containers, and are managed as native Kubernetes objects.

{VirtProductName} is represented by the image:virt-icon.png[{VirtProductName},40,40] icon.

You can use {VirtProductName} with either the xref:../../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes] or the xref:../../networking/openshift_sdn/about-openshift-sdn.adoc#about-openshift-sdn[OpenShiftSDN] default Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider.

Learn more about xref:../../virt/about_virt/about-virt.adoc#about-virt[what you can do with {VirtProductName}].

The field that was previously named `mediatedDevicesTypes` is now named `mediatedDeviceTypes` to align with the naming convention used for the `nodeMediatedDeviceTypes` field. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2054863[*BZ#2054863*])

//CNV-20106 BZ 2092412
* Virtual machines created from common templates on a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) cluster no longer display a `VMCannotBeEvicted` alert when the cluster-level eviction strategy is `None` for SNO. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2092412[*BZ#2092412*])

//CNV-18526 BZ 2089301

(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2089301[*BZ#2089301*])

//BZ 2151169

(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2151169[*BZ#2151169*])

* When you use two pods with different SELinux contexts, VMs with the `ocs-storagecluster-cephfs` storage class no longer fail to migrate. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2092271[*BZ#2092271*])

==== Monitoring
//4.14 Leave in per Stu (fix deferring to 4.15)
* The Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) prevents pod disruptions for migratable virtual machine images.

* If your {product-title} cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes as the default Container Network Interface (CNI) provider, you cannot attach a Linux bridge or bonding device to a host's default interface because of a change in the host network topology of OVN-Kubernetes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1885605[*BZ#1885605*])
** As a workaround, you can use a secondary network interface connected to your host, or switch to the OpenShift SDN default CNI provider.

==== Nodes
//4.14 Leave in per Simone
* Uninstalling {VirtProductName} does not remove the `feature.node.kubevirt.io` node labels created by {VirtProductName}. You must remove the labels manually. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-22036[*CNV-22036*])

==== Storage
//4.14 Leave in per Adam
* In some instances, multiple virtual machines can mount the same PVC in read-write mode, which might result in data corruption. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1992753[*BZ#1992753*])
** As a workaround, avoid using a single PVC in read-write mode with multiple VMs.

//4.14 Leave in per Adam and Stu; will be doc'd in 4.15
* If you clone more than 100 VMs using the `csi-clone` cloning strategy, then the Ceph CSI might not purge the clones. Manually deleting the clones might also fail. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055595[*BZ#2055595*])
** As a workaround, you can restart the `ceph-mgr` to purge the VM clones.

//CNV-34198 (BZ 2237287)
* If you use Portworx as your storage solution on AWS and create a VM disk image, the created image might be smaller than expected due to the filesystem overhead being accounted for twice. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2237287[*BZ#2237287*])
** As a workaround, you can manually expand the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to increase the available space after the initial provisioning process completes.

//BZ2216038 from Ying
* If you simultaneously clone more than 1000 VMs using the provided DataSources in the `openshift-virtualization-os-images` namespace, it is possible that not all of the VMs will move to a running state. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2216038[*BZ#2216038*])
** As a workaround, deploy VMs in smaller batches.

//BZ2247593 from Ying
* Live migration cannot be enabled for a virtual machine instance (VMI) after a hotplug volume has been added and removed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055595[*BZ#2247593*])

[id="virt-4-14-ki-virtualization"]
==== Virtualization
//4.14 Leave in per Stu
* {VirtProductName} links a service account token in use by a pod to that specific pod. {VirtProductName} implements a service account volume by creating a disk image that contains a token. If you migrate a VM, then the service account volume becomes invalid. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037611[*BZ#2037611*])
** As a workaround, use user accounts rather than service accounts because user account tokens are not bound to a specific pod.

// Leave in for 4.14 per Stu; remove from 4.15 RNs and move content to CNV docs, per Avital
* With the release of the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:3722[RHSA-2023:3722] advisory, the TLS `Extended Master Secret` (EMS) extension (link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7627[RFC 7627]) is mandatory for TLS 1.2 connections on FIPS-enabled RHEL 9 systems. This is in accordance with FIPS-140-3 requirements. TLS 1.3 is not affected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2157951[*BZ#2157951*])
+
Legacy OpenSSL clients that do not support EMS or TLS 1.3 now cannot connect to FIPS servers running on RHEL 9. Similarly, RHEL 9 clients in FIPS mode cannot connect to servers that only support TLS 1.2 without EMS. This in practice means that these clients cannot connect to servers on RHEL 6, RHEL 7 and non-RHEL legacy operating systems. This is because the legacy 1.0.x versions of OpenSSL do not support EMS or TLS 1.3. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7018256[TLS Extension "Extended Master Secret" enforced with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2].
+
As a workaround, upgrade legacy OpenSSL clients to a version that supports TLS 1.3 and configure {VirtProductName} to use TLS 1.3, with the `Modern` TLS security profile type, for FIPS mode.

[id="virt-4-14-ki-webconsole"]
==== Web console
//CNV-34771 from Ying
* If you upgrade {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14 without upgrading {VirtProductName}, the Virtualization pages of the web console crash. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=OCPBUGS-22853[*OCPBUGS-22853*])
+
You must upgrade the {VirtProductName} Operator to 4.14 manually or set your subscription approval strategy to "Automatic."
