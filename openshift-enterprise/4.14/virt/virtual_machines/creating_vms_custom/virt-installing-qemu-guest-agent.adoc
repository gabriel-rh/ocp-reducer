toc::[]

The QEMU guest agent is a daemon that runs on the virtual machine (VM) and passes information to the host about the VM, users, file systems, and secondary networks.

You must install the QEMU guest agent on VMs created from operating system images that are not provided by Red Hat.

= Installing the QEMU guest agent on a Linux VM

The `qemu-guest-agent` is widely available and available by default in {op-system-base-full} virtual machines (VMs). Install the agent and start the service.

[NOTE]
====
To create snapshots of an online (Running state) VM with the highest integrity, install the QEMU guest agent.

The QEMU guest agent takes a consistent snapshot by attempting to quiesce the VM file system as much as possible, depending on the system workload. This ensures that in-flight I/O is written to the disk before the snapshot is taken. If the guest agent is not present, quiescing is not possible and a best-effort snapshot is taken. The conditions under which the snapshot was taken are reflected in the snapshot indications that are displayed in the web console or CLI.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the VM by using a console or SSH.

. Install the QEMU guest agent by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ yum install -y qemu-guest-agent
----

. Ensure the service is persistent and start it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ systemctl enable --now qemu-guest-agent
----

.Verification
* Run the following command to verify that `AgentConnected` is listed in the VM spec:

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get vm <vm_name>
----

For Windows virtual machines (VMs), the QEMU guest agent is included in the VirtIO drivers. You can install the drivers during a Windows installation or on an existing Windows VM.

[NOTE]

[id="installing-virtio-drivers"]
== Installing VirtIO drivers on Windows VMs

VirtIO drivers are paravirtualized device drivers required for Microsoft Windows virtual machines (VMs) to run in {VirtProductName}. The supported drivers are
available in the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk of the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/search?q=virtio-win&p=1[Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog].

The `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk must be attached to the VM as a SATA CD drive to enable driver installation. You can install VirtIO drivers during Windows installation or added to an existing Windows installation.

After the drivers are installed, the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk can be removed from the VM.

.Supported drivers
[options="header"]
|===
|Driver name |Hardware ID |Description

|*viostor*
|VEN_1AF4&DEV_1001 +
VEN_1AF4&DEV_1042
|The block driver. Sometimes labeled as an *SCSI Controller* in the *Other devices* group.

|*viorng*
|VEN_1AF4&DEV_1005 +
VEN_1AF4&DEV_1044
|The entropy source driver. Sometimes labeled as a *PCI Device* in the *Other devices* group.

|*NetKVM*
|VEN_1AF4&DEV_1000 +
VEN_1AF4&DEV_1041
|The network driver. Sometimes labeled as an *Ethernet Controller* in the *Other devices* group. Available only if a VirtIO NIC is configured.

[id="virt-installing-virtio-drivers-installing-windows_{context}"]
= Installing VirtIO drivers during Windows installation

You can install the VirtIO drivers while installing Windows on a virtual machine (VM).

[NOTE]
====
This procedure uses a generic approach to the Windows installation and the installation method might differ between versions of Windows. See the documentation for the version of Windows that you are installing.
====

.Prerequisites

* A storage device containing the `virtio` drivers must be attached to the VM.

.Procedure

. In the Windows operating system, use the `File Explorer` to navigate to the `virtio-win` CD drive.
. Double-click the drive to run the appropriate installer for your VM.
+
For a 64-bit vCPU, select the `virtio-win-gt-x64` installer. 32-bit vCPUs are no longer supported.

. Optional: During the *Custom Setup* step of the installer, select the device drivers you want to install. The recommended driver set is selected by default.
. After the installation is complete, select *Finish*.
. Reboot the VM.

.Verification

. Open the system disk on the PC. This is typically `C:`.
. Navigate to *Program Files* -> *Virtio-Win*.

If the *Virtio-Win* directory is present and contains a sub-directory for each driver, the installation was successful.

[id="virt-installing-virtio-drivers-existing-windows_{context}"]
= Installing VirtIO drivers from a SATA CD drive on an existing Windows VM

You can install the VirtIO drivers from a SATA CD drive on an existing Windows virtual machine (VM).

[NOTE]
====
This procedure uses a generic approach to adding drivers to Windows. See the installation documentation for your version of Windows for specific installation steps.
====

.Prerequisites

* A storage device containing the virtio drivers must be attached to the VM as a SATA CD drive.

.Procedure

. Start the VM and connect to a graphical console.
. Log in to a Windows user session.
. Open *Device Manager* and expand *Other devices* to list any *Unknown device*.
.. Open the *Device Properties* to identify the unknown device.
.. Right-click the device and select *Properties*.
.. Click the *Details* tab and select *Hardware Ids* in the *Property* list.
.. Compare the *Value* for the *Hardware Ids* with the supported VirtIO drivers.

. Right-click the device and select *Update Driver Software*.
. Click *Browse my computer for driver software* and browse to the attached
SATA CD drive, where the VirtIO drivers are located. The drivers are arranged
hierarchically according to their driver type, operating system,
and CPU architecture.
. Click *Next* to install the driver.
. Repeat this process for all the necessary VirtIO drivers.
. After the driver installs, click *Close* to close the window.
. Reboot the VM to complete the driver installation.

[id="virt-adding-container-disk-as-cd_{context}"]
= Installing VirtIO drivers from a container disk added as a SATA CD drive

You can install VirtIO drivers from a container disk that you add to a Windows virtual machine (VM) as a SATA CD drive.

[TIP]
====
Downloading the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk from the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/search?q=virtio-win&p=1[Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog] is not mandatory, because the container disk is downloaded from the Red Hat registry if it not already present in the cluster. However, downloading reduces the installation time.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to the Red Hat registry or to the downloaded `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk in a restricted environment.

.Procedure

. Add the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk as a CD drive by editing the `VirtualMachine` manifest:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      disks:
        - name: virtiocontainerdisk
          bootOrder: 2 <1>
          cdrom:
            bus: sata
volumes:
  - containerDisk:
      image: container-native-virtualization/virtio-win
    name: virtiocontainerdisk
----
<1> {VirtProductName} boots the VM disks in the order defined in the `VirtualMachine` manifest. You can either define other VM disks that boot before the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk or use the optional `bootOrder` parameter to ensure the VM boots from the correct disk. If you configure the boot order for a disk, you must configure the boot order for the other disks.

. Apply the changes:
* If the VM is not running, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl start <vm>
----

* If the VM is running, reboot the VM or run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <vm.yaml>
----

. After the VM has started, install the VirtIO drivers from the SATA CD drive.
